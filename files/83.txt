   ITEM 1. BUSINESS

   (a)  General Development of Business and Recent Events.

        1.  Introduction.

            Multigraphics, Inc. is  incorporated in Delaware.   As  used
   herein, "Registrant" or the "Company" means Multigraphics, Inc.,  and
   its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates the contrary.

            Registrant  is  a  distributor  of  an  extensive  range  of
   equipment and supplies  and a service  provider to  the U.S.  graphic
   arts industry.    Registrant  has completed  its  transition  from  a
   manufacturer of  offset  duplicating  machines  to  focus  solely  on
   distribution of equipment and supplies  and providing service to  the
   graphic arts industry.  The Registrant sells a variety of  equipment,
   systems  and  supplies  under  the  Multigraphics  brand  name   and
   increasingly   is   selling   products   carrying   the    applicable
   manufacturers' brand names.

            Since  December of  1997,  the  Company  has  acquired  four
   regional graphic arts dealers  as part of  its strategy of  expanding
   its target  customer base  in the  in-plant and  smaller to  mid-size
   commercial printing market segments.  The acquisitions have broadened
   the Company's product-line, service capabilities and opportunities.

            In  the last  thirty-six  months,  as  previously  reported,
   Registrant has divested its Sheridan  Systems and AM Multigraphics  -
   International business  segments.    On  May 28,  1997,  Registrant's
   stockholders  approved   a  change   in  corporate   name  from   "AM
   International, Inc."  to "Multigraphics,  Inc." to  reflect the  name
   known to customers of  Registrant's sole remaining business  segment,
   and to reflect the fact that the Company has exited its international
   operations.

            On August  27, 1996,  Registrant sold  substantially all  of
   the assets  and  liabilities  of the  Sheridan  Systems  division,  a
   leading supplier of systems and components  to both the printing  and
   newspaper publishing industries,  to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen  AG.
   The sale included substantially all of the assets and liabilities  of
   Registrant's AM Graphics International Limited subsidiary in  Slough,
   England.
 <PAGE>

            The disposition  of  the AM  Multigraphics  -  International
   business segment took  place in  stages, as  Registrant divested  its
   unprofitable foreign subsidiaries as well as  its 67% interest in  AM
   Japan Co., Ltd.  In February, 1996, Registrant's AM International  UK
   Limited  subsidiary  in  England   entered  into  an   Administration
   Proceeding, which resulted in  the sale of  certain portions of  that
   business.  In  March, 1996, Registrant  sold its Netherlands  holding
   company, including its  subsidiaries in the  Netherlands, France  and
   Belgium, to  a local  management buyout  team.   In September,  1996,
   Registrant sold its interest  in AM Japan Co.,  Ltd., and on  October
   17,  1996,  Registrant's  Canadian  subsidiary  initiated  bankruptcy
   proceedings.

            All financial information has  been restated to reflect  the
   Sheridan Systems and the AM Multigraphics - International  operations
   as discontinued operations.

        2.  Bankruptcy Proceedings.

            On   May  17,   1993,   Registrant   and   its   subsidiary,
   Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation  ("AMC"), filed  for  protection
   under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in The  United
   States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy
   Court")  case  numbers   93-582  through   93-583  (the   "Bankruptcy
   Proceedings").  Registrant also filed on that date a proposed Plan of
   Reorganization.   The  Chapter  11  filing  related  to  Registrant's
   domestic operations and did not include its foreign subsidiaries.

            On August 26,  1993, a hearing  was held  by the  Bankruptcy
   Court  to  consider  approval  of   a  Disclosure  Statement  to   be
   distributed to creditors and stockholders of Registrant.  After  that
   hearing, and by Order of the Bankruptcy Court dated August 26,  1993,
   the Second Amended Disclosure Statement (hereinafter the  "Disclosure
   Statement") was approved.  Further  information on the First  Amended
   Plan of Reorganization as amended by  Amendment No. 1 thereto (as  so
   amended the  "Reorganization  Plan")  and  the  disclosures  made  in
   connection therewith, is  available in the  Disclosure Statement  and
   the Reorganization Plan incorporated herein by reference to  Exhibits
   28 and 10(A), respectively,  to the Company's  Annual Report on  Form
   10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1993, File No. 1-683.

        3.  Events Leading to Bankruptcy Proceedings.

            Reference  is  made  to  Section  D  of  Part  III  of   the
   Disclosure  Statement  (pages  22  to  29),  incorporated  herein  by
   reference to Exhibit 28 to the  Company's Annual Report on Form  10-K
   for the  fiscal  year  ended  July 31,  1993,  File  No.  1-683,  for
   information on the general development of the business of  Registrant
   and events which led to commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceedings on
   May 17, 1993.

        4.  Corporate Structure of Registrant.
 <PAGE>
            Registrant,    Multigraphics,    Inc.,    was     originally
   incorporated  in  Delaware  in   1924  as  Addressograph   Securities
   Corporation.  Registrant has had several  name changes, one of  which
   was Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation for  the period May 6,  1931
   to January 2, 1979.  As noted above, Registrant changed its name from
   "AM International, Inc."  to "Multigraphics, Inc."  on May 28,  1997.
   Registrant has one active subsidiary, Publishing Solutions Inc.

   (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments.

            The  information  in  the  section  entitled   "Management's
   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of
   Operations" and in Note  13 to the  "Notes to Consolidated  Financial
   Statements"  under   the  section   entitled  "Geographic   Segments"
   contained in  the  1998  Annual Report  are  incorporated  herein  by
   reference.

   (c) Narrative Description of Business.

            Registrant is a distributor of equipment and supplies and  a
   service provider to  the graphic arts  industry, and  has exited  the
   engineering and  manufacturing of  offset duplicating  equipment  and
   supplies to focus exclusively  on one business segment,  distributing
   equipment and supplies, and providing parts and service, to in-plant,
   franchise, and commercial printers.  The Registrant's strategy is  to
   achieve growth  within  the  graphic arts  market  by  expanding  its
   product offerings, enhancing its digital support capabilities, taking
   advantage of its unique national service capabilities and  increasing
   market penetration and coverage through a program of acquisitions  of
   regional dealers that compete in the fragmented graphic arts market.

            Since December 1997, Registrant  has acquired four  regional
   graphic arts dealers which  serve the same  general customer base  as
   the Registrant.  In December,  Registrant acquired certain assets  of
   Hanley Graphic Products Company, a  graphic arts dealer operating  in
   northern Illinois  with annual  revenues of  over  $18 million.    In
   December, Registrant also acquired the stock of Publishing  Solutions
   Inc., a  privately held  Akron, Ohio  based systems  integrator  with
   annual revenues  of approximately  $9 million.    In June  1998,  the
   Company  acquired  certain  assets   of  Chicago  based   Progressive
   Lithoplate  and  Supply  Company,   which  had  annual  revenues   of
   approximately $5 million.  In September of 1998, the Company acquired
   certain assets  of Texas  PrePress Systems,  Inc., an  Austin,  Texas
   based prepress systems integrator  with revenues of approximately  $2
   million.

            The  acquisitions  complement   the  Registrant's   internal
   efforts to expand its product  offerings, and bring enhanced  digital
   sales and support capabilities, as well as an expanded customer  base
   in the  Registrant's  key markets.    In addition,  the  Company  has
   undertaken a marketing program focusing on obtaining national service
   accounts with  manufacturers and national retail outlets.
<PAGE>
            In  the  last  three  years,  Registrant  has  divested  its
   Sheridan Systems and AM Multigraphics - International business  units
   in previously reported transactions.  In December of 1996, Registrant
   and Xeikon, N.V. entered into  an agreement, as previously  reported,
   pursuant to which the  parties agreed not  to renew the  distribution
   agreement under which the Registrant distributed and serviced  Xeikon
   digital color presses in North America.

            Registrant currently has approximately 670 employees in  the
   United States and is headquartered in Mount Prospect, Illinois where,
   historically, it  has manufactured  and distributed  a broad  product
   line of equipment and supplies and provided services for the graphic
   arts industry through its own direct sales and service organizations.
   The Company's  products  traditionally  have  included  small  offset
   printing equipment, automated copy/duplicating systems, pre and  post
   press products and supplies.

            Presently, the  Company  has  completed its  exit  from  the
   engineering and  manufacturing  of offset  duplicating  equipment  to
   focus  entirely  on  distribution  of  equipment  and  supplies   and
   providing services  to  the  graphic  arts  industry.    The  Company
   primarily  serves  in-plant  printers  and  small  to  medium   sized
   commercial printers.   Declining market demand  for the  Registrant's
   traditional offset duplicator products, due to inroads by alternative
   technologies,  resulted  in  the  re-evaluation  of  its  traditional
   strategy and the  decision to exit  manufacturing.   The Company  has
   licensed the rights to manufacture  certain of its offset  duplicator
   products, and  therefore has  available to  it  and its  customers  a
   continuing supply of offset duplicator products.
<PAGE>
            The Company's supplies  and equipment  offerings consist  of
   consumable products used in the production of printed materials  such
   as films, inks, plates, rubber rollers, cleaning solutions and cotton
   pads, as well  as equipment  products such  as digital  imagesetters,
   platesetters, presses, folders  and cutters.   The Registrant  tracks
   various categories of these products, none of which accounts for more
   than 10% of its revenues.

            The Company's service  and parts  offerings include  service
   on over 250 models  of printing equipment  installed in in-plant  and
   small to  medium  sized  commercial  print  shops,  governmental  and
   educational institutions, as  well as national  retail outlets.   The
   Company  has  342   service  representatives,   and  offers   service
   capabilities in all 50 states.

            The following table sets forth the breakdown of revenues
   among machines, supplies and services in the United States, Canada
   and Japan for fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996:

            Registrant also distributes  products through  approximately
   51 independent dealers selling in approximately 46 countries.

            The  principal   distribution  and   service  customers   of
   Registrant include in-plant print  shops, franchised and  independent
   quick print  shops, small  to medium  sized commercial  printers  and
   governmental and educational institutions, and its service  customers
   also include manufacturers and national retail accounts.   Registrant
   has approximately 20,000  customers.  No  customer accounts for  more
   than 10% of Registrant's revenues.

   5.  Competition and Competitive Conditions.
<PAGE>
            The Company  operates  in  a highly  competitive  market  in
   which  price,  delivery  and   customer  service  are  key   factors.
   Historically, the Registrant developed its customer base of in-plant,
   quick print  and  small  to  medium  size  commercial  printers,  and
   governmental and  educational institutions  through the  sale of  its
   proprietary small offset duplicator presses.  Because the market  for
   such presses  is  mature  and  continues  to  face  competition  from
   alternative  technologies,  the  Company  has  had  to  refocus   its
   marketing  approach  to  emphasize   its  distribution  and   service
   capabilities in continuing to serve its market segments.

            As described above, the Company has completed its exit  from
   the manufacture  of  offset  duplicators  and  has  divested  certain
   unprofitable businesses  and product  lines.   These  cost  reduction
   efforts have contributed  to the Company's  return to  profitability,
   and the Company has developed strategies for achieving growth in  its
   traditional markets by expanding its product offerings, enhancing its
   digital support capabilities, taking advantage of its unique national
   service organization, and  by acquiring regional  dealers that  serve
   the same general customer base.   The Company has initiated  internal
   sales and marketing  programs which have  offset the  decline in  its
   supplies distribution  operations,  and has  recently  acquired  four
   regional  dealers   to   expand  its   product   offerings,   digital
   capabilities and customer base.   The Company  has also undertaken  a
   marketing program to  reverse the  long-term decline  in its  service
   operations by  focusing  on  manufacturers,  franchise  accounts  and
   national   retail   operations   which   prefer   national    service
   capabilities.

            Gross margins have decreased as  the Company has ceased  its
   manufacturing operations  and  switched  to  product  lines  obtained
   through distribution agreements, joint ventures and affiliations with
   third parties, and  acquisitions.  To  offset the  lower margins  the
   Company has invested in information systems and has undertaken  other
   reorganization measures to  increase efficiency  and lower  expenses.
   These  cost  reduction  efforts  continue.    The  Company  has  also
   undertaken  marketing  efforts  to  increase  both  its  distribution
   customer base and its higher margin service revenues.


            The  competitive  market  is  also  one  of  heavy  regional
   competition, with hundreds of regional  dealers.  A consolidation  of
   dealers, distributors  and suppliers  is  occurring, resulting  in  a
   consolidation of  buying power  and distribution  cost  efficiencies.
   The Registrant's  investments  in information  systems,  distribution
   outlets and other capabilities, its  marketing efforts to expand  its
   business opportunities with existing customers, its leveraging of its
   national service capabilities, and the addition of new customers  and
   capabilities through  acquisitions,  are  intended  to  increase  the
   Company's profitability  by  increasing  revenues  without  incurring
   proportionate increases in expense levels.  Registrant believes  that
   its renewed focus on its traditional customer base, the expansion  of
   its product lines,  and   its strategy  to make  acquisitions in  the
   graphic arts industry provide a sound basis for continued growth.

        6.  Cyclical Nature of Business and Liquidity.
<PAGE>
            The revenues of Registrant are dependent upon trends in  the
   printing industry,  which are  a function  of (among  other  factors)
   overall economic factors and advertising expenditures.   Registrant's
   backlog is less  than 5%  of annual revenues  and is  not a  material
   factor in  the conduct  of the  business.   Registrant believes  that
   substantially all of  this backlog will  be shipped  during the  1999
   fiscal year.

        7.  Research and Development; Patents and Trademarks.

            Although   Registrant   actively    seeks   new    marketing
   opportunities, Registrant's  research,  development  and  engineering
   expenditures  ceased  when  the   Company  exited  manufacturing   of
   products.

            Registrant owns  or is  licensed under  various patents  and
   trademarks.  Registrant does not believe that its business as a whole
   is materially dependent on  any one patent or  trademark or group  of
   patents or trademarks.

   ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

            Registrant's principal executive offices are located in  Mt.
   Prospect, Illinois.  Registrant moved its corporate headquarters from
   Rosemont, Illinois to  its current headquarters  in September,  1996,
   following the disposition of Registrant's Sheridan Systems division.

            In 1994  and 1995,  Registrant undertook  the relocation  of
   its  AM  Multigraphics  operations  from  its  700,000  square   foot
   manufacturing and office facility in Mt. Prospect to newer, more cost
   efficient facilities.   The project consisted  of three  parts:   (1)
   relocation of the business offices to  a 64,400 square foot  facility
   in Mt.  Prospect; (2)  relocation of  the  distribution center  to  a
   79,700  square foot complex in nearby Arlington Heights, Illinois  to
   enhance the Registrant's distribution capabilities; and, (3) the sale
   of its former Mount  Prospect, Illinois facility.   The Mt.  Prospect
   and Arlington Heights facilities  are leased until  2005 and are  the
   Registrant's principal facilities.


            Registrant leases  16  additional  distribution,  sales  and
   service facilities  throughout the  United States  with total  square
   footage of  94,600.   Registrant  believes  that the  properties  and
   equipment included  therein are  well maintained,  in good  operating
   condition and adequate for the current needs of its operations.

   ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
<PAGE>
             Reference is made to Item 1,  Section (a) Paragraph 2,  for
   information on Registrant's Bankruptcy Proceedings.  The commencement
   of the  Bankruptcy  Proceedings  resulted in  an  automatic  stay  of
   certain litigation against Registrant pursuant to Section 362 of  the
   Bankruptcy Code  as  of  May  17,  1993.    Therefore,  with  certain
   exceptions, all legal  proceedings against Registrant  pending as  of
   May 17,  1993,  will  be resolved  through  the  bankruptcy  process.
   Although the  vast majority  of the  claims filed  in the  Bankruptcy
   Proceedings have  been  expunged  or resolved  within  the  Company's
   reserves, a few  significant disputed  claims remain  pending in  the
   Bankruptcy Proceeding.  Registrant  believes the resolution of  these
   legal proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse  effect
   on the business or the financial position of Registrant.

             Registrant  has  been  notified  of  various  environmental
   matters in connection  with certain  current or  former locations  in
   Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.   Registrant
   believes that the legal liability relating  to such matters, if  any,
   will either be resolved consensually between Registrant and  relevant
   governmental authorities or will be subject to resolution through the
   bankruptcy  process  as  with  other  disputed  claims.    Registrant
   believes the resolution  of these matters  will not  have a  material
   adverse  effect  on  the  business  or  the  financial  position   of
   Registrant.

             Registrant is involved in various other administrative  and
   legal proceedings  incidental  to  its  business,  including  product
   liability and general liability lawsuits against which Registrant  is
   partially insured.  The resolution of these other proceedings is  not
   expected to have  a material adverse  effect on the  business or  the
   financial position of Registrant.

             VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

             None.

   ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY  AND RELATED
             STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

        (a)   Market and Other Information.

             At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 28, 1997,
   Registrant's  stockholders  approved  an  amendment  to  the   Second
   Restated Certificate  of  Incorporation to  change  the  Registrant's
   corporate name and to reduce the  authorized number of shares of  all
   classes of  capital stock  the Company  shall have  the authority  to
   issue from fifty million (50,000,000) to ten million (10,000,000), of
   which five  hundred thousand  (500,000) may  be issued  as  preferred
   shares.  Registrant's stockholders also approved an amendment to  the
   Second Restated Certificate  of Incorporation to  effect a 1 for 2 1/2
   share reverse stock split (the "Reverse  Stock Split") of the  issued
   and outstanding  shares of  the Registrant's  Common Stock,  with  an
   increase of the par value from $0.01 per share to $0.025 per share.

             Following  the  Reverse  Stock  Split  and  the  change  in
   Registrant's corporate name,  Registrant's new  Common Stock,  $0.025
   par value, commenced trading  on the American  Stock Exchange on  May
   29, 1997 under the ticker symbol "MTI."
<PAGE>

             Registrant's  Plan  of  Reorganization  provided  for   the
   amendment   and   restatement   of   Registrant's   Certificate    of
   Incorporation and  Bylaws.   The new  charter authorized  50  million
   shares of stock of which 40 million shares were reserved for issuance
   as new Common Stock and 10 million shares were reserved for  issuance
   as new Preferred Stock.  On the Effective Date of the Plan, the Board
   of Directors  authorized the  issuance of  7  million shares  of  new
   Common Stock, $0.01 par value, to holders of claims and interests  as
   described in Note 4 of  "Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements"
   contained in  the  1997  Annual Report  and  incorporated  herein  by
   reference.  On the Effective  Date, Registrant also issued  1,095,000
   new Warrants to Purchase Common Stock at an exercise price of  $18.00
   per share which expired  on October 15, 1996,  and are of no  further
   effect.

             At the Annual Meeting of  Stockholders held on December  8,
   1994, Registrant's stockholders approved the 1994 Long-Term Incentive
   Plan (the "Plan").  In conjunction therewith, an additional aggregate
   of 1,400,000 Common Stock shares were made available pursuant to  and
   in accordance with the terms of  the Plan, subject to adjustments  as
   provided in Section 6.7 of the Plan.  The shares available under  the
   Plan, as well as all awards thereunder, have been adjusted to 560,000
   common shares to reflect  the 1 for 2-1/2  share Reverse Stock  Split
   effected on May 28, 1997.

             On October 20,  1998, the Registrant's  Board of  Directors
   adopted the  1998  Stock  Incentive  Plan  for  Directors,  which  is
   intended to align the interests of the Registrant's stockholders  and
   non-employee directors  by increasing  the proprietary  interests  of
   non-employee directors in the Registrant's growth and success, and to
   enable the Company to attract and  retain non-employee directors.   A
   total of 140,000 Common Stock shares are available under the plan for
   option grants and  other stock incentives  for the Registrant's  non-
   employee directors.

             For information regarding  quarterly stock  prices for  the
   Common Stock, see  Note 14 to  the "Notes  to Consolidated  Financial
   Statements" in Registrant's 1998  Annual Report, incorporated  herein
   by reference.

        (b)  Holders.

             As of  October 21, 1998, Registrant had approximately  1000
   stockholders of record.

        (c)  Dividends.

             On May  27, 1997,  Registrant paid  a special  dividend  of
   $2.00 per share to holders of record as of   May 13, 1997.  Prior  to
   that time, Registrant had not paid cash dividends on its Common Stock
   since August  15,  1981.   Registrant's  current  Loan  and  Security
   Agreement restricts the  payment of  dividends.   See Note  3 to  the

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SCHEDULE
                                                   
   To Multigraphics, Inc.:

   We have  audited,  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  auditing
   standards,  the   consolidated  financial   statements  included   in
   Multigraphics, Inc.'s Annual Report  to Stockholders incorporated  by
   reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated
   September 25, 1998.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an
   opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in
   Part IV,  Item  14(a)(2)  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's
   management and is presented  for the purposes  of complying with  the
   Securities and Exchange  Commission's rules and  is not  part of  the
   basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to  the
   auditing procedures  applied  in the  audit  of the  basic  financial
   statements and,  in  our  opinion,  fairly  states  in  all  material
   respects the financial data required to  be set forth therein in  re-
   lation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                            MULTIGRAPHICS, INC.

                   EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

                             FISCAL YEAR 1999


   I.   PLAN OBJECTIVES

   A.   To provide competitive levels of compensation to enable
   Multigraphics, Inc. (the "Company") to attract and retain the people
   needed to successfully manage the business.

   B.   To provide a financial incentive for selected employees upon
   achievement of key performance goals, consisting both of financial
   and operating objectives set by the Compensation and Management
   Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee").

   II.  POLICY

   It is the Company's policy to pay base salaries and annual Executive
   Incentive Compensation Plan ("EICP") awards which are competitive and
   which promote the objectives set by the committee for the plan year.

   Under this policy, each participant's annual EICP award will be based
   on the degree to which the Company achieves specific financial and
   operating goals.

   III. ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

   In general, participants in the EICP are to be selected from that
   group of employees whose activities are determined by the Committee
   to have significant impact on business results and whose base
   compensation is in excess of $50,000 annually.

   Categories of participants will be established with target and
   maximum award potential as follows:

       Category       Threshold       Target         Maximum
          A                  10.0           40.0           80.0
          B                  7.5%            30%            60%
          C                 6.25%            25%            50%
          D                    5%            20%            40%
          E                 3.75%            15%            30%
          F                  2.5%            10%            20%

   IV.  PERFORMANCE GOALS

   Each participant will be measured based on the achievement of pre-
   established financial goals: profitability, cash flow and revenue
   growth; and pre-established operational objectives: identification
   and achievement of an average transaction cost index and the
   attainment of a customer satisfaction index as defined.  Goals
   (threshold, target and maximum) will be suggested by the Chief
   Executive Officer and approved by the Committee.

   Performance goals for FY99, both financial and operational, are shown
   on Attachment A.
<PAGE>
   V.   TARGET BONUS POOL

   A participant's Target Bonus equals a percentage (generally 10
   percent to 40 percent) of the base annual salary at the target level
   set by the Committee.   The Target Bonus Pool is the sum of the
   Target Bonuses for all participants.  The Target Bonus Pool is
   reached based upon satisfaction or attainment of performance goals
   set up by the Committee.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary depending
   upon the relationship of achievement of performance goals (for example,
   profitability, cash flow) to target performance.

   VI.  INDIVIDUAL AWARDS

   NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS PLAN, ALL AWARDS ARE
   DISCRETIONARY WITH THE COMMITTEE, WHETHER PERFORMANCE GOALS HAVE BEEN
   MET OR NOT.

   The payout of individual awards shall be based on the attainment of
   the performance goals set by the Committee.

   A participant's share of the Bonus Pool will be based on the category
   or target bonus set for the individual by the Committee and on
   achievement of performance goals, unless the Committee sets other
   criteria.  Actual bonus payouts will not exceed 200% of the Target
   Bonus.

   VII. DISCRETIONARY AWARDS

   An amount equal to three (3) percent of the Actual Bonus Pool may be
   made available for discretionary bonuses to non-participants in the
   Plan, but shall be subject to the approval of the Committee.

   VIII.     APPROVAL AND TIMING OF AWARD PAYMENTS

   No participant shall have any claim or right to be granted an award
   under the Plan.  The Plan may be amended by the Company at any time
   and from time to time.  Neither the Plan nor any action taken
   pursuant to the Plan shall be construed as giving to any  employee
   the right to be retained in the employ of the Company.  Except as
   otherwise provided herein, the Committee of the Company's Board of
   Directors shall have full power and authority to interpret, construe
   and administer the Plan, including the right to adjust the amount
   payable to you under any award to reflect any special circumstances
   that the Committee deems relevant or to terminate it at any time.
   All approved award payments will be made not later than ninety (90)
   days after the end of the award fiscal year, provided, however, upon
   receipt of a written request from any participant delivered before
   the end of the year, the Committee may defer payment for a period not
   to exceed one year.

   IX.  COMMUNICATION

   In order for the plan to be effective, it is essential that each
   participant have a clear understanding of how the plan operates and
   that each participant be informed of his or her inclusion shortly
   after the beginning of the plan year.

   X.   ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS AND PROCEDURES
<PAGE>
   A.   The Plan Year will be the same as the Company's fiscal year,
   i.e. August 1, 1998 through July 31, 1999.

   B.   Current Awards

   All awards will be paid in cash as soon as practical after approval
   (no later than 90 days after the end of the award fiscal year).  The
   amounts required by law to be withheld for income tax and Social
   Security taxes will be deducted from the award payments.

   C.   Eligible Participants and Salary
   The salary of each participant on September 1 of the Plan Year will
   be used as the salary of record for all calculations.  Initial
   calculations will be based upon an estimate of September 1 salaries
   for those employees who would be eligible for September increases,
   and would be finalized after the September increases have become
   effective.

   D.   Change in Status During the Year

   1.   New Hire, Transfer, Promotion

   A newly hired employee or an employee transferred or promoted during
   the Plan Year to a position qualifying for participation may receive
   a pro rata award based on the percentage of the Plan Year (actual
   months/full year times the amount granted for a full-year award for
   that position) the employee is in the participating position.

   2.   Demotion

   No award will be paid to an employee who has been demoted during the
   Plan Year to a position not eligible for participation.

   3.   Discharge

   An employee discharged during the Plan Year shall not be eligible to
   be paid for an award, even if his or her severance agreement extends
   past year-end.

   4.   Resignation

   An employee must be an active employee as of the bonus payment date
   to be eligible to be paid an award.  An employee who resigns or is
   terminated prior to the payment date will not be entitled to be paid
   for an award.

   5.   Death, Disability, Retirement, Leave of Absence

   An employee whose status as an active employee is changed during the
   Plan Year for any of the reasons cited in the heading of this section
   may, at the discretion of the Committee, be eligible to be paid for a
   pro rata award.

   E.   Miscellaneous

   1.   The Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
   modify the Plan from time to time or to terminate the Plan or to
   remove any participant from the Plan.
<PAGE>
   2.   The decision of the Committee with respect to any issues
   concerning individuals selected for award, the amount, terms, form
   and time of payment of awards and interpretation of any Plan
   guidelines or requirements shall be final and binding.

   3.   By acceptance of an award, each employee agrees that such award
   is special additional compensation and that it will not affect any
   employee benefit, e.g. life insurance, savings plan, etc. in which
   the employee participates except as provided in paragraph 4 below.

   4.   Payments of awards made under the Plan shall be included in the
   employee's compensation for purposes of the Company's retirement
   programs.

   5.   The receipt of an award shall not give an employee any right to
   continued employment and the right and power to dismiss any employee
   is specifically reserved to the Company.  The receipt of an award
   shall not entitle an employee to an award with respect to any
   subsequent Plan Year.

   6.   When a performance goal is based on income, it may be necessary
   to exclude significant non-budgeted or not-controllable gains or
   losses from actual results in order to properly measure performance.
   The Committee will decide those items that shall be considered for
   exclusion.  Examples are:

        a.   Any gains or losses which will be treated as extraordinary
   in the Company's published financial statements.

        b.   Profits or losses of companies acquired during the Plan
   Year, assuming they were not included in the budget and/or the goal.

        c.   Material gains or losses not in the budget and/or which are
   of a nonrecurring nature and are not considered to be in the ordinary
   course of business.  Some of these would be as follows:

             . Gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate
               or property.

             . Gains resulting from insurance recoveries when such
               gains relate to claims filed in previous years.

             . Losses resulting from natural catastrophes, when the
               cause of the catastrophe is beyond the control of the
               Company and did not result from any failure or
               negligence on the Company's part.

        d.   In the event of an acquisition or divestiture of a
   business, product line or other similar transaction that would affect
   the attainment of performance goals, the Committee will endeavor to
   adjust the performance goals to reflect the expected impact of the
   transaction preferably at the time the transaction is approved.

   XI.  BASIS FOR DETERMINING MEASUREMENT OF RECOMMENDED AWARDS:


   Award payouts will be determined upon attainment of performance goals
   set by the Committee, which may consist of financial and operational
   performance objectives.  Payments for the attainment of performance
   goals will be weighted at the levels set forth on the plan summary
   attached hereto.

                  of  the  Maximum  Revolving   Amount  if  such
                  termination occurs  after  November 30,  1998,
                  but on or before November 30,  1999, (c) 2% of
                  the   Maximum   Revolving   Amount   if   such
                  termination occurs after November 30, 1999 but
                  on or before November 30, 2000,  (d) 1% of the
                  Maximum Revolving  Amount if  such termination
                  occurs after November 30, 2000  but before May
                  30, 2002 and (e) if this  Agreement is renewed
                  pursuant to  Section  3.4, 1%  of  the Maximum
                  Revolving Amount if such termination occurs on
                  or after the  Renewal Date but  before May 30,
                  2003; provided,  that  if Borrowers  terminate
                  this Agreement  due to  Foothill's  refusal to

                  applicable Early Termination  Premium shall be
                  reduced by  one-half of  the  amount otherwise
                  payable hereunder."

   induce Lender to enter  into this Amendment,  each Borrower hereby
   warrants to Lender, as of the date hereof, that:

             (i)  The warranties  of each  Borrower contained  in the
        Loan Agreement, as herein amended, are true and correct as of

        therein not materially misleading.

             (iii)     No Event  of  Default  or  event  which,  with
        giving of notice or the passage of time, or both would become

                   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
             OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
       
   The following table sets forth for the years indicated certain items
   from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (expressed
   in millions of dollars). The operating results for the years ended
   July 31, 1997 and 1996 include the results of two foreign
   subsidiaries which have been divested.  The Company sold its interest
   in AM Japan Co., Ltd. in September, 1996, and on October 17, 1996,
   the Company's Canadian subsidiary filed a voluntary assignment in
   bankruptcy.

   During the fiscal year ended July 31, 1998, the Company acquired
   certain assets of Hanley Graphic Products Company and Progressive
   Lithoplate and Supply Company, both graphic arts dealers competing in
   Northern Illinois, and purchased all of the outstanding shares of
   capital stock of Akron, Ohio based Publishing Solutions Inc., a
   systems integrator.  All acquisitions have been accounted for as
   purchases and, accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial
   statements include the post-acquisition results of these operations
   since their respective acquisition dates. All per share data is
   presented on a diluted basis.

</TABLE>

   Comparison of 1998 to 1997  

   Net income in 1998 of $1.1 million ($0.37 per common share) improved
   by $1.0 million over the prior year net income of $0.1 million ($0.04
   per common share). In the prior year, the Company had a gain of $2.6
   million on the divestiture of its interest in AM Japan Co., Ltd.
   Excluding the gain on the divestiture, net income improved by $3.6
   million from the prior year. The improved result in 1998 was
   primarily due to a reduction in operating expense levels which
   resulted from the Company's elimination of unprofitable product
   lines, its exit from machine manufacturing,  efficiency improvements
   in distribution and service activities, and increased gross margins
   on higher revenue levels attributable to the acquisitions made in the
   current year.
 <PAGE>
   Revenues in 1998 of $95.3 million increased by $6.6 million over the
   prior year.  The 7% growth in revenues was largely attributable to
   the acquisitions of the three regional graphic arts dealers over the
   last eight months of the fiscal year.  The acquired businesses serve
   the same customer base as the Company.  The acquisitions complement
   the Company's internal efforts to expand its product offerings, and
   bring enhanced digital sales and support capabilities as well as an
   expanded customer base in the Company's traditional markets.  In
   addition, the Company has undertaken marketing programs focusing on
   obtaining national service accounts with manufacturers and national
   retail outlets.  Market demand for the Company's manufactured
   duplicator press products, particularly in the in-plant market
   segment, has experienced long term decline due in part to inroads
   from competing printing technologies.  As a result, the installed
   base of the Company's duplicator press equipment has declined which
   has led to decreased sales of duplicator supplies and services.
   Revenues from acquisitions, new products and increased service
   offerings collectively were more than sufficient to offset the
   decline in revenues from the prior year divestitures of operations in
   Japan and Canada, the discontinuance of unprofitable product lines,
   and the exit from manufacturing duplicator presses which,
   collectively, had contributed revenues of $7.5 million to the prior
   year.

   Gross margin of $25.2 million was $0.4 million higher than the prior
   year largely as a result of increased revenue volume.  The overall
   gross margin rate declined 1.6 percentage points to 26.4%.  The lower
   margin rate largely resulted from the shift in revenue mix from the
   Company's traditional higher margin manufactured products and service
   offerings, the demand for which has been in long term decline, to
   revenues derived from product lines added through distribution
   agreements, affiliations with third parties, and acquisitions of
   graphic arts dealers.  In anticipation of the decline in margins, the
   Company invested in information systems and instituted various
   reorganization measures which increased operational efficiency and
   lowered expense levels.

   Operating expenses decreased by $4.2 million in 1998 from 1997, after
   adjusting 1997 to exclude the $2.6 million gain from the divestiture
   of AM Japan Co. Ltd.  The decrease in expenses was largely due to the
   divestiture of foreign operations, discontinued product lines and
   elimination of costs associated with the Company's exited
   manufacturing operation which collectively added $2.4 million in the
   prior year.  The remainder of the decrease in expenses resulted from
   reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses as the
   Company transitioned to a distribution and service organization.

   Non-operating expenses increased $0.4 million in 1998, largely due to
   a $1.1 million reduction in interest income due to lower investment
   balances in 1998 following the $14.1 million dividend in May, 1997,
   offset by a $0.7 million reduction in interest expense. The decrease
   in interest expense was primarily due to lower prepetition debt
   obligations, which have been reduced by scheduled payments, and lower
   interest costs on post retirement benefit obligations.
 <PAGE>
   The Company recorded income tax expense of $0.6 million during 1998.
   Fresh start reporting rules require recognition of tax expense
   although the Company had no requirement to pay U.S. Federal taxes due
   to utilization of net operating loss carry forwards available to the
   Company.  Net income from continuing operations improved by $1.0
   million over 1997 due to the factors cited above.


   Comparison of 1997 to 1996

   Net income in 1997 of $0.1 million ($0.04 per common share) improved
   significantly over the net loss of $20.2 million from continuing
   operations in 1996.  The improved results in 1997 was primarily due
   to restructuring initiatives the Company had formulated and executed
   during 1995 and 1996.

   Declining market demand for the Company's traditional offset
   duplicator products, due to inroads by alternative technologies,
   resulted in the re-evaluation of its traditional strategy and the
   decision to exit manufacturing.  The Company's growth strategy in the
   graphic arts market is focused on expanding its product offering,
   enhancing its digital support capabilities, taking advantage of
   unique national service capabilities and increasing market
   penetration and coverage through acquisitions of regional dealers.

   Revenues in 1997 of $88.7 million decreased by $79.4 million from
   1996.  The revenue decrease was primarily the result of: 1) the
   divestitures of foreign subsidiaries in Japan and Canada which
   accounted for a revenue decline of $37.8 million, and 2) a $35.0
   million decrease due to the discontinuance of certain unprofitable
   product lines, including manufactured offset duplicator presses.

   Gross margin decreased in 1997 from 1996 due largely to the lower
   revenue level; however, the gross margin rate improved by 5.6
   percentage points over the previous year due to a more favorable
   product mix and the elimination of manufacturing overhead costs.

   Operating expenses decreased by $30.5 million in 1997 from 1996.  The
   decrease in expenses was due to: 1) a $12.0 million reduction in
   selling, general and administrative expenses which reflected improved
   efficiencies as the business transitioned to a distribution and
   service organization, and a reduction in corporate expenses; 2) the
   elimination of foreign operations, which accounted for $12.5 million
   of the reduction, including a $2.6 million gain on the divestiture of
   AM Japan Co., Ltd.; and 3) a reduction of $6.4 million in
   restructuring charges as compared with the prior year.

   Non-operating expenses decreased in 1997 by $2.6 million due to the
   elimination in 1997 of borrowings under the revolving credit
   agreement, lower interest costs on general unsecured claims, and
   interest income which was earned on divestiture proceeds received in
   1997 from the sales of the Sheridan Systems segment and the Company's
   interest in AM Japan Co., Ltd.  Net income of $0.1 million in 1997
   improved by $20.3 million over 1996 due to improved gross margin
   rates and lower expenses as described.
 <PAGE>
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (three years ended July 31, 1998)

   The Company's total cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 million as of
   July 31, 1998 decreased by $7.5 million during the fiscal year,
   following an increase in cash balances of $7.8 million in 1997, and a
   $10.0 million decrease in cash in 1996.


   Operating Activities

   In 1998, the Company had a cash outflow from operating activities of
   $2.8 million.  The 1998 cash outflow was primarily due to a $5.1
   million reduction in accrued liabilities largely from restructuring
   payments which included payments for severance, accrued vacation and
   the settlement of a lease recourse obligation from a discontinued
   business, and a $1.8 million reduction in trade payables primarily
   due to lower inventory purchases.  A $1.8 million reduction in
   inventories partially offset other outflows and was due to lower
   stocking levels of machines resulting from an increase in drop
   shipment sales, and improved supplies and parts turnover rates
   reflective of the transition from a manufacturing to a distribution
   and service operation.

   In 1997, the Company had a cash outflow from operating activities of
   $15.6 million. The 1997 cash outflow was primarily due to a $10.2
   million reduction in trade payables as extended credit terms were
   reduced with vendors, and a $14.7 million reduction in accrued
   liabilities primarily due to restructuring payments which included
   payments for severance, accrued vacation and the settlement of a
   lease obligation.  A $9.0 million reduction in accounts receivable
   partially offset other outflows and was due to improved collection
   rates, the collection of receivables from the phased out manufactured
   machine product line, and a lower revenue level.  Inventories
   increased $0.3 million in supplies and parts to improve product
   availability.

   In 1996, the Company had a cash outflow of $3.9 million, which
   improved by $1.0 million over 1995.  The net loss of $45.5 million in
   1996 was largely offset by a $26.3 million reduction in the net
   assets of discontinued operations, primarily accounts receivable and
   leases receivables, and reductions in the accounts receivable and
   inventories of the continuing business.  The inventory reduction was
   the result of the phase out of machine manufacturing and general
   reductions in stock levels due to liquidity problems.

   Depreciation and amortization remained flat from 1997 to 1998 at $1.9
   million, but 1997 decreased by $2.3 million from 1996.  In 1996 an
   additional $2.0 million was provided against certain manufacturing
   assets following the decision to phase out manufacturing. The
   Company's fixed assets consist primarily of leasehold improvements
   and computer systems.
 <PAGE>
   Investing Activities

   In 1998, the Company invested $6.9 million in the acquisitions of
   three regional graphic arts equipment and supply dealers.  In 1997,
   the Company received net proceeds of $50.6 million from the
   divestitures of Sheridan Systems and AM Japan Co., Ltd.  In 1996, the
   Company received  $6.8 million from the disposition of property,
   primarily from the sale of its Mt. Prospect, IL manufacturing and
   headquarters facility.  Capital expenditures of $0.6 million in 1998
   and $1.9 million in 1997 were made to upgrade information systems and
   customer service capabilities, and to maintain facilities.  Capital
   expenditures in 1996 of $9.0 million were primarily for leasehold
   improvements of new facilities in conjunction with the planned exit
   from the Company's manufacturing facilities, and to upgrade
   information systems equipment.

   Financing Activities

   In 1998 the Company had a net inflow of $2.8 million from financing
   activities, as compared to net outflows in 1997 and 1996 of $25.5
   million and $2.7 million, respectively.  In 1998 the Company borrowed
   $7.8 million under its revolving credit agreement to finance the
   operating and investing activities noted above.  In 1997 the Company
   repaid its outstanding balance under its revolving credit agreement
   of $5.4 million with the proceeds from divestitures.   The borrowings
   in 1996 were necessitated by operating losses.  The Company has made
   payments of $4.3 million, $5.3 million and $5.1 million in 1998, 1997
   and 1996, respectively, to resolve unsecured claims and priority tax
   claims in accordance with the Reorganization Plan of 1993.  In 1997
   the Board of Directors declared a $2.00 per share special dividend to
   holders of record as of May 13, 1997.  The dividend totaling $14.1
   million was paid on May 27, 1997.  In 1996 the Company received $4.0
   million, primarily from capital lease agreements, which was utilized
   to fund leasehold improvements and computer system upgrades.  In 1996
   discontinued operations had a $6.7 million outflow which resulted
   primarily from reductions in long term debt and capital lease
   obligations.

   The Company's primary source of financing is its revolving credit
   facility which was established in May, 1997 and which has
   subsequently been amended to provide liquidity needed to execute the
   Company's growth strategy.  The Company believes that its existing
   cash reserves and the liquidity provided by the credit facility are
   sufficient to finance current operations and support future growth
   strategies, which may include the acquisitions of other regional
   dealers or distributors in the graphic arts industry. The Company may
   also seek to increase its capital availability to expand its growth
   strategy beyond its current sources of liquidity.
 <PAGE>
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

   The Company is exposed to market risk related to change in interest
   rates.  At July 31, 1998, the Company had approximately $7.8 million
   of debt outstanding on a revolving credit facility with floating
   interest rates tied to the prime rate.  If this rate was to increase
   10 percent, the increase in interest payments would not have a
   material impact on the Company's net income or cash flows.  In
   addition, the Company has fixed rate financing arrangements under
   capital lease obligations in the amount of $1.7 million.  A 10
   percent change in interest rates would not have a material impact on
   the fair market value of this debt.

   YEAR 2000 DISCLOSURE

   The Company's information systems will require certain modifications
   to enable them to be able to process information without regard to
   whether the date occurs prior to or after the year 2000.  Currently,
   some information systems do not properly identify a year that begins
   with "20" instead of the familiar "19".   These and similar issues
   are generally referred to as "Year 2000" issues.  The Company's
   information systems are relatively new, and its recent systems
   implementation in the Fall of 1997 achieved near compliance in the
   Company's operating systems and full compliance in its host hardware.
   Based on the Company's experience in the new system implementation
   and its analysis of the work remaining, the Company anticipates that
   expenditures for modifying the systems will be approximately $0.2
   million, and the work necessary to complete all modifications will be
   complete by mid 1999.  The Company is working with its software and
   systems licensor in completing this project.  Accordingly, the
   Company does not believe that the remaining actions or the associated
   costs will be material to the Company's operating results.

   The Company has also undertaken a review of its other equipment and
   operating systems, and has begun the process of contacting its
   significant vendors and service providers to assess the possible
   impact on the Company of such third parties' failure to address Year
   2000 issues.  Although the Company cannot verify the results of its
   inquiries of third parties, it has not received any information which
   would lead it to believe that there will be material problems in
   obtaining products, supplies and services from its third party
   service providers and vendors.  Nevertheless, any significant or
   prolonged interruption in the supply of essential services or
   products could adversely effect the Company's revenues and financial
   results.  Similarly, problems with any significant portion of the
   Company's 20,000 customers in processing and paying invoices from the
   Company could result in cash flow shortages and liquidity problems.
 <PAGE>
   The Company is undertaking a number of steps to address potential
   Year 2000 problems.  The systems issues and supplier contacts
   described above are a part of those efforts.  In the event that the
   Company identifies potential problems with a service provider or
   other vendor, it will attempt to obtain services and products from
   other sources.  The Company has available to it a broad range of
   products, however, and it is unlikely that serious shortages will
   materialize.  Similarly, although the Company will have completed and
   tested its systems capabilities in advance of the year 2000, the
   Company is preparing to operate without significant portions of its
   operating and information systems.  Customer service representatives
   are trained to take orders without access to the information systems,
   purchasing representatives are trained to purchase parts without
   access to the information systems, and the Company's finance
   department is preparing to invoice and bill customers without access
   to the information systems, if necessary.  The Company is unable to
   anticipate whether significant customers or significant numbers of
   its customers will have difficulty processing and paying its
   invoices.

   statements that are not historical facts concerning, among other
   things, market conditions and the Company's strategies for growth and
   expansion.  These statements are highly dependent upon a variety of
   important factors that could cause such results or events to differ
   materially.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changing
   market conditions, the availability and cost of products, maintenance

     The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral
     part of these financial statements.

</TABLE>  
<PAGE>

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   (Dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted and per share
   amounts)

   Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

   Nature of Operations: Multigraphics, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware
   corporation, distributes an extensive range of equipment, supplies,
   and services to the graphic arts industry.  The Company has
   approximately 20,000 customers, including small and mid-size
   commercial printers, quick print franchises, in-plant print shops,
   governmental agencies, and educational institutions.  No individual
   customer accounts for more than 10% of net revenue.

   The Company's headquarters and primary operations are located in Mt.
   Prospect, Illinois.  Products are distributed throughout the United
   States utilizing eight distribution facilities.  To a lesser extent,
   products are distributed internationally through independent dealers.
   The Company employs 342 service technicians throughout the United
   States to provide technical service and training.

   Basis of Presentation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include
   the accounts of Multigraphics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
   "Company").  All significant intercompany transactions have been
   eliminated.  The Company's fiscal year end is July 31.  All
   references to years, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the fiscal
   year.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be
   consistent with current year presentation.

   Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in
   conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
   management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
   amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
   and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
   reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
   period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments
   purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
   equivalents.  It is the Company's policy to invest its excess cash in
   interest bearing deposits with major banks and institutional money
   market funds.

   Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined
   by the first-in, first out (FIFO) method, or market.

   Properties, Equipment and Depreciation: Properties and Equipment are
   stated at cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives,
   ranging from 3 to 10 years, primarily on a straight-line basis. The
   Company adjusts the net book value to recognize impairments in
   accordance with "SFAS 121: Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
   Lived Assets and Long-Lived assets to be Disposed Of."

   Goodwill: The excess purchase price over the fair market value of net
   assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill.  These amounts are
   amortized over the estimated useful lives not to exceed 40 years.
<PAGE>

   Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized from sales when a product
   is shipped.  The Company recognizes warranty and equipment
   installation expenses at the time a product is shipped, if
   applicable.  The expense is estimated considering current warranty
   policies and historical experience. Amounts billed for service
   contracts are credited to Service contract deferred income and
   recognized as revenues over the term of the contracts.

   Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided based on the liability method
   of accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
   (SFAS) No. 109, " Accounting for Income Taxes."  Deferred income
   taxes are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences of
   differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
   financial reporting amounts at each year end.

   Income per Common Share:  "Basic earnings per share" have been
   calculated based upon the weighted average number of shares actually
   outstanding, and "diluted earnings per share" have been calculated
   based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
   and other potential common shares if they were dilutive.


   Note 2 -  Acquisitions

   In December, 1997 the Company purchased all of the outstanding shares
   of Publishing Solutions Inc., and acquired the operating assets of
   Hanley Graphic Products Company.  Publishing Solutions provides its
   customers in northeast and central Ohio with equipment and systems
   integration solutions utilizing digital technologies for design, pre-
   press, imaging, and interactive media applications.  Hanley Graphic
   Products Company is a regional dealer of graphic arts equipment and
   supplies serving customers in Northern Illinois.  In June, 1998 the
   Company acquired the business and certain assets of Progressive
   Lithoplate and Supply Company, a regional graphic arts dealer serving
   customers in Northern Illinois.

   The aggregate purchase price for the three companies was $6,873
   including expenses of the transactions, and could increase by a
   maximum of $1,950, contingent upon the attainment of certain
   operating targets by the acquired companies over the next two years.
   The excess purchase price over the fair market value of net assets
   acquired amounts to a  preliminary value of $3,723, which will be
   amortized over a period not to exceed forty years.  The allocation of
   purchase price was based on preliminary estimates, and may be revised
   at a later date.

   The acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and,
   accordingly, the financial statements include results of operations
   from the date of acquisition.  The following pro forma summary
   presents the results of operations for the current and prior period
   as though the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the
   prior period.  The pro forma amounts give effect to certain
   adjustments including increased interest expense, goodwill
   amortization, estimated income tax expense as well as other factors,
   and do not necessarily reflect the results which would have occurred
   had the businesses operated as a single entity during such periods,
   nor are they necessarily indicative of results which may be obtained
   in the future.

<PAGE>
   In May, 1997 the Company entered into a $10,000 three year secured
   Revolving Credit Facility (subject to borrowing base limitations)
   with Foothill Capital Corporation ("Foothill").  The Revolving Credit
   Facility includes a $5,000 sub-facility for the issuance of letters
   of credit.  As security for utilization of the Revolving Credit
   Facility, the Company granted a security interest and general lien
   upon all of its assets.  On February 19, 1998 the Revolving Credit
   Facility was amended and restated ("the Amendment") to add the
   Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Publishing Solutions Inc., as a
   co-borrower under the Facility.  The Amendment was made, among other
   things, to allow the eligible assets of Publishing Solutions Inc. to
   be included in the Company's borrowings base and to reset the
   Company's covenant requirements in light of the acquisitions made by
   the Company during the quarter ended January 31, 1998.  On July 30,
   1998 the Revolving Credit Facility was amended further to, among
   other things, (1) grant the Company the ability to increase the
   Revolving Credit Facility limit in increments of $1,000 up to a
   maximum limit of $15,000 and, (2) extend the expiration date an
   additional two years to May 30, 2002 plus an automatic one year
   extension unless terminated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving
   Credit Facility.  On July 31, 1998, the Company increased the
   Revolving Credit Facility limit to $11,000 and the calculated
   borrowing base was approximately $11,000.  As of July 31, 1998, the
   Company had borrowings of $7,768 under the Revolving Credit Facility
   and was utilizing approximately $1,804 of the facility to secure
   outstanding letters of credit.  Interest generally will be charged at
   a spread of 1% above the reference (i.e. prime) rate of Foothill and
   can be reduced in 1/2% increments in each of the next two fiscal
   years if certain performance measures are achieved.  As of July 31,
   1998 the reference rate was 8.5%.  Letter of credit fees are 0.75%
   per annum plus issuance costs and processing fees.  The agreement
   contains restrictive covenants limiting capital expenditures,
   restricting the payment of dividends and other payments and providing
   for quarterly measures of working capital and net worth, among other
   things.  In addition, the agreement limits the Company's ability to
   borrow or to request letters of credit following a material adverse
   change as determined by Foothill.  As of July 31, 1998, the Company
   was in compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit
   Facility.

   On October 13, 1993 the Company concluded a reorganization when the
   United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed
   the Company's Plan of Reorganization (Plan).  The Plan provides that
   holders of allowed general unsecured claims receive cash payments
   toward satisfaction of the full amount of their claims in equal
   quarterly payments payable on the last business day of each calendar
   quarter ending after October 13, 1993 over a five-year period,
   together with interest at 5% per annum.  Holders of priority tax
   claims are paid 10% of the allowed claim together with accrued and
   unpaid interest at 8% per annum on the then outstanding amount on
   each anniversary of October 13, 1993 which occurs prior to the sixth
   anniversary of the date of assessment, and the
   balances of such claims along with accrued and unpaid interest on the
   sixth anniversary.  For financial reporting purposes interest on
   general unsecured claims has been imputed at 9% per annum.  At July
   31, 1998 the Company had $2,179 of restricted cash which pertains to
   the settlement of disputed claims in accordance with the Plan.

   Note 3 - Borrowing Arrangements  (Continued)

   As of July 31, 1998, aggregate maturities of total debt and
   capitalized leases, are as follows:
<TABLE>
        <S>
        Due fiscal year ending:
                  <C>                      <C>
                  1999                     $3,078
                  2000                        533
                  2001                        211

                  2003 and thereafter         145
</TABLE>
   The Revolving Credit Facility is classified as a current liability on
   the balance sheet to comply with the accounting requirements.
   However, for the aggregate debt maturities above,  the Revolving
   Credit Facility amount of $7,768 is reflected in 2002, the year the
   Revolving Credit Facility expires.

   Cash paid for interest was $1,202 during 1998, $1,647 during 1997 and
   $2,282 during fiscal 1996.


   Note 4 - Capital Structure

   On May 1, 1997 the Board of Directors declared a special dividend of
   $2.00 per common share, payable to holders of record as of May 13,
   1997.  The dividend, which totaled approximately $14,080, was
   disbursed on May 27, 1997.

   On May 28, 1997 the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the
   Company's Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation: (1)
   decreasing the authorized number of shares of capital stock from
   50,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares with 9,500,000 shares being
   reserved for issuance as Common Stock and 500,000 shares being
   reserved for issuance as Preferred Stock, (2) changing the name of
   the Company to Multigraphics, Inc., and (3) effecting a 1 for 2 1/2
   share reverse stock split thereby decreasing the number of issued and
   outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock to 2,815,337
   (without giving effect to elimination of fractional shares) and
   increasing the par value of each Common share from $.01 to $.025 per
   share.  The Company has not issued any Preferred Stock.  The Common
   Stock is not subject to conversion or redemption and when issued is
   fully paid and non-assessable and has no preemptive rights.  All
   references in the accompanying financial statements to the number of
   common shares and per-share amounts have been restated to reflect the
   reverse stock split and change in par value.

<PAGE>
   Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies

   The Company received creditor claims during its bankruptcy
   proceedings which the Company believes are duplicative, erroneous or
   exaggerated and to which the Company believes it has valid defenses.
   The Company has filed objections to these disputed claims in the
   United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  As of July 31, 1998 and
   July 31, 1997, disputed claims amounted to $5,205 and $8,205,
   respectively.  The disputed claims are primarily comprised of
   environmental and product liability claims.  Although the vast
   majority of the claims filed in the bankruptcy proceedings have been
   expunged or resolved within the Company's reserves, a few significant
   disputed claims remain pending in the bankruptcy proceeding.

   The Company has been notified of various environmental matters in
   connection with certain current or former Company locations in
   Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  The Company
   is also involved in various other administrative and legal
   proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability
   and general liability lawsuits against which the Company is partially
   insured.

   The disputed claims in the bankruptcy proceedings and the other legal
   proceedings are in many cases in excess of recorded reserves.  At the
   present time, it is management's opinion, based on information
   available to the Company and management's experience in such matters,
   that the resolution of these legal proceedings is not expected to
   have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition,
   results of operations or liquidity.



   Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

   The Company has sold certain receivables related to machine sales,

   believes unreserved exposures pertaining to these contingencies will
   not materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of

   The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109.  At July 31, 1998 and
   July 31, 1997 the approximate amounts of deferred tax assets and
   deferred tax liabilities resulting from temporary differences and
   carryforwards were as follows:

</TABLE>


   The Sec. 382 ownership change which resulted from the 1993 bankruptcy
   reorganization imposed a limitation on the usage of pre-
   reorganization domestic tax operating loss carryforwards.  Usage of
   this loss carryforward is limited to $3,689 per year or $55,335 for a
   period of 15 years following the ownership change.  In addition, as
   of July 31, 1998, the Company had domestic tax loss carryforwards of
   approximately $158,000 attributable to post-reorganization periods
   and therefore not subject to limitation.  The domestic tax loss
   carryforwards will expire from 1999 to 2013.  The AMT credit,
   although subject to the Sec. 382 limitation, has no expiration date.

   During 1998, the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance
   decreased by $1,800 primarily due to decreases in the Company's
   reserve balances.  Due to the uncertainty as to the realizability of
   the deferred tax assets, the Company has established valuation
   allowances in accordance with SFAS No. 109 to offset the asset.

   To the extent the Company realizes a tax benefit as a result of
   future reductions in the valuation allowance related to the
   utilization of pre-reorganization deferred tax assets, fresh start
   accounting rules provide for the reporting of such benefit by
   increasing Capital in excess of par value.  Although the future
   recognition of this benefit will have no impact on net earnings, the
   Company will realize a cash benefit from utilization of the "Pre-
   Reorganization Benefits" against any future tax liabilities.

   Note 7 - Deferred Compensation

   Restated for the reverse stock split discussed in Note 4, as of July
   31, 1998, the Company's 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan provides for
   the issuance of 560,000 shares of $.025 par value Common Stock.
   Options to purchase the Common Stock are awarded at a price not less
   than 100% of the market price on the date of grant, become
   exercisable at various dates generally from one to four years after
   the date of grant, and expire ten years after the date of grant.  In
   the event a holder of options is no longer employed by the Company,
   the unvested shares are canceled upon the employee's termination and
   any vested shares must be exercised within 90 days or they are also
   canceled

   As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
   123 ("SFAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the
   Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
   25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), in
   accounting for stock-based awards to employees.  Under APB No. 25,
   because the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options
   equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
   no compensation expense is recognized in the Company's financial
   statements for all periods presented.

   Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
   required by SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be
   determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
   options granted subsequent to July 31, 1995 under the fair value
   method of that statement. The fair value of options granted in fiscal
   years 1998, 1997 and 1996 reported below has been estimated at the
   date of grant using the following weighted average assumptions:
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
   <S>                           <C>      <C>      <C>
                                 1998     1997     1996
   Risk-free rate (%)            5.90     5.85     5.96
   Volatility  (%)               33.0     25.0     30.0
   Expected Life (in years)      5        5        5
   Dividend Yield                ---      ---      ---
</TABLE>
   Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
   assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
   the Company's options have characteristics significantly different
   from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
   input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
   the opinion of management, the existing models do not necessarily
   provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its options.
   The weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted
   through July 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $1.55, $1.72 and $2.38 per
   share, respectively.

   Note 7 - Deferred Compensation (continued)

   For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of
   the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period.
   The Company's pro forma net income and per share data from continuing
   operations is as follows:

<TABLE>
   <S>                             <C>       <C>      <C>
                                    1998      1997     1996
   Pro Forma Net Income (loss):    $1,029    $   94   $ (20,159)

   Pro Forma Per Share Data:
                     Basic         $  .36    $  .03   $   (7.19)
                     Diluted       $  .36    $  .03   $   (7.19)
</TABLE>

   Because the Company anticipates making additional grants and options
   vest over several years, the effects on pro forma disclosures of
   applying SFAS No. 123 are not likely to be representative of the
   effects on pro forma disclosures of future years. SFAS No. 123 is
   applicable only to options granted subsequent to July 31, 1995.


   Note 8 - Unusual Items

   On September 20, 1996, the Company completed the sale of its
   2,148,000 shares of AM Japan Co., Ltd. ("AM Japan") and received
   proceeds of approximately $10,600, net of certain costs.  A gain of
   approximately $2,600 was recorded by the Company in the quarter ended
   November 2, 1996, after providing for expenses related to the sale.

   On October 17, 1996, the Company's Canadian subsidiary filed for
   voluntary assignment in bankruptcy.  Reserves for the cost to exit
   Canada, which had been established in the fiscal year ended July 31,
   1996, were adequate and no additional costs were recognized.
<PAGE>
   On December 2, 1996, the Company and Xeikon, N.V. entered into an
   agreement under which the parties agreed not to renew the
   distribution agreement.  The distribution agreement provided for the
   Company to sell and service Xeikon digital color presses in North
   America.  As part of this agreement, Xeikon America, Inc. has
   acquired certain assets from the Company and assumed certain
   responsibilities of the Company.  The divestiture of the assets
   resulted in a net loss of approximately $500 which the Company
   recorded in the quarter ending November 2, 1996.

   During 1996, the Company had provided $7,032 to cover certain
   restructuring actions to be carried out in 1997.  These restructuring
   actions consisted of: 1) $2,845 of severance and benefits associated
   with the termination of seven employees, including three officers, in
   conjunction with approved plans to close the corporate office and
   consolidate certain functions of the Company, 2) $3,561 to write-off
   net assets of the Company's Canadian subsidiary in connection with
   plans to exit this operation, and 3) $626 of facility closure,
   equipment disposal, and severance costs associated with management's
   plans to exit its manufacturing business.  These actions were
   substantially concluded in 1997.

   In August 1996, the Company completed the sale of substantially all
   of the assets and liabilities of the Sheridan Systems division for
   proceeds of $50,100.  A loss of $15,212 was recorded in the fourth
   quarter of the Company's fiscal year ended July 31, 1996 as a result
   of the transaction, with no recorded tax benefit.

   During fiscal year 1996 the Company completed the exit of its
   Multigraphics - International subsidiaries with the sale of its
   subsidiaries in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium and the
   placement of the Company's Multigraphics UK holding company into an
   Administration Proceeding.  The sale of the subsidiaries in the
   Netherlands, France, and Belgium required the Company to provide
   consideration of approximately $3,000 in the form of cash and other
   assets.  No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the exit of the
   Multigraphics - International subsidiaries.   The results of operations
   of Sheridan Systems and the divested Multigraphics - International
   operations are presented in the consolidated financial statements
   as discontinued operations. Interest expense pertaining to the
   Company's Revolving Credit Facility has been allocated based upon
   the ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations to the
   consolidated capitalization of the Company.  Continuing operations
   and discontinued operations reflect the net tax benefit or tax
   expense generated by the respective operations, limited, however,
   by the income tax benefit or tax expense recognized in the Company's
   historical financial statements. No general corporate expenses have
   been allocated to the discontinued operations.  The results of the
   discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results
   of operations which may have been obtained had the continuing and
   discontinued operations been operating independently.

   Note 11 - Retirement Benefit Plans

   The Company maintains defined contribution retirement plans for
   domestic employees comprised of a savings plan (401(k)) and a profit
   sharing plan (Retirement Accumulation Plan).  Contributions to these
   plans take the form of (i) Company contributions to match a portion
   of employee contribution and (ii) contributions made at the
   discretion of the Board of Directors.  The Company's contributions to
   the domestic defined contribution plans were $800, $911 and $1,317 in
   1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively.

   In addition, the Company provides limited life insurance and health
   care benefits to certain domestic retired employees and provides for
   certain medical and life insurance benefits for retirees of
   previously closed manufacturing locations.

   Assumptions used for the Company's retiree life and health care plans
   as of July 31, were as follows:

                                           1998       1997
   Discount rate for determining
   obligations and interest cost           7.25%      7.25%
</TABLE>

   If the health care cost trend rates were increased 1% for all future
   years, the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation would have
   increased 2.9% at July 31, 1998.  The effect of this change on the
   aggregate of service and interest costs would have been an increase
   of 2.6% for 1998.  An 11% increase in the health care cost trend rate
   was assumed for retirees under age 65 and an 9.0% increase for those
   over the age of 65.  These rates are assumed to decrease gradually to
   5.5% in the year 2001.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


   To the Shareholders and the
   Board of Directors of
   Multigraphics, Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
   Multigraphics, Inc. as of July 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
   consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
   flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 1998.
   These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
   management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
   financial statements based on our audit.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
   auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
   the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
   statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
   examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
   disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
   assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
   made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
   statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
   reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
   fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
   Multigraphics, Inc. as of July 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
   its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the
   period ended July 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
   accounting principles.

   To Multigraphics, Inc.:

   We have  audited,  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  auditing
   standards,  the   consolidated  financial   statements  included   in
   Multigraphics, Inc.'s Annual Report  to Stockholders incorporated  by
   reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated

   opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in
   Part IV,  Item  14(a)(2)  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's
   management and is presented  for the purposes  of complying with  the
   Securities and Exchange  Commission's rules and  is not  part of  the
   basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to  the
   auditing procedures  applied  in the  audit  of the  basic  financial
   statements and,  in  our  opinion,  fairly  states  in  all  material
   respects the financial data required to  be set forth therein in  re-
   lation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
