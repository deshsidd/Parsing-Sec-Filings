                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGE AND EMPLOYEE DATA)
 
    AAR  CORP. and its  subsidiaries are referred to  herein collectively as the
"Company," unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company was organized  in
1955  as the successor to  a business founded in  1951 and was reincorporated in
Delaware in 1966. The  Company supplies a variety  of products and services  for
aviation in the United States and abroad.
 
    Certain  of  the  Company's  aviation-related  activities  and  products are
subject to  licensing,  certification  and other  requirements  imposed  by  the
Federal Aviation Administration and other regulatory agencies, both domestic and
foreign.  The Company believes that it  has all licenses and certifications that
are material to the conduct of its business.
 
    The Company's trading activities include the  purchase, sale and lease of  a
wide variety of new, used and overhauled aviation products, principally aircraft
equipment  such as engines, avionics, accessories, airframe and engine parts and
components. The Company also provides customized inventory supply and management
programs  for  certain  aircraft  and  engine  parts  in  support  of   customer
maintenance  activities.  The  Company is  also  a distributor  of  new aviation
hardware and  parts. The  Company's  primary sources  of aviation  products  are
domestic  and  foreign  airlines,  independent  aviation  service  companies and
airframe, engine  and  other  original equipment  manufacturers.  The  Company's
trading activities also include the purchase, sale, lease and lease financing of
new and used jet aircraft.
 
    The Company provides a wide range of services, parts, component exchange and
other  products  as  part of  its  overhaul activities.  The  Company overhauls,
repairs and modifies components for commercial and military aircraft,  including
landing  gear and engine  components for most models  of commercial aircraft. It
provides aircraft terminal services (fueling and aircraft storage), maintenance,
modification,  special  equipment   installation  and   painting  services   for
commercial and business aircraft.
 
    The   Company  manufactures,  installs   and  repairs  specialized  aviation
products, including pallets, containers, cargo handling systems and  lightweight
air   logistics   shelters,  primarily   for   domestic  and   foreign  military
organizations, airframe manufacturers, commercial airlines and others.
 
    The Company furnishes aviation services directly through its own  employees.
Domestic  and  foreign  airlines,  aviation  original  equipment  manufacturers,
aircraft leasing  companies, domestic  and  foreign military  organizations  and
independent  aviation  support companies  are  the principal  customers  for the
Company's aviation  trading activities.  Principal  customers of  the  Company's
aviation   overhaul  activities   are  commercial   airlines,  aircraft  leasing
companies, business  aircraft  operators,  military  overhaul  depots,  military
contractors  and original equipment manufacturers. Sales of aviation services to
commercial airlines are generally affected by  such factors as the number,  type
and  average  age of  aircraft in  service, the  levels of  aircraft utilization
(E.G., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators and the level of
sales of new and used aircraft.
 
    The Company is a  leading independent supplier of  aviation services to  the
highly  competitive  worldwide  aviation aftermarket.  Competition  is  based on
quality, ability to  provide a broad  range of products  and services, speed  of
delivery  and price. During the past three  years, there has been an increase in
demand for  aviation  aftermarket  products  and  services.  Previously,  global
commercial  aviation had  experienced significant financial  losses from reduced
traffic demands and  increased costs. Airlines  curtailed purchases and  reduced
or,  in  some cases,  ceased  operations, leading  to  a decline  in  demand for
aviation aftermarket products and services during the early 1990s. This  decline
in  demand was exacerbated by the  availability of parts from grounded aircraft,
excess airline inventories and material from airlines that ceased operations.
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
    Demand improved during  this three-year  period as  many airlines  worldwide
experienced  increased revenue  passenger and freight  miles, increased aircraft
fleet utilization, improved financial stability and, in some cases, infusions of
new capital  or financial  restructurings. During  this period  of  improvement,
start-up  airlines emerged in niche markets, recorded operating earnings and, in
some instances, expanded operations. The improvement in the operating results of
many airlines  worldwide  stem from  increased  traffic demands,  internal  cost
controls   and  from  outsourcing  certain  support  activities  to  third-party
providers to achieve greater operational efficiencies. Additionally, the  supply
of  surplus aircraft  and parts inventories  that increased  during the industry
downturn in  the early  1990s has  been absorbed  at a  faster rate  due to  the
increased   utilization  by  air  carriers  worldwide  of  aircraft  fleets  and
conversion of aircraft  from passenger  to the  more rapidly  growing cargo  and
small package delivery market.
 
    Aerospace and defense manufacturers also experienced lower demand during the
beginning  of this three-year period as orders  for new aircraft were reduced or
canceled. While manufacturers' orderbooks have not yet achieved the level of new
aircraft orders experienced in the late 1980s, increased orders for new aircraft
have been  received from  a growing  number of  aircraft leasing  companies  and
airlines  worldwide. Certain manufacturers have  responded to these increases by
announcing expanded production of  aircraft. Also during  the beginning of  this
period, government budget cuts resulted in a downsizing and restructuring of the
United  States military.  While this  adversely affected  the aerospace/aviation
industry, the military continued  to require products  to support ongoing  rapid
deployment requirements and services previously performed within the military to
meet their strategic objectives.
 
    The  Company competes with independent aviation aftermarket distributors and
support  facilities,  as  well  as  airlines  and  aerospace/aviation   original
equipment  manufacturers. In certain of its  leasing and commercial jet aircraft
trading activities, the Company  faces competition from financial  institutions,
syndicators,  commercial and  specialized leasing  companies and  other entities
that provide financing. The  Company believes it  has maintained a  satisfactory
competitive position and a strong financial base.
 
    In  addition to  its aviation-related  activities, the  Company manufactures
highly engineered  proprietary  products, including  industrial  floor  cleaning
machines  and  nuclear  shielding  material. The  Company  sells  these products
directly and through independent  distributors to a  wide variety of  commercial
customers  and domestic and foreign governments.  The markets for these products
are highly competitive, based on price, quality and availability.
 
    At May  31, 1996,  backlog believed  to be  firm was  approximately  $86,061
compared  to  $79,407  at  May  31,  1995.  An  additional  $55,463  of unfunded
government options on  awarded contracts also  existed at May  31, 1996. Of  the
1996  year-end backlog  that is firm,  $17,339 is attributable  to contracts for
products with the U.S. Government. It is expected that approximately $82,833  of
the backlog will be shipped in fiscal 1997.
 
    Sales to the United States Government, its agencies and its contractors were
approximately  $92,362 (18.3% of  total net sales), $82,708  (18.3% of total net
sales) and $77,500 (19.0%  of total net  sales) in fiscal  years 1996, 1995  and
1994,  respectively. Because such  sales are subject  to competitive bidding and
government funding, no assurance can be  given that such sales will continue  at
levels   previously  experienced.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  government
contracts are  for  aviation products  and  services used  for  ongoing  routine
military   logistic  support  activities;  unlike   weapons  systems  and  other
high-technology military  requirements, these  products  and services  are  less
likely to be affected by reductions in defense spending. The Company's contracts
with the United States Government and its agencies are typically firm agreements
to  provide aviation products and  services at a fixed price  and have a term of
one year or  less, frequently subject  to extension for  one or more  additional
periods  of  one year  at  the option  of  the government  agency.  Although the
Company's   government   contracts   are   subject   to   termination   at   the
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
election of the government, in the event of such a termination the Company would
be  entitled to recover from the government  all allowable costs incurred by the
Company through the date of termination.
 
    At May 31, 1996, the Company employed approximately 2,140 persons worldwide.
 
    For  information  concerning  the  Company's  Business  Segment  activities,
including  classes of similar  products and services,  see Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations."  For
information  concerning export sales, see "Business Segment Information" in Note
9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
    Aviation trading activities are conducted from three buildings in Elk  Grove
Village, Illinois, two owned by the Company and the third is leased. In addition
to  warehouse space,  which is  mechanized for  efficient access  to the diverse
inventory, these  facilities  include executive  offices,  sales offices  and  a
service  center.  Warehouse facilities  are leased  in Cerritos,  California and
Hawthorne, New York  for the purpose  of aviation hardware  distribution and  in
Hamburg  and Hannover, Germany  and Nantgarw, Wales for  the purpose of aviation
parts distribution.
 
    Aviation overhaul facilities  are located in  The Netherlands near  Schiphol
International  Airport (in  a building owned  by the Company);  Garden City, New
York (in a building owned  by the Company); Frankfort,  New York (subject to  an
industrial  revenue bond  lease to  the Company  until 2001,  at which  time the
Company expects to purchase the facility for a nominal consideration);  Windsor,
Connecticut  (in a  building owned  by the  Company); Miami,  Florida (in leased
facilities near the airport); Singapore (in leased facilities near the airport);
London,  England  (in  leased  facilities)  and  Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma   (in
facilities  leased from airport authorities). The Company's experience indicates
that lease renewal is available on reasonable terms consistent with its business
needs.
 
    The Company's  principal manufacturing  activities  are conducted  at  owned
facilities  in Port Jervis, New  York, and Cadillac and  Livonia, Michigan and a
plant located  in Aberdeen,  North Carolina  (subject to  an expired  industrial
revenue bond lease to the Company which provided for the Company to purchase the
facility for a nominal consideration).
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    A  subsidiary  of  the  Company has  negotiated  a  settlement  in principle
resolving  an  enforcement  action  brought  on  behalf  of  the  United  States
Environmental  Protection  Agency ("EPA")  in the  U.S.  District Court  for the
Western District of Michigan in January, 1996, alleging violations of the  Clean
Air  Act relating to exceeding volatile  organic compound emission rates under a
permit issued to the subsidiary by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
The EPA had previously issued a Notice of Proposed Civil Penalty for the alleged
violations in the amount of $600,000.  The settlement provides for dismissal  of
the  alleged violations without admission of wrong  doing and for the payment of
approximately $200,000 by the subsidiary.
 
    Except as otherwise set forth in this Item  3 the Company is not a party  to
any pending material, governmental or environmental legal proceedings other than
routine litigation incidental to its business.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
        STOCKHOLDER MATTERS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE, PERCENTAGE DATA AND
        NUMBER OF STOCKHOLDERS)
 
    The Company's Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and  the
Chicago  Stock  Exchange.  On June  30,  1996, there  were  approximately 11,500
holders of the Common Stock of  the Company, including participants in  security
position listings.
 
    Certain  of the Company's debt agreements contain provisions restricting the
payment of  dividends or  repurchase  of its  shares. See  Note  2 of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Under the most restrictive of
these provisions, the Company may not pay dividends (other than stock dividends)
or  acquire  its capital  stock  if after  giving  effect thereto  the aggregate
amounts paid on or after  June 1, 1995 exceed the  sum of (i) $25,000 plus  (ii)

THREE-YEAR NET SALES SUMMARY
 
    The comparison of net sales of the Company over the last three fiscal  years
covers  a period of relatively strong  general economic conditions and improving
conditions in  the aerospace/aviation  industry.  Airlines continue  to  improve
their  overall financial condition which was  weakened due to an extended period
of operating  losses during  the early  1990s. Airlines  continue to  experience
increased fleet utilization and higher revenue passenger and freight miles which
are  contributing to  improved operating earnings.  Airlines' operating earnings
are also being positively  affected by their  aggressive initiatives to  control
costs  through  restructuring  operations, exiting  unprofitable  routes  and by
outsourcing certain support activities to outside providers. Start-up  airlines,
which  emerged  in  niche  markets  during the  beginning  of  this  period, are
recording higher  operating  earnings  and, in  many  instances,  are  expanding
operations.  Supplies of surplus  aircraft and parts  inventories that increased
during the industry  downturn in the  early 1990s  are now being  absorbed at  a
faster  rate due to increased aircraft utilization and conversion of aircraft to
alternate uses, such as cargo capabilities.
 
    In  fiscal  1996  and  1995,  the  Company's  revenues  benefited  from  the
aggressive  pursuit of market opportunities  in the improving aerospace/aviation
industry. The  Company's trading  sales of  airframe and  large component  parts
increased,  as  did  sales  from  inventory  management  programs  and inventory
provisioning for  air carriers.  Sales of  certain airframe  and large  airframe
component  overhaul services,  as well  as commercial  cargo systems,  were also
higher in fiscal 1996 and 1995.
 
    The U.S. military  continues to downsize  as a result  of government  budget
cuts.  While this downsizing adversely  affected the aerospace/aviation industry
generally, the military continues to  require products to support ongoing  rapid
deployment  requirements and services previously  performed within the military.
The Company's  response to  these changes  has resulted  in increased  sales  of
manufactured  products. The Company's sales  of overhaul services also benefited
from government outsourcing  of certain activities  previously performed  within
the  military.  Sales  of the  Company's  floor maintenance  products  were also
higher, reflecting the Company's aggressive pursuit of business opportunities in
the marketplace.
 
    The Company believes that  its established market  position, its ability  to
respond  to changes in the  industry and its diverse  customer base coupled with
continued improvement in the aerospace/aviation industry, positions the  Company
to take advantage of opportunities in improving markets.

FISCAL 1996 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1995
 
    The  Company's operating results  continued to improve in  fiscal 1996 as it
took  advantage   of   business   opportunities  available   in   the   improved
aerospace/aviation  marketplace  and  as  the  Company  successfully implemented
certain strategic marketing initiatives. Consolidated net sales for fiscal  1996
increased  $53,595 or 11.9%  over the prior  fiscal year due  to increased sales
across all  classes of  similar products  and services.  Consolidated  operating
income  increased  $8,004  or  32.8%  over  the  prior  year  due  to  increased
consolidated net sales and a  higher consolidated gross profit margin  partially
offset  by  increased  selling,  general and  administrative  costs.  Net income
increased $5,549  or  53%  over  the  prior  year  primarily  due  to  increased
consolidated net sales and gross profit margin.
 
    Trading  sales increased $22,979 or 9.7% over  the prior year as a result of
increased sales of aircraft, airframe and large component parts, which  included
sales  from  inventory management  programs and  inventory provisioning  for air
carriers. Overhaul sales  increased $24,850 or  22.9% primarily as  a result  of
airframe  and large airframe component  overhaul services, supplemented by other
airframe component overhaul  services. Manufacturing sales  increased $5,766  or
5.4%  over  the prior  year primarily  due  to increased  sales of  products and
product repair services supporting rapid deployment requirements, aircraft cargo
systems and floor maintenance equipment, partially offset by a decline from  the
disposition of small manufactured product lines since the prior-year period.
 
    Consolidated  gross profit increased $12,894 or  16.6% over the prior fiscal
year due to increased consolidated net sales and an improved gross profit margin
of 18.0% versus the prior year's  17.3% margin. The margin on principal  trading
and  overhaul products and services improved over  the prior year as a result of
favorable product mix and improved pricing of certain products and services. The
margin on manufactured  products declined  slightly as a  result of  the mix  of
products  and product  repair services supporting  rapid deployment requirements
partially offset by aircraft cargo systems and floor maintenance equipment.
 
    Consolidated operating income increased $8,004 or 32.8% over the prior  year
as  a  result  of  increased  consolidated net  sales  and  gross  profit margin
partially offset by increased total  selling, general and administrative  costs.
While  selling, general  and administrative  costs declined  as a  percentage of
sales, the total costs increased  over the prior year  as a result of  increased
personnel  costs,  increased marketing  support  programs and  costs  to enhance
information technology systems.
 
    Consolidated net income increased $5,549 or 53.0% over the prior fiscal year
primarily as  a result  of the  increased consolidated  net sales  and  improved
consolidated  gross profit margin.  Net income also increased  by a reduction in
interest expense resulting from substantially lower short-term borrowings during
the current year partially offset by  a small increase in the Company's  current
year effective tax rate.
 
FISCAL 1995 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1994
 
    The Company's operating results continued to improve in fiscal 1995 building
on  improvements  in the  prior  year. Consolidated  net  sales for  fiscal 1995
increased $43,641 or 10.7% over the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased
sales of  major products  within each  of the  classes of  similar products  and
services.  Operating income increased $2,614 or 11.9% over the prior year due to
increased  consolidated  net  sales  partially   offset  by  a  slightly   lower
consolidated  gross  profit  margin  and increased  total  selling,  general and
administrative costs.  Net  income increased  $969  or 10.2%  primarily  due  to
increased consolidated net sales partially offset by the factors described above
and  increased  interest expense  on additional  borrowings and  higher interest
rates, primarily resulting from the sale of  $50,000 of 10 year, 7.25% notes  in
October 1993.
 
    Trading  sales increased $28,162 or 13.5% primarily as a result of increased
sales of airframe  and large  component parts as  well as  sales resulting  from
inventory  management programs and inventory  provisioning of start-up airlines.
Overhaul sales increased $5,765 or 5.6% primarily as
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
a  result  of  increased  airframe  and  airframe  component  overhaul  services
partially  offset  by  reduced  sales  of  large  component  overhaul  services.
Manufacturing sales  increased $9,714  or 10.1%  primarily due  to the  sale  of
manufactured  commercial cargo systems, products  and product repairs supporting
the United States  Government's rapid deployment  program and floor  maintenance
products.
 
    Consolidated  gross profit  increased $5,961 or  8.3% over  the prior fiscal
year due to increased  consolidated net sales,  although the consolidated  gross
profit  margin  of 17.3%  was lower  than  the prior  year's 17.6%  gross profit
margin. However, the  prior fiscal year  included $700 from  a reduction in  the
interest  rate  on  a nonrecourse  leveraged  lease obligation  and  $1,300 from
leveraged lease repricing  required to  adjust for tax  rate differentials.  The
margin  on manufactured products  and principal trading  products increased year
over year. Overhaul margins declined over  the prior year primarily as a  result
of  changes in  the mix  of labor  and parts  provided in  overhaul services and
highly competitive pricing on overhaul business.
 
    Consolidated operating income increased $2,614 or 11.9% over the prior  year
due  to increased  consolidated net sales  partially offset  by the consolidated
margin decline described above and increased selling, general and administrative
costs which declined as a percentage of net sales.
 
    Consolidated net income increased $969 or  10.2% over the prior year due  to
the  increased consolidated net sales partially  offset by the factors described
above and increased interest expense.
 
FISCAL 1994
 
    The Company's operating results improved  in fiscal 1994 despite the  highly
competitive  and economically  weak aerospace/aviation  market. Consolidated net
sales for  fiscal 1994  increased $24,974  or 6.5%  over the  prior fiscal  year
primarily  as a result of increased manufacturing and overhaul sales. Net income
increased $9,211 over the  prior year which  included restructuring expenses  of
$11,000  ($7,200 after  tax) related  to the  writedown of  certain inventories.
Excluding restructuring expenses, net  income increased $2,011  or 26.9% as  the
result of sales increases and reduced selling, general and administrative costs.
 
    Manufacturing  sales increased $18,287 or 23.5%,  primarily from the sale of
products to the U.S. Government. Overhaul  sales increased $10,082 or 10.9%  due
to  increased demand for maintenance services  at the Oklahoma City facility and
increased sales of rotable  landing gear inventory.  Trading sales increased  in
its  primary products, such  as airframe and engine  parts; however, these gains
were offset by reduced demand for aviation fasteners and the Company's  decision
not  to enter into fastener  programs requiring significant inventory investment
with uncertain returns. These factors resulted in an overall decline in  trading
sales of $3,395 or 1.6%.
 
    Consolidated  gross  profit increased  $3,474 or  5.1%  over the  prior year
primarily due to  increased consolidated sales.  Fiscal 1994 consolidated  gross
profit  included $700  from a  reduction in the  interest rate  on a nonrecourse
leveraged lease obligation negotiated by the Company, and $1,300 from  leveraged
lease  repricing required to adjust for tax rate differentials. The consolidated
gross profit margin was slightly lower than  the prior year, down from 17.9%  to
17.6%.  Trading and manufacturing margins improved year over year while overhaul
margins declined.  The  overhaul  margin  decline was  due  to  increased  price
competition resulting from maintenance overcapacity in the industry and airlines
using  lower-cost serviceable  replacement components in  preference to overhaul
services.
 
    Consolidated operating income increased $16,481 over the prior year. Without
the fiscal 1993  restructuring expenses of  $11,000, operating income  increased
$5,481  or 33.5% due primarily to the  increased sales and a reduction of $2,007
in selling, general and administative  costs. The Company maintained its  effort
to contain costs, reduce nonessential spending and create operating efficiencies
wherever possible.

    Consolidated  net income increased $9,211 notwithstanding increased interest
expense of $1,457 due to higher fixed-rate interest on debt from the issuance of
$50,000 of new 7.25% long-term notes issued in October, 1993. Proceeds from this
fixed-rate debt repaid $28,000 of  short-term bank borrowings at lower  interest
rates. Higher margins on fiscal 1994 export sales reduced the effective tax rate
which also contributed to the net income increase.
 
                              FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
AT MAY 31, 1996 COMPARED WITH MAY 31, 1995
 
    In  fiscal 1996 the Company generated  $24,760 of cash from operations. This
represents a $9,505 or 62.3% increase in cash generated from operations over the
prior year. The increase was generated primarily through increased earnings  and
working  capital management. The  Company's cash and  cash equivalents increased
$11,119 or 49.4% over the prior year after making capital expenditures of $7,547
and paying dividends of $7,676 during fiscal 1996.
 
    The Company further strengthened its  financial position during fiscal  1996
by   generating  additional  working  capital   of  $10,135,  utilizing  minimal
short-term borrowings  during  the  year  and reducing  its  long-term  debt  to
capitalization  ratio to 36.6%. The Company  continues to maintain its available
external sources of financing from $132,977 of unused available bank lines and a
shelf registration  on file  with  the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  for
$85,000  of  medium or  long-term  debt securities  which  it may  issue  at its
discretion subject to market conditions. Subsequent to the fiscal 1996 year  end
the Company acquired a new headquarters and operating facility for $11,650. This
facility  will consolidate and replace  certain facilities currently operated by
the Company and will be financed with either internally generated funds,  credit
sources  currently in place  or credit sources  obtained for the  purpose of the
acquisition. If  credit  sources  are  used  to  finance  the  new  facility,  a
significant  portion  would  be repaid  from  proceeds  of the  sale  of vacated
facilities and any balance remaining  would be repaid from internally  generated
funds.
 
    The  Company  believes  that its  cash  and cash  equivalents  and available
sources of financing will continue to give  the Company the ability to meet  its
ongoing  working  capital requirements,  make anticipated  capital expenditures,
meet contractual  commitments,  pay  dividends, and  pursue  favorable  business
opportunities.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
 
                              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
  OF AAR CORP.:
 
    We  have audited the  accompanying consolidated balance  sheets of AAR CORP.
and subsidiaries  as of  May 31,  1996 and  1995, and  the related  consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in  the  three-year  period ended  May  31, 1996.  These  consolidated financial
statements  are   the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.
 
    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our  opinion, the  consolidated financial  statements referred  to  above
present  fairly, in all  material respects, the financial  position of AAR CORP.
and subsidiaries  as  of  May 31,  1996  and  1995, and  the  results  of  their
operations  and their cash flows for each  of the years in the three-year period
ended May 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
    As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the  Financial Accounting Standards Board's  Statement
of  Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other  Than
Pensions" as of June 1, 1993.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
    AAR   CORP.   supplies  a   variety  of   products   and  services   to  the
aerospace/aviation industry  in  the  United States  and  abroad.  Products  and
services  are  sold  primarily  to  commercial  domestic  and  foreign airlines,
business aircraft operators, aviation original equipment manufacturers, aircraft
leasing companies, domestic and  foreign military organizations and  independent
aviation support companies.
 
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
    The  accompanying consolidated financial statements  include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts  and
transactions.
 
  REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
    Sales  and related cost  of sales are recognized  primarily upon shipment of
products and  performance  of services.  Sales  and  related cost  of  sales  on
long-term  contracts are  recognized as units  are delivered,  determined by the
percentage of completion method based on  the relationship of costs incurred  to
date  to estimated total costs under  the respective contracts. Lease revenue is
recognized as earned.
 
  ACCOUNTING CHANGES
 
    Effective June 1, 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 109 "Accounting  for Income Taxes." Prior years'  results
were  not restated.  The cumulative  effect of the  accounting change  was a tax
benefit of $900 ($.06 per share) recorded in the three-month period ended August
31, 1993.  The  adoption  of  SFAS  No. 109  changes  the  Company's  method  of
accounting  for income taxes  from the deferred  method of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion ("APB") No. 11 to the asset and liability method of accounting.
 
    Effective June  1,  1993  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106  "Employers'
Accounting  for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other  than  Pensions."  Prior years'
results were not restated. SFAS No. 106 requires that the projected future  cost
of  nonpension postretirement benefits be recognized  as an expense as employees
render services instead of when claims are incurred, as the Company had done  in
the  past. Upon adoption, the Company elected,  as permitted under SFAS No. 106,
to record a one-time transition obligation of $1,350 ($890 after tax or $.06 per
share) which represents that portion of future retiree benefit costs related  to
service  already rendered by both active and retired employees up to the date of
adoption. The initial  accumulated postretirement benefit  obligation of  $1,350
primarily  represented health  and life  insurance benefits  for certain current
employees and retirees.
 
    In fiscal  1995  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS") No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."
Prior years' results were not restated. This standard requires an accrual method
of recognizing  the  costs  of providing  postemployment  benefits  relating  to
employee  severance, disability,  health and  life insurance.  Since the Company
either does not provide such benefits  or accounted for those benefits  provided
on  an accrual basis,  the cumulative after-tax  charge of accruing  the cost of
benefits under this statement was not  significant to the results of  operations
in fiscal 1995.
 
  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
    The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 121 "Accounting for
the  Impairment of  Long-Lived Assets and  for Long-Lived Assets  to Be Disposed
Of " in March 1995 and SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" in
October 1995. The requirements

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
of SFAS No. 121 are that a  company review for impairment long-lived assets  and
certain  identifiable intangibles held  or to be  disposed of by  an entity when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be  recoverable as  defined by  the standard.  Under SFAS  No. 123,  the
Company  is encouraged, but not required, to  adopt a fair value-based method of
accounting for  stock-based employee  compensation plans.  This method  measures
compensation  cost  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  stock-based  award and
recognizes that cost over the employee's  service period. Entities may elect  to
adopt  the method recommended under this standard  or to continue to account for
these types of compensation plans under the current accounting standard, APB No.
25 "Accounting for Stock Issued  to Employees" with additional disclosures.  The
Company  is required to adopt these new  standards in its fiscal year ending May
31, 1997 and does not expect the adoption of these statements to have a material
impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
 
  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents. At  May  31,  1996  and  1995,  cash
equivalents  of  approximately $25,504  and $19,129,  respectively, held  by the
Company represent investments  in funds holding  high-quality commercial  paper,
Eurodollars and U.S. Government agency-issued securities. The carrying amount of
cash equivalents approximates fair value at May 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
 
  FOREIGN CURRENCY
 
    Gains  and  losses  on  foreign currency  translation  and  foreign exchange
contracts are determined in accordance with the method of accounting  prescribed
by  SFAS No.  52. All  balance sheet  accounts of  foreign and  certain domestic
subsidiaries  transacting  business  in  currencies  other  than  the  Company's
functional  currency are  translated at  year-end or  historical exchange rates.
Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the  year.
Translation  adjustments are  excluded from  the results  of operations  and are
recorded in Stockholders' equity as Cumulative translation adjustments.
 
    The Company from time to time uses forward exchange contracts or options  to
hedge its loss exposure from the translation of foreign subsidiaries' results of
operations  from  functional  currencies  into  United  States  dollars. Forward
exchange contracts or options  losses are included in  results of operations  in
the  period  the loss  is determinable.  Gains are  recorded when  realized upon
contract settlement. At May 31, 1996 and during fiscal 1996 and 1995 there  were
no  forward  exchange  contracts  or options  outstanding.  Foreign  and certain
domestic subsidiaries  incur transaction  gains and  losses upon  settlement  of
obligations  in currencies other  than their functional  currency. The aggregate
net transaction  gains (losses),  including those  related to  forward  exchange
contracts,  reported  in results  of operations  were $239,  $45, and  $(32) for
fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF MARKET OR CREDIT RISK
 
    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of market or credit  risk consist principally of  forward exchange contracts  or
options  and  trade  receivables.  The  forward  exchange  contracts  previously
discussed subject  the Company  to  market risk  from exchange  rate  movements.
Accordingly,  the  Company  recognizes  losses in  the  period  such  losses are
determinable. While the  Company's trade  receivables are diverse  based on  the
number of

entities  and  geographic  locations,  the  majority  are  concentrated  in  the
aerospace/aviation industry.  The  Company performs  evaluations  of  customers'
financial  condition prior to  extending credit privileges  and performs ongoing
credit evaluations of payment experience,  current financial condition and  risk
analysis.  The Company  typically requires  collateral in  the form  of security
interest in  assets, letters  of credit,  obligation guarantees  from  financial
institutions,  or sells  its receivables,  usually on  a nonrecourse  basis, for
transactions other than normal trade terms.
 
    SFAS No.  107  "Disclosures  About  Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments"
requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Cash and
cash  equivalents, accounts receivable,  short-term borrowings, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities are reflected in the financial statements at fair  value
because  of  the  short-term  maturity of  these  instruments.  Noncurrent notes
receivable and long-term debt bearing a variable interest rate are reflected  in
the financial statements at fair value. Those bearing a fixed interest rate have
fair  values based on estimates using discounted future cash flows at an assumed
discount rate for borrowing currently prevailing in the marketplace for  similar
instruments.
 
    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant
market   information  about  the  financial   instrument.  These  estimates  are
subjective in  nature  and  involve uncertainties  and  matters  of  significant
judgment   and  therefore  cannot  be  determined  with  precision.  Changes  in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
 
  INVENTORIES
 
    Inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by
either the specific identification, average cost or first-in, first-out  method.
Inventoried costs relating to long-term contracts and programs are stated at the
actual  production costs, including factory burden and initial tooling, incurred
to date,  reduced  by  amounts  identified  with  revenue  recognized  on  units
delivered. The costs attributed to units delivered under long-term contracts and
programs  are based on the  estimated average cost of  all units scheduled to be
produced. Progress billings under government contracts are based on an allowable
percentage of  the  cost of  material  received  and labor  and  factory  burden
incurred.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
  EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES
 
    Lease  revenue is recognized as earned. The cost of the asset under lease is
original purchase  price  plus  overhaul  costs. Depreciation  of  the  cost  is
computed  on  a straight-line  method  over the  estimated  service life  of the
equipment and  maintenance costs  are expensed  as incurred.  The balance  sheet
classification  is based on the  lease term with fixed  term leases under twelve
months classified as short-term and all others classified as long-term.
 
    Equipment on short-term lease consists of  aircraft engines and parts on  or
available  for lease to satisfy  immediate short-term customer requirements. The
leases are renewable  with fixed  terms, which generally  vary from  one to  six
months.
 
  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
 
    Depreciation  is computed on  the straight-line method  over useful lives of
10-40 years  for  buildings  and  improvements and  3-10  years  for  equipment,
furniture  and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the estimated
useful life or the term of the applicable lease.
 
    Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Upon sale  or
disposal,  cost and accumulated  depreciation are removed  from the accounts and
related gains and losses included in results of operations.
 
  LEVERAGED LEASES
 
    The Company acts as an  equity participant in leveraged lease  transactions.
The  equipment cost in excess of equity contribution is furnished by third-party
financing in the  form of secured  debt. Under the  lease agreements, the  third
parties  have no recourse against the Company for nonpayment of the obligations.
The third-party debt is  collateralized by the  lessees' rental obligations  and
the  leased equipment. The Company has ownership rights to the leased assets and
is entitled to the  investment tax credits, and  benefits of tax deductions  for
depreciation  on  the  leased  assets  and  for  interest  on  the  secured debt
financing.
 
  COST IN EXCESS OF UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES
 
    The cost in excess of underlying  net assets of companies acquired is  being
amortized over a period of forty years. Amortization was $230 in fiscal 1996 and
1995  and $240  in fiscal 1994.  Accumulated amortization is  $3,385, $3,155 and
$2,950 at May 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
  INCOME TAXES
 
    Income taxes  are determined  in accordance  with the  method of  accounting
prescribed by SFAS No. 109.
 
    Federal  income  taxes are  not provided  on  the undistributed  earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries (approximately $8,000  and $15,200 at May 31,  1996
and  1995, respectively), as it is the Company's intention to reinvest a portion
of these earnings indefinitely in the foreign operations. From time to time,  as
the  earnings  are treated  as taxable  in  the United  States, the  related tax
expense would be  offset substantially  by foreign tax  credits. Foreign  income
taxes  are provided  at the  local statutory  rates and  reflect estimated taxes
payable.

    At May 31, 1996, aggregate unsecured bank credit arrangements were $132,977.
Of this amount, $66,000  was available under credit  lines with domestic  banks,
$60,000  was  available under  revolving credit  and  term loan  agreements with
domestic banks and  $6,977 was  available under credit  agreements with  foreign
banks.  All domestic and foreign credit lines were unused at May 31, 1996. There
are no compensating balance requirements in connection with domestic or  foreign
lines  of credit. Borrowings under domestic bank lines bear interest at or below
the corporate base rate.

    The Company  may borrow  a  maximum of  $60,000 ($30,000  available  through
August  31, 1996 and  an additional $30,000 available  through October 15, 1996)
under revolving credit and term  loan agreements with domestic banks.  Revolving
credit  borrowings  may, at  the Company's  option, be  converted to  term loans
payable in equal quarterly  installments over five years.  Interest is based  on
corporate  base  rate or  quoted Eurodollar  or  multicurrency rates  during the
revolving credit period, and 1/2% over corporate base rate or quoted  Eurodollar
rate  thereafter. There were no borrowings under these agreements outstanding at
May 31,  1996. There  are no  compensating balance  requirements on  any of  the
committed  lines but the Company is required  to pay a commitment fee. There are
no restrictions on the withdrawal or use of these funds.

    The Company is subject to a  number of covenants under the revolving  credit
and  term loan agreements, including restrictions which relate to the payment of
cash dividends,  maintenance of  minimum net  working capital  and tangible  net
worth  levels, sales of assets, additional  financing, purchase of the Company's
shares and other  matters. The  Company is  in compliance  with all  restrictive
financial   provisions  of  the  agreements.   At  May  31,  1996,  unrestricted
consolidated retained earnings available for  payment of dividends and  purchase
of  the  Company's shares  was approximately  $15,772.  Effective June  1, 1996,
unrestricted  consolidated  retained  earnings  increased  to  $23,778  due   to
inclusion of 50% of the consolidated net income of the Company for fiscal 1996.
 
    The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing during each of the next five
fiscal years is $1,474 in 1997, $1,474 in 1998, $1,545 in 1999, $184 in 2000 and
$57  in  2001.  The fair  value  of  the Company's  long-term  debt approximates
carrying value.

    The deferred tax provisions result  primarily from differences between  book
and tax income arising from depreciation and leveraged leases. Refundable income
taxes  included  within Deferred  tax  assets, deposits  and  other, principally
represent refunds of Federal income taxes resulting from additional tax benefits
generated from export sales and foreign tax credits carried back to prior years.
Interest income relating to refundable income taxes was $371 and $576 for fiscal
1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    Deferred tax liabilities and assets result primarily from the differences in
the timing  of the  recognition for  transactions between  book and  income  tax
purposes and consist of the following components:

3.  INCOME TAXES -- (CONTINUED)
    The Company has determined, more likely than not, that a valuation allowance
is  not required, based upon the  Company's history of prior operating earnings,
its expectations for  continued future  earnings and the  scheduled reversal  of
deferred  tax liabilities, primarily  related to leveraged  leases, which exceed
the amount of the deferred tax assets.
 
    The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by  applying
the  United States statutory Federal income tax  rate of 35% for fiscal 1996 and
34% for fiscal 1995 and 1994 for the following reasons:

    The options are granted at prices equal  to the closing market price on  the
date of grant, become exercisable at such times as may be specified by the Board
of  Directors or as otherwise  provided by the applicable  stock option plan and
expire five to ten years from date of grant. Upon exercise of stock options, the
excess of the proceeds over par value, or cost in the case of Treasury stock, is
credited to Capital surplus in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    The AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan  also provides for the grant of  restricted
stock  awards. Restrictions  are released  at the  end of  applicable restricted
periods. The number of shares and  the restricted period, which varies from  two
to  ten years,  are determined  by the  Compensation Committee  of the  Board of
Directors. The market value of the award on  the date of grant is recorded as  a
deferred  expense, Common  stock and  Capital surplus.  The deferred  expense is
included in results of operations over the restricted term. The expense relating
to outstanding restricted stock awards was  $516, $266 and $538 in fiscal  1996,
1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    The  AAR CORP. Employee Stock Purchase Plan  is open to all employees of the
Company (other than officers,  directors or participants  in other stock  option
plans  of the Company) with six months of service. The plan permits employees to
purchase common stock  in periodic offerings  at the lesser  of the fair  market
value  on  date of  offering or  85% of  the fair  market value  on the  date of
exercise. A participating employee pays for  shares by payroll deduction over  a
two-year  period. Upon  completion of the  purchase, the excess  of the proceeds
over the  par value  (or cost  in the  case of  treasury stock)  is credited  to
Capital surplus.

    Pursuant to a shareholder rights plan  adopted in 1987 and amended in  1989,
each  outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock carries with it a Right to
purchase one  additional share  at  a price  of  $85 (subject  to  anti-dilution
adjustments).  The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when
certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 20% or more of  the
common stock by a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") or the commencement of
a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the Common Stock.
 
    In  the event that  an Acquiring Person  acquires 20% or  more of the Common
Stock, or if the Company is the  surviving corporation in a merger involving  an
Acquiring  Person,  or  if the  Acquiring  Person  engages in  certain  types of
self-dealing transactions, each Right  entitles the holder  to purchase for  $85
(or the then current exercise price) shares of the Company's Common Stock having
a  market value of  $170 (or two  times the exercise  price), subject to certain
exceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other  business
combination  or 50% or more  of its assets or earning  power is sold, each Right
entitles the holder to purchase at  the then current exercise price that  number
of  shares of Common Stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of
two times  the exercise  price. The  Rights,  which do  not entitle  the  holder
thereof  to vote or  to receive dividends, expire  on August 6,  1997 and may be
redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right under certain circumstances.
 
    On September 21,  1990, the  Board of  Directors authorized  the Company  to
purchase  up to 1,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock on the open market or
through privately negotiated transactions.  As of May 31,  1996 the Company  had
purchased 406 shares of Common Stock on the open market under this program at an
average price of $13.00 per share.
 
5.  NET INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK
 
    Primary  net income  per share  is computed  by dividing  net income  by the
weighted average number of shares of  common stock and common stock  equivalents
outstanding during the year. Shares granted as restricted stock awards under The
AAR  CORP. Stock Benefit Plan are considered outstanding from the date of grant.
Common Stock equivalents consist of the  average number of shares issuable  upon
the  exercise of  all dilutive  employee stock  options, less  the common shares
which could  have  been purchased,  at  the  average market  price  during  each
quarter, with the assumed proceeds from the exercise of the options.
 
6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
    The  Company  has defined  contribution  or defined  benefit  plans covering
substantially all  full-time domestic  employees and  certain employees  in  The
Netherlands.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)
  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS
 
    The  pension  plans for  domestic salaried  employees have  benefit formulas
based primarily on years  of service and compensation.  The pension benefit  for
hourly  employees is generally based on a  fixed amount per year of service. The
Company follows  the  provisions of  SFAS  No. 87,  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Pensions" for all domestic and nondomestic pension plans.
 
    The  Company's funding policy for domestic  plans is to contribute annually,
at a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes  and
that  is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits. Contributions
are intended  to provide  for benefits  attributed to  service to  date and  for
benefits  expected to be earned  in the future. The  assets of the pension plans
are invested primarily in  mutual funds, common  stocks, investment grade  bonds
and United States Government obligations.
 
    Certain foreign operations of domestic subsidiaries also have pension plans.
In  most cases, the plans are defined benefit in nature. Assets of the plans are
comprised of insurance contracts. Benefit formulas are similar to those used  by
domestic  plans. It  is the policy  of these  subsidiaries to fund  at least the
minimum amounts required by local law and regulation.
 
    The following  table sets  forth the  plans' funded  status and  the  amount
recognized  in the Company's Consolidated Balance  Sheets. The plans are grouped
according to  the  portion  of  the accumulated  benefit  obligation  funded  as
follows:

    The  projected benefit obligation for domestic  plans is determined using an
assumed weighted average  discount rate of  8.25% and 8.5%  for fiscal 1996  and
1995,  respectively, and an assumed average compensation increase of 3.0% in the
first two years and  5.0% thereafter. The expected  long-term rate of return  on
assets  is 10.0% for fiscal 1996 and  1995. Unrecognized net loss, prior service
cost and transition obligation are amortized  on a straight-line basis over  the
estimated average future service period.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)
    The  projected benefit obligation for  nondomestic plans is determined using
an assumed weighted average discount rate of  6.5% and 7.5% for fiscal 1996  and
1995, respectively, and an assumed average compensation increase of 2.0% for the
first  five years and 4.0% thereafter. The  expected long-term rate of return on
assets is 6.5% for fiscal 1996 and 1995.
 
    The provisions of SFAS No.  87 "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"  require
recognition  in the balance sheet of  an additional minimum liability, an equity
reduction and  related  intangible assets  for  pension plans  with  accumulated
benefits  in excess of  plan assets. At May  31, 1995 the  Company had a minimum
pension liability of  $3,765 reported within  Retirement benefit obligation  and
deferred  credits  in the  Consolidated Balance  Sheets  with $1,370  charged to
Stockholders' equity in accordance  with the provisions of  SFAS No. 87.  During
fiscal  1996, the Company's funding of  the domestic plans eliminated the charge
to Stockholders' equity.

  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN
 
    The  defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended to
qualify as  a 401(k)  plan under  the  Internal Revenue  Code. Under  the  plan,
employees  may contribute up  to 15.0% of their  pretax compensation, subject to
applicable regulatory limits. The Company may make matching contributions up  to
6.0%  of compensation.  Participants vest immediately  in Company contributions.
Expense charged to results of operations was $815, $830 and $800 in fiscal 1996,
1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
  DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE AND KEY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND PROFIT SHARING
PLANS
 
    The Company provides its outside directors with benefits upon retirement  on
or after age 65 provided they have completed at least five years of service as a
director.  Benefits are  payable as  a quarterly annuity  in an  amount equal to
25.0% of  the annual  retainer fee  payable  by the  Company to  active  outside
directors.  Payment of  benefits commences upon  retirement and  continues for a
period equal to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a
director to  a maximum  of ten  years,  or death,  whichever occurs  first.  The
Company  also provides supplemental  retirement and profit  sharing benefits for
current and former executives and key employees to supplement benefits  provided
by  the Company's other  benefit plans. The  plans are not  fully funded and may
require funding in the event of a change in control of the Company as determined
by the Company's Board  of Directors. Expense charged  to results of  operations
for  these  plans  was  $555, $585  and  $545  in fiscal  1996,  1995  and 1994,
respectively.

  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
    The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible
employees and retirees under  a variety of plans.  Generally these benefits  are
contributory,  with retiree contributions  adjusted annually. The postretirement
plans are unfunded and the Company has  the right to modify or terminate any  of
these  plans  in  the  future,  in certain  cases  subject  to  union bargaining
agreements. In fiscal 1995 the  Company completed termination of  postretirement
healthcare  and  life  insurance  benefits attributable  to  future  services of
collective bargaining and  other domestic employees.  The Company recognized  an
after  tax gain  of $250  from the  reduction in  the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation related to this termination of benefits.
 
    Postretirement benefit cost for the years ended May 31, 1996, 1995 and  1994
included the following components:

    The  assumed discount rates  used to measure  the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation were 8.25% and 8.5%  at May 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
The  assumed rate of future  increases in health care  costs was 10.1% in fiscal
1996 and 1995, declining  to 6.0% by  the year 2003 and  remaining at that  rate
thereafter.  A one percent increase  in the assumed health  care cost trend rate
would  increase   the   accumulated   postretirement   benefit   obligation   by
approximately  $26 as  of May  31, 1996  and would  not result  in a significant
change to the annual postretirement benefit expense.

7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    The Company leases  certain facilities and  equipment under agreements  that
expire  at various  dates through  2011. Rental  expense under  these leases was
$6,828, $6,545 and $4,840 in fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    Future minimum payments under leases with initial or remaining terms of  one
year  or more  at May 31,  1996 were $4,745  for fiscal 1997,  $4,268 for fiscal
1998, $3,775 for fiscal 1999, $3,253 for fiscal 2000 and $1,925 for fiscal  2001
and thereafter.
 
    The  Company routinely issues letters of credit, performance bonds or credit
guarantees in  the  ordinary  course  of its  business.  These  instruments  are
typically  issued  in conjunction  with insurance,  contracts, sales  of secured
accounts  receivables  or  other  business  requirements.  The  total  of  these
instruments outstanding at May 31, 1996 was approximately $25,800.
 
    The  Company is involved in various claims  and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course  of  business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  ultimate
disposition  of these  matters will  not have a  material adverse  effect on the
Company's consolidated financial condition.
 
8.  AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES
    The Company  is an  owner  participant in  four leveraged  lease  agreements
entered  into  between March  1986  and May  1988.  These agreements  cover four
narrow-body commercial  aircraft  and  spare  parts.  The  transactions  involve
aircraft currently operated by major carriers. The remaining terms of the leases
range  from 5  to 8  years. The  Company's equity  investment in  these aircraft
represents  approximately  one-third  of  the  aggregate  equipment  cost.   The
remaining  portion of the equipment cost  is financed by third-party nonrecourse
debt.
 
    The Company has ownership  rights to the equipment  subject to the right  of
the  lessees to exercise certain purchase,  renewal and termination options. For
Federal income tax purposes, the Company receives investment tax credits and has
the benefit of tax deductions for  depreciation on the aggregate equipment  cost
and  interest on  the nonrecourse  debt. During  the early  years of  the lease,
Federal income tax  deductions exceeded the  lease rental income.  In the  later
years  of the lease, rental  income will exceed the  deductions. In fiscal 1994,
the Company's Investment in leveraged  leases was repriced approximately  $2,000
for  the  impact of  an interest  rate reduction  on nonrecourse  long-term debt
secured by aircraft under leveraged lease, the tax rate change under the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and  the Company's AMT position in  accordance
with SFAS No. 13 "Accounting for Leases."
 
    In  August 1990, the  Company sold a  partial residual interest  in a Boeing
737-300 aircraft currently subject to a leveraged lease. The lease term  expires
in March 2001. The principal portion of the proceeds from this sale was received
in  the form of a $2,000  note, bearing interest at 9.9%,  due in March 2001 and
was included  with  Retirement  benefits,  notes receivable  and  other  on  the
Consolidated   Balance  Sheets.  During  fiscal  1996,  the  note  was  sold  at
approximately the outstanding principal and accrued interest receivable balance.

                             FURTHER RESTATED AND AMENDED
                      EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT DATED AUGUST 1, 1985
                     BY AND BETWEEN AAR CORP. AND IRA A. EICHNER
                    ---------------------------------------------


    THIS AMENDMENT NO. 2 made this 25th day of MAY, 1990 by and
between AAR CORP., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Ira A. Eichner
("Employee").

    WHEREAS, the Company and Employee entered into the Further Restated and
Amended Employment Agreement dated August 1, 1985 (the "Employment Agreement");
and

    WHEREAS, the Company and Employee heretofore amended the Employment
Agreement and now desire to further amend the Employment Agreement as herein set
forth to reflect certain mutually agreed upon changes to the terms and
conditions thereof;

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
herein contained, the Company and Employee do hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

    1.   The second sentence of subparagraph (b) of paragraph 7 of the
Employment Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

         "During, or as soon as practicable after the end of, each calendar 
    year, the Company shall pay to Employee a bonus in cash equal to the 
    aggregate of (1) the federal, state and local income taxes, if any, 
    incurred by Employee as a result of income generated by the Trust, and
    (2) the federal, state and local income taxes incurred by Employee as a 
    result of such bonus."

    2.   The first and second sentences of subparagraph (c) of paragraph 11 of
the Employment Agreement are hereby amended to read as follows:

         "If within twenty-four months from the date hereof the Company does
    not receive the private letter ruling, hereinafter described, from the
    Internal Revenue Service, the discretion vested in Employee by the
    preceding subparagraph (b) shall instead be vested in the Board of
    Directors of the Company and Employee shall not participate in such
    discretion either as a member of the Board of Directors or individually. 
    The private letter ruling referred to in the preceding sentence shall hold
    that Employee shall not recognize income for federal tax purposes under
    Section 83 or Section 451 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or pursuant
    to the constructive receipt or economic benefit doctrines, merely by being
    vested with the discretion set forth in subparagraph (b) above in any
    taxable year prior to the first to occur of (i) the taxable year in which a
    contribution to the Trust is made pursuant to subparagraph (b) above, and
    (ii) the taxable year in which Employee's Involuntary Retirement occurs."

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Amendment No. 2 to be
executed, and Employee has hereunto set his hand, on the date first set forth
above.
