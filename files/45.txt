Part I
- ------
Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

a)  General Development of Business

AFP Imaging Corporation (the "Company") was organized on September 20, 1978,
under the laws of the State of New York. Since its inception, the Company has
been engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and
distributing equipment for producing "hard copy" images by chemical processing
photosensitive materials as well as manufacturing other closely related
electro/optical imaging equipment. These products have been adapted to medical,
industrial, dental and graphic arts applications. The Company's products are
distributed to worldwide markets through a network of dealers.

On August 11, 1999, the Company successfully reduced and restructured, by $1.75
million, both of its Subordinated Promissory Notes, which were issued in 1997,
as part of the financing of two independent acquisitions. The restructuring was
accomplished by means of negotiation or mediation between the Company and each
of the parties. No additional equity, warrants or options were issued in
conjunction with the reduction and restructuring of these Subordinated
Promissory Notes. (See Management Discussion and Analysis for further
discussion).

b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments

The Company is engaged in two industry segments: medical/dental and graphic
arts. The Company's business segments are based on differences in the nature of
their operations including distribution channels and customers. The composition
of the segments is consistent with that used in making strategic decisions. See
Consolidated Financial Statements, Footnote 7, for further discussion of the
Company's industry segments.

c)  Narrative Description of Business

Principal Products and Services

Medical, Dental and Industrial X-Ray Processors & Accessories
- -------------------------------------------------------------

The Company manufactures and distributes a line of freestanding and table top
medical, dental and industrial x-ray film processors. These machines are capable
of processing or developing films of various sizes. The exposed film is inserted
into equipment and returned to the operator developed, fixed, washed and dried.
The equipment can be located either in a dark room site or adapted to a
daylight, loading system. These units are used for diagnostic x-ray imaging and
industrial, non-destructive testing applications. The Company's products are
distributed worldwide through an unaffiliated dealer network to doctors,
dentists, hospitals, medical clinics, and other facilities.

Digital Dental Imaging Systems
- ------------------------------

The Company manufactures and distributes a filmless digital dental radiography
system, based on x-rays and electronic imaging technology. Such technology
generates a patient's dental images on a computer screen that operates in a
Windows based software environment.

The Company manufactures and distributes intraoral video dental cameras. This
product allows users to capture up to four intraoral dental images on a computer
screen and features the mobility of the camera between operatories by "docking"
(plug in) directly into another chairside location. This system can be networked
and is compatible with the Company's digital dental radiography system. A
proprietary Windows based software suite provides for selection, transmission
and manipulation of the desired images by the dentist.

Diagnostic Imagers and Viewers
- ------------------------------

The Company manufactures a line of digital and analog multiformat compact
cameras to permanently record and document the images produced during diagnostic
examinations from several different applications. The cameras can produce
anywhere from one to six images on films that can be processed and developed in
Company manufactured film processors. The Company has the distribution rights to
a line of European monitors specifically designed for the high-resolution needs
of the medical display market.


<PAGE>

X-Ray Systems
- -------------

The Company has the distribution rights to a European dental x-ray machine for
the North American market. The Company has also obtained the distribution rights
to a Japanese panoramic dental x-ray machine for the North and South American
markets. The x-ray film exposed by each of these units is then developed in the
Company's processors. These x-ray products are also compatible with the
Company's digital x-ray unit.

Graphic Arts Processors
- -----------------------

The Company distributes various sized graphic arts processors which develop
different photosensitive materials such as rapid access film and papers. These
processors are intended for use with phototypesetting, graphics and other
pre-printing press applications. Newspapers, publishers and commercial printers
are primary customers for these products.

Patents and Trademarks


The Company presently owns many domestic and foreign utility patents which it
believes are material to the technology used in its products. The Company's
intellectual property includes several patents acquired as part of Regam's
digital dental technology. The Company is not aware of any patents held by
others that conflict with its current product designs. The Company has agreed to
pay a nominal royalty on the domestic sales of its digital dental systems to an
unrelated independent third party for the use of a format in their software.
Such amount is not material to the operations of the Company. The principal
technology applied to the construction of the Company's other products is
state-of-the-art but not considered proprietary. The Company owns several
domestic and foreign trademarks which it uses in connection with the marketing
of its products. The Company utilizes various domestic and international forms
of trademarks, including AFP Imaging, DENT-X, Sens-A-Ray 2000 and LOGE, among
others. The Company believes that these foreign utility patents and trademarks
are important, and is current on their filings worldwide.

Research and Development

The amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on primary research
activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of
existing products, all of which was Company sponsored, is as follows:


        1999                       1998                      1997
        ----                       ----                      ----
     $1,205,461                  $910,861                  $776,423


The Company conducts Research and Development activities internally as well as
contracts certain projects to qualified vendors and expert consultants. The
Company's Research and Development efforts and technologies have been increased
by business acquisitions completed in Fiscal Years 1997 and 1998. In each
transaction, the Company has added new product lines, proprietary technologies
and access to future research and development benefits. The Company's
participation (through its Swedish subsidiary) in a European Union (EU) Contract
to develop new x-ray imaging sensors was established in June 1996. This includes
but is not limited to CCD and CMOS type sensors. Research and Development costs
for Fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999 do not include the EU grants towards this
project. All dental applications resulting from the developed technology are
assigned exclusively to the Company. This contract expires in May 2000.

The Company's level of spending is discussed further in "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation".

Raw Materials

The Company does not utilize any unique or difficult to obtain raw materials or
processes in the design and manufacture of its products. The Company anticipates
that an adequate commercial supply of all raw materials will be available from
multiple sources.



<PAGE>



Sales, Marketing and Distribution

All of the Company's products are manufactured and distributed domestically and
internationally in two basic configurations. Certain products are custom
engineered and brand labeled for large OEMs. The balance of the Company's
products are brand labeled by the Company with its own trade names and are
distributed through an extensive network of independent medical, dental and
graphic arts dealers who install and service the equipment. The Company
maintains a significant marketing and regional sales management effort to
promote and support all of its products, in its worldwide markets.

The Company advertises in trade journals (domestic and international), provides
sales support and literature, prepares technical manuals and conducts customer
education and training programs in order to promote its products. In addition,
the Company participates in domestic and international trade and clinical shows.

Government Regulation

The United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), Bureau of Medical
Devices regulates the distribution of all equipment used as medical devices. The
Company has registered all of its medical products with this agency. The Bureau
of Medical Devices has the right to disapprove the marketing of any medical
device that it believes is unfit for the purposes intended. The Company believes
that its products and procedures satisfy all the criteria necessary to comply
with the regulations of the FDA's Bureau of Medical Devices. The Company's
manufacturing facility is ISO (International Standards Organization) 9001
certified. Where applicable, the Company's products are CE certified for
European sales in the Common Market.

Seasonal Nature

The Company's business is not considered seasonal.

Working Capital Practices

The Company engages in no unusual practices regarding inventories, receivables
or other items of working capital. The Company renegotiated its credit facility
with its existing lender in July 1997. Such credit facility was amended in
August 1999 and is subject to more restrictive terms and conditions. See Items 7
"Capital Resources and Liquidity" for further discussion. This facility expires
in July 2000. The Company hopes to enter into a comparable facility with similar
terms and conditions prior to such time. See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further
discussion.

Customers

No customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal 1999, 1998 or 1997.
Management does not believe the loss of any one customer would have a materially
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated business. Foreign markets and sales
are pursued by various international dealers.

Backlog Orders

As of June 30, 1999, the Company's backlog of orders for its products was
approximately $4,335,617 as compared to $2,302,590 as of June 30, 1998. All of
the orders included in the backlog at June 30, 1999 are scheduled for delivery
by June 30, 2000. OEM bulk purchase commitments are typically negotiated for
12-month periods but are not based on a calendar or fiscal year. Spare part
sales are not part of the Company's backlog calculations. In the opinion of the
Company, fluctuations in the backlog and its size at any given time are not
necessarily indicative of intermediate or long-term trends in the Company's
business. Much of the Company's backlog can be canceled or the delivery dates of
orders can be accelerated or extended without penalty. Delivery of capital
equipment is frequently subject to changing budget conditions of medical
institutions or end user clinical practitioners.


<PAGE>



Government Contracts

The Company has no current contracts with the federal government that are
material to the consolidated business. The Company's policy is to be responsive
to all governmental Request for Quotations (RFQ) which can be fulfilled within
the scope of the Company's product lines.

Competition

The Company's products utilize mechanical as well as analog and digital
electronic technologies. The Company is subject to both foreign and domestic
competition. The competition is characterized by significant investment in
research and development of new technologies, products and services. Some
competitors are well established in the film processor manufacturing and
distribution businesses and may have greater financial and distribution
resources and facilities than the Company. Other competitors have significant
resources and revenues in electronic digital imaging technologies and expertise
in software development. The Company relies on internal R&D personnel as well as
subcontracted vendors. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes
on the basis of price, features, product quality, applications, engineering,
promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company also manufacturers and
provides to other Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers different
product versions under each OEM brand label which may compete with each other as
well as the Company's products. The Company purchases certain products, from
others, for resale on a non-exclusive basis which may be subject to competition
from other independent distributors.

The Company competes in the dental imaging market on the basis of its
proprietary and patented technologies and its participation in a multi-year
European Union (EU) Research and Development contract. The Company will have the
exclusive rights to any dental applications as a result of this project. See
"Research and Development" for further discussion.

Environmental Impact

The Company believes it is in compliance with the laws and regulations governing
the protection of the environment and that continued compliance will not have a
material effect on its business or require any material capital expenditures.
The Company does not use any controlled or regulated materials or processes in
its operation. Compliance with local codes for the installation and operation of
the Company's products is the responsibility of the end user, or dealer who
independently provides such services.

Employees

As of June 30, 1999, the Company (and its wholly owned subsidiaries) employed
135 persons worldwide on a full-time basis. The Company has no collective
bargaining agreements and considers its relationship with its employees to be
satisfactory.

d)  Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

With respect to the Company's last three fiscal years, domestic sales were
$20,736,264 (1999), $22,106,153 (1998) and $23,527,612 (1997) representing 71%,
65% and 64%, respectively, of the Company's sales during such periods. Domestic
operating income (loss) was ($1,413,688), ($2,481,513) and $2,283,895 for the
years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Export and foreign sales
during such periods were $8,634,074 (1999), $11,666,554 (1998) and $13,520,898
(1997) or 29%, 35% and 36% of total Company sales for each period, respectively.
The Company's Swedish subsidiary, Regam, incurred operating losses of $268,200
and $108,900 for fiscal 1999 and 1998 and $154,600 for the period April 17, 1997
(acquisition date) through June 30, 1997.

Assets used in the manufacture of export sales are integrated with the
other assets of the Company.

Item 2. Properties
- -------------------

The Company's manufacturing facility is well maintained, is in good
operating condition, and has a productive capacity sufficient to meet the
Company's present and anticipated needs. The Company's executive offices
and principal manufacturing facility are located in Elmsford, New York.
This property is under a renegotiated lease expiring on December 31, 2008
at a current rental of $506,235 per year, with increments through the lease
term to $525,085, plus increases in real estate taxes, utility costs and
common area charges. The Company rents a small


<PAGE>

sales and marketing facility in Springfield, Virginia, and a small office at a
University in Sweden. The cost of each facility are not material to the
consolidated property costs.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
- -------------------------

The Company is currently defending a civil complaint filed on December 19,
1995, in Worcester, Massachusetts, in the Superior Court of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Such complaint was instituted by Tufts
Electronics Group, Inc. a former vendor of Visiplex Instruments Ltd., for
breach of New York Bulk Sales Notice, alleging that no notice of the bulk
transfer of assets was given in July 1995. The Company had acquired
selected assets and liabilities of Visiplex Instruments Ltd. in July 1995.
In addition, the plaintiff alleges a claim concerning certain inventories
and disputed invoices. The Company's defense maintains these matters were
settled by the parties prior to the acquisition, and the Company did not
assume such liabilities. Visiplex Instruments Ltd. provided the Company
with an Indemnification and Hold Harmless Agreement, which has a $500,000
limit. The amended complaint seeks damages in the sum of $443,500 for
unpaid material invoices and $19.9 million in consequential damages, treble
damages, interest and attorney fees. The Company's current motion for
summary dismissal of the amended claim was filed in July 1999. The Company
and its attorneys have concluded the discovery process and vigorously deny
there are any merits to the amended claim. At this time, the Company does
not believe that the final outcome of this matter will have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. The Company is
also a party to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course
of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend all such claims and
does not expect the outcome of these matters individually or in the
aggregate to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations. The Company's insurance policies cover
certain claims and allegations, as such, the underwriter is vigorously
assisting in the Company's defense.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
- -----------------------------------------------------------

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of Operation
- ------------

The following should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere herein.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company's working capital decreased $1,400,000 between fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 1998. The decrease is mainly due to a $1.1 million reduction in inventory
and a $800,000 reduction in accounts receivable resulting from the decline in
sales this year. The Company restructured and significantly lowered the balance
on its two outstanding subordinate notes payable, in August 1999, resulting in
payments totaling $250,000 in August 1999, which are classified as a current
liability. Additionally, the subordinate notes payable were classified as
long-term in fiscal 1998 (and fiscal 1999) so the debt restructuring did not
reduce working capital. The Company also utilized available cash funds to
finance the repurchase of its common stock from a former director.

The Company successfully reduced and restructured both of its Subordinated Notes
which were issued in 1997, as part of two independent acquisitions. The net
result of the settlements is a combined debt reduction of $1.75 million. No
additional Common Stock, warrants or options were issued in conjunction with the
reduction of these Subordinated Notes Payable. The Company's Balance Sheet and
financial condition were greatly strengthened by the complete elimination, for
the next several years, of large principal payments.

In December 1997, the Company acquired the assets of a Vancouver, WA
manufacturer of intraoral (dental) video cameras and related products. The
purchase price was $3.5 million of which $1.1 million cash was paid at closing,
and the Company issued a Subordinated Promissory Note for $2.5 million to be
paid in semi-annual payments beginning January 1, 1999. The Company did not make
the required $500,000 payments due January 1, 1999 and July 1, 1999, and invoked
the provision for negotiation and mediation. On August 11, 1999, the Company and
the Note Holder agreed to an immediate, significant reduction and restructuring
of the $2.5 million Note. The Company will not be obligated to pay the two
$500,000 installments which were past due and in dispute. The Note was reduced
from $2.5 million to $850,000 in total, to be paid over a six year period and
the Company agreed and paid $150,000 to the Note Holder. Interest only will be
paid for the first three years; then, the Company will make thirty-six equal
monthly payments of $23,611.11 plus interest, on the unpaid balance. Interest
was fixed at 7.75% per annum for the six year period. There are no other debt to
equity conversions, contingent payments or further amendments to the
arrangement. The benefit to the Company by the reduced value of the $2.5 million
Note was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 1999. While this restructuring
resulted in a gain, the amount was offset by impairment charges associated with
the book value of the acquired assets.

In April 1997, the Company acquired all of the shares of a Swedish manufacturer
of digital, dental imaging systems. The initial purchase price was $2.9 million
of which $1.5 million, in cash, was paid at closing, plus, the Company issued a
Subordinated Note for $1.0 million due April 17, 2000, with interest at the
London Rate (LIBOR) plus 2% which is approximately 7.226%. On August 11, 1999,
the Company and this Note Holder agreed to an immediate reduction and
restructuring of this Note, which will be recorded in the first quarter Fiscal
2000. The principal amount of the Note was reduced to $800,000 in total. This
will also be paid over a six year period. Interest only will be paid for the
first three years, followed in 2003 by thirty-six equal monthly payments of
$22,222.22 plus interest, on the unpaid balance. Interest will remain at LIBOR +
2% for the six year period. The Company paid $100,000 plus accrued interest from
April 17, 1999 to August 10, 1999 to the Note Holder. A final royalty payment,
which is contingent on sales, is due on April 17, 2000 but has been capped at a
maximum of $30,000. There are no other debt to equity conversions, contingent
payments or further amendments to this acquisition.

The Company has a senior credit facility consisting of a $9.85 million revolver
and term loan facility (the "Revolving Credit Loan"). This credit line is
sufficient to finance ongoing working capital requirements assuming that the
Company's losses from operations do not continue for a material period of time.
The Revolving Credit Loan is secured by available and eligible inventory,
accounts receivable, equipment, life insurance policies and proceeds thereof,
trademarks, licenses, patents and general intangibles. This facility requires
that certain financial ratios and net worth amounts be maintained. The Company
is currently in compliance with all of its covenants and terms, with the
exception of the debt service coverage ratio. Its senior lender has waived
compliance with such coverage ratio for the period ended June 30, 1999. Such
waiver is subject to more restrictive terms and conditions relating to certain
areas, including documentation and reporting, revised formula borrowing, and
limitations on payments to subordinated note holders. The lender agreed to this
waiver after noting that fiscal 1999 operations were negatively impacted by the
significant operating expenses associated with the Company's new digital dental
product lines. This facility was renewed in July 1997 and expires in July 2000.
The Company expects to renew this facility with similar terms and conditions
prior to its expiration. The Company is dependent upon its existing credit
facilities to finance its

<PAGE>


overall operations. At June 30, 1999, the Company currently had available $1.2
million of unused lines of credit for short-term financing needs plus cash and
cash equivalents of $249,000.

The Company's historical operating cash flows have been positive; however, the
Company is dependent upon its existing credit facilities to finance its ongoing
operations. The Company expects its need for working capital will continue to be
financed by operations and from borrowings on its credit facility. The Company
is presently unaware of any other trends, demands, commitments or contingencies
which are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in its
liquidity or Capital Resources in the foreseeable future, except for any ongoing
losses from its operations. No assurances can be given that the Company will
have favorable cash flow in the near term or that the senior lender will grant
further waivers to the Company.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1999 of approximately $169,000, consisted of
individual computer workstation upgrades, production tooling, molds and other
appropriate replacements in the normal course of operations. In fiscal 1998, the
Company acquired a new Business Information System including the upgrade and
replacement of existing computer hardware and a new fully integrated
manufacturing software package. The Company committed to a three year lease for
the hardware and software costs, which has been recorded as a capital lease. All
implementation costs have been capitalized and are being amortized over three
years in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This system
was fully implemented during the third quarter of fiscal 1998 and was designed
to satisfy all Year 2000 compliance issues. The Company expects to continue to
finance any future capital requirements principally from internally generated
funds.

Year 2000 Compliance

The Company has developed and substantially implemented a plan to ensure that
all of its manufactured and developed products as well as internal systems are
compliant with the requirements to process transactions and function properly in
the year 2000. As described above, all of the Company's internal information
systems have been replaced with fully compliant new software and systems. The
total cost of the software, implementation and hardware were capitalized as
incurred. The Company continues to test and upgrade its internal information
systems as part of an overall operational plan to replace older systems with
more efficient current technology. The Company believes that all significant
costs related to the Year 2000 compliance issue have been incurred.

The Company also consulted with its processing banks and payroll service
provider to ensure that their services are Year 2000 compliant. The Company has
been advised by these service providers that all of these external information
services and systems are Year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the process of
contacting its vendors, on whom it relies, to assure that their systems are or
will be Year 2000 compliant. The Company will evaluate these responses to ensure
that critical vendors are Year 2000 compliant, or review alternate sourcing of
these materials to Year 2000 compliant vendors. The Company has reviewed their
own plant equipment and has determined that such equipment is either Year 2000
compliant or not affected by the Year 2000 issues.

The Company is in the process of developing contingency plans to address the
most reasonably likely worst case scenarios from the potential Year 2000
disruption. The Company's Year 2000 efforts are ongoing and will continue to
evolve as new information becomes available. The Company does not anticipate a
major interruption of its business activities, however, this will be dependent
in part upon the ability of third party vendors to be Year 2000 compliant.
Although the Company has implemented the actions described above to address
these third party issues, it has no direct ability to influence compliance
actions by such parties. The Company does not know, at this time, of any of its
products, processes or systems which, if found to be non-Year 2000 Compliant,
would have any significant impact. Accordingly, while the Company believes its
actions should help reduce the possible effects of the Year 2000 risks, it is
unable to eliminate the ultimate effects on the Company's operating results.

Euro Conversion

A single currency called the euro was introduced in Europe on January 1, 1999.
Eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union agreed to adopt the
euro as their common legal currency on that date. Fixed conversion rates between
these participating countries' existing currencies and the euro were established
as of that date, to remain legal tender as denominations until at least January
1, 2002. Beginning in January 2002, new euro-denominated bills and coins will be
issued. The Company has addressed the issues raised by the euro currency
conversion. All third-party computer and financial systems have the ability to
process euro-denominated transactions. The Company has also addressed the issue
of the impact of one common currency on pricing.

Results of Operation - Fiscal 1999 vs. Fiscal 1998
- --------------------------------------------------

On January 4, 1999, $500,000 became due under the Company's $2.5 million
promissory note issued to the former owner of ProDen. The Company withheld
payment on that note as the Company believed that the former owner breached the
terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 24, 1997 related to the
acquisition of ProDen. During fiscal 1999, the Company and the former owner
reached a commercial settlement whereby the $2.5 million note would be
extinguished and replaced with a new $850,000 subordinated note, payable over
six years and a payment of $150,000 in August 1999.

During the fourth quarter 1999, the Company recorded special charges of
approximately $2.1 million related to the Company's ProDen operations, due to
the recognized impairment in the value of this product line. The components of
these charges were as follows:


o     Approximately $1.3 million write down of goodwill, reducing the carrying
      amount of this asset to $0,

o     Approximately $140,000 reduction in the carrying value of other acquired
      long-lived assets, principally equipment, to fair market value,

o     Approximately $530,000 to establish reserves related to acquired accounts
      receivable and inventory, the value of which not having yet been realized
      through collection or sale, to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets
      to net realizable value, and,

o     Approximately $75,000 to establish a liability for the discontinuation of
      the former owner's consulting agreement with the Company, pursuant to the
      settlement arrangement described below.

The special charges, which were recorded during the fiscal third and fourth
quarters, were based on revised sales forecasts, historical operating results
and the progression of the Company's dispute relating to the note payment due to
the prior owner as described above. The amount of the charge related to the
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets was calculated using the
anticipated future discounted cash flows, as a proxy for fair value, of this
product line.

On August 11, 1999, the Company and ACG Nystromgrupen AB ("Nystrom") of Sweden,
agreed to an immediate reduction and restructuring of the Nystrom Subordinated
Note Payable. The Company paid $100,000 plus accrued interest from April 17,
1999 to August 10, 1999 to Nystrom, and the principal amount of the amended
Nystrom Subordinated Note Payable was reduce to $800,000 in total, to be paid
over a six year period. A royalty payment, contingent on sales, as per the
original Stock Purchase Agreement is due Nystrom in April 2000 but has been
capped at a maximum of $30,000. The Nystrom Note has been reclassified as
long-term in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to reflect the
restructuring. The gain on the restructuring of the Note will be recorded in the
first quarter of Fiscal 2000.

Sales decreased $4.4 million between the two fiscal years or 13%. All of the
Company's product lines experienced a decline in volume. The most significant
was in the graphic arts products which have been adversely affected due to the
evolving printing technology and changing customer demands. Fluctuating world
markets, combined with the strong US dollar reduced the Company's export sales
by approximately 27%. The dental products through the recent acquisitions and
marketing/distribution agreements, showed the most growth. The Company continues
to explore and develop potential distribution channels and new products through
engineering efforts, aggressive marketing as well as repositioning its product
pricing in the market place. Gross margin as a percent of sales showed a slight
decreases of .9 percentage points. The Company has absorbed slight increases in
material costs without any significant price increases in its products. A small
price increase was implemented on some products in July 1999 which should help
to improve the gross margin in Fiscal Year 2000.

Selling, General and Administrative costs decreased $474,400 or 5.2% between the
two fiscal years. Management instituted a financial restructuring plan this year
to reduce and/or eliminate all non-essential expenses. As sales volume did not
meet the original expectations, cost cutting and evaluation procedures were
implemented to curb all departmental costs. Additionally, sales commissions were
lower this year, as a direct relation to sales.

Research and Development cost increased $295,000 or $32.4%. The Company has
committed to the continued refinement of its digital dental products in order to
reduce costs and maintain market share. Additionally, the Company continues to
invest in sustaining engineering and related costs for its analog products. When
applicable, the Company is acting as master import distributors for products
developed by others.

Interest expense net increased $194,000 or 42% between the two fiscal years. The
Company's borrowing on its Revolving Credit Loan was higher in the current year
due to production, development and distribution requirements

<PAGE>

for the digital product lines. Additionally, fiscal 1998 only had six months of
the interest associated with the $2.5 million of debt related to the digital
dental product line acquisition.

The income tax benefit primarily reflects nominal state and foreign capital
taxes due, offset by the resolution of previous contingencies that had been
accrued for in prior years. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit for the
net loss in fiscal 1999, as the Company does not meet the criteria described in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" for recording such benefit.

Other

On March 19, 1999, the Company's Common Stock was de-listed from the NASDAQ
SmallCap Exchange as the Company's shares did not maintain a closing bid price
greater than $1.00 for 30 consecutive days. The Company is now listed on the
NASDAQ Over the Counter Bulletin Board.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards for Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging
Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes a comprehensive standard on accounting for
derivative and hedging activities and is effective for periods beginning after
June 15, 1999. Management does not believe that the future adoption of SFAS No.
133 will have a material effect on the Company's financial position and results
of operations.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking
statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in
general economic conditions, the ability of the Company to repay its loans,
including changes in the specific markets for the Company's services, the
ability of the Company to successfully design, develop, manufacture and sell new
products, adverse business conditions, increased competition, pricing pressures,
risk associated with foreign operations, the ability to attract and retain key
personnel, difficulties in obtaining adequate long-term financing to meet the
Company's obligations, various regulatory requirements throughout the world, and
other factors.

Results of Operation - Fiscal 1998 vs. Fiscal 1997
- --------------------------------------------------

On April 17, 1997 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Regam
Medical Systems International AB ("Regam"), a Swedish manufacturer of electronic
dental imaging equipment for cash and notes payables. The acquisition was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was fully consolidated
in fiscal 1997. The goodwill associated with this acquisition was written-down
to its net realizable value in the second quarter fiscal 1998, based on the
recognized impairment in the value of the operations, resulting in a charge to
earnings of $1.3 million. Such amount is included in Special Charges. The
remaining goodwill is being amortized over fourteen years on a straight-line
basis. Also included are $329,000 of non-recurring costs to shutdown and
relocate the manufacturing operations, marketing, technical service and customer
support operations from Sweden to the US. These costs also include severance and
required social tax payments to former employees.

In connection with the Company's acquisition of selected assets and liabilities
of ProDen, the Company determined, based upon an independent appraisal, that a
portion of the purchase price related to in-process research and development,
resulting in a charge of $1.7 million. Such amount is also included in Special
Charges.

Sales decreased $3.27 million between the two fiscal years or 8.8%. There
was a decrease in medical sales due to adjustments in OEM contracts and a
decrease in the sale of graphic arts products due to changing customer
demands and printing technology. The Company is repositioning its products
in the graphic arts market. The decrease in sales was offset by a 21%
increase in the Company's expanding dental product line, resulting mainly
from the two recent dental acquisitions. Gross margin as a percent of sales
decreased 1.4 percentage points due to a 15% increase in the sales of
distributor goods, which have lower gross margins, and higher initial
material costs on the newly acquired dental lines. As production and sales
increase for these products, the Company expects to achieve improved unit
production costs.

Selling, general and administrative costs remained relatively consistent between
the two fiscal years, decreasing $84,000 or 1%. Management continued its
programs to reduce administrative overhead costs and restructure staffing with
their related benefit costs. However, these costs were offset by additional
costs to promote and service the dental and medical products worldwide. Included
in these expenses in fiscal 1998 are the amortization costs of the two
acquisitions exclusive of the specific adjustments mentioned above and included
in Special Charges.


<PAGE>

Research and development costs increased $134,000 or 17% between the two fiscal
years. The Company continues to invest in sustaining engineering and related
costs. The Company has also increased its efforts to expand and develop its
emerging digital dental products to increase market share.

Interest expense, net increased $13,000 or 3% due to interest charges associated
with the two notes related to the recent acquisitions, offset by a slightly
lower average borrowing base during the year.

The income tax provision primarily represents nominal state and foreign capital
taxes due. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit for the net loss in
fiscal 1998, as the Company does not meet the criteria described in Statement of

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders of
AFP Imaging Corporation:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AFP Imaging
Corporation (a New York Corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and
1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1999. These financial statements and the schedule
referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of AFP Imaging Corporation and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 1998 and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying
Accounts, is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.
This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in
all material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   ------------------------------------------

                                  JUNE 30, 1999
                                  -------------

(1)    Accounting Policies:
       --------------------
       The Company
       -----------
       AFP Imaging Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, (the "Company")
       was organized on September 20, 1978, under the laws of the State of New
       York. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged in the business
       of designing, developing, manufacturing and distributing equipment for
       producing "hard copy" images by chemical processing photosensitive
       materials as well as manufacturing other electro/optical imaging
       equipment. These products have been adapted to medical industrial, dental
       and graphic arts applications. The Company's products are distributed to
       worldwide markets through a network of dealers and original equipment
       manufacturers.

       Principles of consolidation
       ---------------------------
       The consolidated financial statements include AFP Imaging Corporation and
       its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
       have been eliminated in consolidation.

       Revenue recognition
       -------------------
       Revenue is recognized by the Company when products are shipped and title
       passes to the customer.

       Use of estimates
       ----------------
       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
       and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
       period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       Cash and cash equivalents
       -------------------------
       Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with original maturities of
       three months or less.

       Inventories
       -----------
       Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead,
       are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market (net
       realizable value). At June 30, 1999 and 1998, inventories consist of the
       following:

                                                      1999           1998
                                                      ----           ----

          Raw materials and sub-component parts    $4,109,073      $4,958,225
          Work-in-process and finished goods        1,385,755       1,649,216
                                                    ---------       ---------

                                                   $5,494,828      $6,607,441
                                                   ==========      ==========

       Depreciation
       ------------
       Machinery and equipment is depreciated using straight-line and
       accelerated methods over estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten
       years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis
       over the shorter of 40 years or their estimated useful lives.

       Research and development costs
       ------------------------------
       Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. These
       costs have been incurred in connection with the design and development of
       the Company's products.

                                      F-8
<PAGE>
       Goodwill
       --------
       Goodwill is recorded at its estimated fair value when acquired. Goodwill
       is amortized on a straight-line basis, over periods ranging for 15-40
       years.

       The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and
       other long-lived assets to determine whether an impairment may exist. The
       Company considers relevant cash flow, estimated future operating results,
       trends and other available information in assessing whether the carrying
       value of the asset can be recovered. During both fiscal 1999 and 1998,
       the Company determined that the value of certain of its goodwill was
       impaired (See Note 9). Accordingly, the Company wrote-down the carrying
       value of its goodwill by approximately $1.3 million in 1999 and 1998,
       based upon management's best estimate of future cash flows associated
       with the related product lines, discounted for the time-value of money.
       These write-downs have been included in "Special Charges" in the
       accompanying financial statements. As of June 30, 1999, the Company
       believes that no impairment of any other long-lived assets exist.

       Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share
       --------------------------------------------------
       The computation of net earnings per common share is based upon the
       weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period
       plus, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect the effect of
       common shares contingently issuable. Basic and diluted earnings per
       common share for the fiscal years ended 1999, 1998 and 1997 are presented
       below:

       The diluted earnings per share computation reflects the effect of common
       shares contingently issuable upon the exercise of warrants, options and
       the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures and convertible
       preferred stock in periods in which such conversion would cause dilution.
       The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding does not
       include the conversion of 1,147,620 and 974,120 stock options in fiscal
       1999 and 1998, as such amounts are antidilutive when there is a loss. In
       fiscal 1997, the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
       does not include the conversion of 103,138 warrants as the exercise price
       of these warrants was greater than the average price of the Company's
       common stock during the year.

       In 1997, net earnings available for common shareholders differs between
       basic and diluted earnings per share due to interest expense, net of
       taxes, associated with the convertible subordinated debentures, which
       would not have been incurred assuming conversion at the beginning of the
       period.

       Adoption of new financial standards
       -----------------------------------
       The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income",
       which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
       income and its components in the financial statements. Earlier periods
       have been restated to conform with the standards set forth in SFAS No.
       130.

       The Company also adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an
       Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes standards
       for reporting certain information about each segment of the Company.

       The Company does not believe that pronouncements which have been issued
       but have not yet become effective will have a material impact on the
       Company's financial position or results of operations.

 (2)   Debt:
       -----
       As of June 30, 1999, the Company has an $8.4 million revolver loan and a
       $1.45 million term loan (together the "Credit Facility") at an interest
       rate of 3/4% above prime (8.5% at June 30, 1999). The Credit Facility is
       collateralized by accounts receivable, eligible inventory, equipment,
       life insurance policies and proceeds thereof, trademarks, licenses,
       patents, and general intangibles. The arrangement provides for
       restrictions on borrowings, requires certain financial ratios related to
       total debt, unsubordinated debt to tangible net worth and current assets
       to current liabilities be maintained and requires minimum levels of
       working capital, net worth and cash flow. As of June 30, 1999, the
       Company has exceeded maximum levels of the debt service coverage ratio
       covenant. The Company has obtained a waiver from its lender permitting
       the temporary non-compliance with the required financial ratios. The
       Company expects that it will remain in non-compliance through the quarter
       ended December 31, 1999, but will continue to be able to obtain waivers
       from its lenders.

       The Company has unused lines of credit available, subject to formula, of
       $5.2 million as of June 30, 1999 for short-term financing needs. The
       Credit Facility matures on July 14, 2000 and the Company expects to
       renegotiate this facility with similar terms and conditions.

       As of June 30, 1999 and 1998, debt consisted of the following:

       (a)    The term loan will be paid in monthly payments of $12,083 for the
              period through and including July 2000, with the residual balance
              of $1,015,000 due on July 14, 2000.

       (b)    This note payable consists of a $1.0 million promissory note,
              which was subsequently reduced and restructured (see Note 11) to
              ACG Nystromgruppen AB ("Nystrom"), the former parent of Regam
              Medical Systems International AB. The Nystrom promissory note
              bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2% (8.375% at June 30,
              1999) and, prior to being restructured, was payable in full on
              April 17, 2000.

       (c)    This note represents a promissory note payable to the former owner
              of ProDen Systems, Inc. ("ProDen"), in connection with the
              Company's acquisition of ProDen in December 1997. Under the terms
              of this note, as amended (see Note 9), $150,000 is due and payable
              on August 10, 1999 and the residual balance of $850,000 will be
              paid in 36 equal installments beginning in January 2002. The note
              bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%.

       The fair market value of all of the Company's debt approximates its
       carrying value.

       Maturities of debt by fiscal year ended June 30 are as follows:

                   2000                               $   427,958

       The Company has two employee incentive stock option plans, under which
       approximately 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock are authorized and
       available for issuance. Under the terms of the plans, options to purchase
       common stock of the Company may be granted at not less than 100% of the
       fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, or 110% of the fair
       market value if granted to persons owning more than 10% of the
       outstanding stock of the Company. Transactions for 1999, 1998 and 1997

       The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant
       using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following
       assumptions for grants in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997: dividend yield of
       0%; expected volatility ranging from 54% to 145%; expected life of five
       years and risk-free interest rate ranging from 4.38% to 7.35%.

       At June 30, 1999, outstanding options had exercise prices ranging from
       $.25 to $2.36 with a weighted - average remaining contractual life of 4
       years.

       The Company accounts for these plans pursuant to Accounting Principles
       Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," under which
       no compensation cost has been recognized. Had compensation cost for these
       plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates
       consistent with SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", the
       Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to
       the following pro forma amounts:

(5)    Profit Sharing Plan:
       --------------------
       The Company maintains a profit sharing plan and trust pursuant to which
       participants receive certain benefits upon retirement, death, disability
       and, to a limited extent, upon termination of employment for other
       reasons. Allocation among participants' interests, including officers and
       directors who are employees, is in accordance with Internal Revenue
       Service regulations.

       The aggregate amount contributed to the plan by the Company each fiscal
       year is determined by the Board of Directors following a review of the
       profits of such fiscal year. The plan requires no minimum contribution by
       the Company. Profit sharing expense of $0, $0, and $50,000 was recorded
       for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

(6)    Commitments and Contingencies:
       ------------------------------
       The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants (together with other
       third parties) in a legal claim alleging that the Company violated bulk
       sales laws upon the acquisition of Visiplex Instruments Ltd. ("Visiplex")
       in July 1995. The Company believes that this claim is without merit and
       continues to vigorously defend the litigation. While substantial monetary
       damages have been alleged in the lawsuit, the Company believes the actual
       outcome of this matter would not have a material adverse effect on the
       Company's financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, the
       Company has filed a cross claim against the former owners of Visiplex
       under an indemnification clause contained in the asset purchase agreement
       between the two parties.

       The Company is also a party to claims and litigation arising in the
       ordinary course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend all
       such claims and does not expect the outcome of these matters individually
       or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
       financial position or results of operations. The Company's insurance
       policies cover certain claims and allegations, as such, the underwriter
       is vigorously assisting in the Company's defense.

       The Company has leases for office and manufacturing facilities for
       periods expiring through fiscal year 2008. Approximate minimum annual
       rental payments under these leases as of the fiscal year ended June 30
       are as follows:
                2000                            $  506,000
                2001                               492,000
                2002                               477,000
                2003                               477,000
                2004 and thereafter              2,864,000

       Rent expense was approximately $708,000, $733,000 and $719,000 for the
       years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

(7)    Segment Information:
       --------------------
       The Company operates in two distinct industry segments: medical/dental
       and graphic arts. The Company's business segments are based on
       differences in the nature of their operations, including distribution
       channels and customers. The composition of the segments and measure of
       segment profit is consistent with that used in making strategic
       decisions.

       of ProDen Systems, Inc., a Vancouver, Washington manufacturer of
       intraoral dental camera systems for approximately $3.5 million in cash
       and notes. As discussed further in Note 9, the purchase price was
       subsequently reduced by approximately $1.4 million.

       The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly,
       a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired
       based on their estimated fair values. The Company also allocated a
       portion of the purchase price to in-process research and development
       expenditures, which reduced fiscal 1998 operating income by $1.7 million.
       Such allocation was recorded based on a third party appraisal of the
       value of the in-process research and development projects acquired as of
       the acquisition date. The balance of the purchase price was recorded as
       the excess of cost over net assets acquired ("goodwill"). As discussed in
       Note 9, no goodwill resulting from this acquisition remains as of June
       30, 1999 due to the purchase price adjustment discussed above and the
       write-off of $750,000 of goodwill which became impaired during 1999.

       On April 17, 1997 the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
       Regam Medical Systems International AB ("Regam"), a Swedish manufacturer
       of electronic dental imaging equipment for $2.9 million in cash and notes
       payable. The notes payable, totaling $1.2 million, were issued to the
       former owner of Regam (See Note 2), of which $200,000 was paid during
       fiscal 1998.

       The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
       accounting. Goodwill of approximately $2.8 million was originally
       recorded associated with this acquisition. A portion of this goodwill was
       deemed to be impaired during 1998 and, accordingly, was written-off in
       accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
       Standards No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
       For Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (See Notes 1 and 9).

       The following table reflects unaudited pro forma combined results of
       operations of the Company, ProDen and Regam on the basis that the
       acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 1997:

       In management's opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of
       operations are not indicative of the actual results that would have
       occurred had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of fiscal
       1997, or of future operations of the combined companies under the
       ownership and management of the Company.

(9)    Special Charges:
       ----------------
       On January 4, 1999, $500,000 became due under the Company's $2.5 million
       promissory note issued to the former owner of ProDen. The Company did not
       make payment on that note as the Company believed that the former owner
       breached the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 24,
       1997 related to the acquisition of ProDen. During fiscal 1999, the
       Company and the former owner reached a commercial settlement whereby the
       $2.5 million note would be extinguished and replaced with an $850,000
       note and a payment of $150,000, the terms of which are discussed in Note
       2. At the time the settlement was reached, the carrying value of the $2.5
       million note was approximately $2.3 million, net of unamortized discount.
       The resulting $1.3 million reduction in the carrying value of the debt
       was recorded as a component of the special charges.

       During 1999, the Company recorded special charges of approximately $2.1
       million related to the Company's ProDen operations, due to the recognized
       impairment in the value of this product line. The components of these
       charges are as follows:

       o      Approximately $1.3 million write down of goodwill, reducing the
              carrying amount of this asset to $0,

       o      Approximately $140,000 reduction in the carrying value of other
              acquired long-lived assets, principally equipment, to fair market
              value,

       o      Approximately $530,000 to establish reserves related to acquired
              accounts receivable and inventory, the value of which not having
              yet been realized through collection or sale, to reduce the
              carrying amounts of these assets to net realizable value, and

       o      Approximately $75,000 to establish a liability for the
              discontinuation of the former owner's consulting agreement with
              the Company, pursuant to the settlement arrangement described
              below.

       These special charges, which were recorded during the fiscal third and
       fourth quarters, were based on revised sales forecasts, historical
       operating results and the progression of the Company's dispute in regard
       to the note payment due to the prior owner as described below. The amount
       of the charge related to the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets
       was calculated using the anticipated future discounted cash flows, as a
       proxy for fair value, of this product line.

       In addition, in connection with the acquisition of ProDen, the Company
       allocated approximately $1.7 million of the purchase price to in-process
       research and development (See Note 8) during 1998.

       During fiscal 1998, the Company implemented a restructuring and
       integration program associated with the relocation of the Regam
       operations which reduced operating income by approximately $1.6 million.
       These charges included $329,000 of non-recurring costs to close down the
       Swedish plant and transfer all the manufacturing activities to the U.S.,
       such as severance and related social costs, production line set-up and
       training costs in the U.S., and costs to terminate various contracts in
       Sweden. This charge also includes an amount of $1.3 million to reduce the
       goodwill associated with the Company's acquisition of Regam, due to the
       recognized impairment in the value of the Swedish operations (See Note
       1).

(10)   Common-Stock Retirement:
       ------------------------
       On October 16, 1998, a director resigned his directorship of the Company.
       Effective with such resignation, the term of his one year consulting
       agreement, dated September 19, 1997, commenced. On October 19, 1998, the
       Company agreed to extend his consulting agreement through October 16,
       2001, whereby he would receive cash compensation of $8,333.33 per month,
       for the period and his existing stock options granted pursuant to the
       consulting agreement were modified by increasing the term from three
       years to four years, increasing the number of shares underlying the
       option from 150,000 to 300,000 common shares, and reducing the exercise
       price from $2.636545 to $0.75 per share. On October 19, 1998, the Company
       repurchased (and subsequently retired) 496,895 shares of the Company's
       common stock owned by the former director for an aggregate consideration
       of $372,672.

(11)   Subsequent Event:
       -----------------
       On August 11, 1999, the Company and ACG Nystromgruppen AB ("Nystrom") of
       Sweden, agreed to an immediate reduction and restructuring of the Nystrom
       Subordinated Note Payable. The Company paid $100,000 to Nystrom plus
       accrued interest from April 17, 1999 to August 10, 1999, and the
       principal amount of the amended Nystrom Subordinated Note Payable was
       reduced to $800,000 in total, to be paid over a six year period. Interest
       only will be paid quarterly for the first three years, followed by
       thirty-six equal monthly payments of $22,222.22 plus interest, paid
       quarterly, on the unpaid balance. Interest will remain at LIBOR + 2% for
       the six year period. A royalty payment, contingent on sales, as per the
       original Stock Purchase Agreement is due Nystrom on April 17, 2000 but
       has been capped at a maximum of $30,000. There are no other contingent
       payments or further amendments to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

                                                                   Exhibit 10(h)


                             AFP IMAGING CORPORATION
                             1999 STOCK OPTION PLAN

1.       Purposes.

The AFP IMAGING CORPORATION 1999 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN (the "Plan") is
intended to provide the employees, directors, independent contractors and
consultants of AFP Imaging Corporation (the "Company") and/or any subsidiary
thereof with an added incentive to commence and/or continue their services to
the Company and to induce them to exert their maximum efforts toward the
Company's success. By thus encouraging employees, directors, independent
contractors and consultants and promoting their continued association with the
Company, the Plan may be expected to benefit the Company and its stockholders.
The Plan allows the Company to grant Incentive Stock Options ("ISOs") (as
defined in Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), Non-Qualified Stock Options ("NQSOs") not intended to qualify under
Section 422(b) of the Code and Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") (collectively
the "Options"). The vesting of one or more Options granted hereunder may be
based on the attainment of specified performance goals of the participant or the
performance of the Company, one or more subsidiaries, or division of one or more
of the above.

2.       Shares Subject to the Plan.

The total number of shares of Common Stock of the Company, $.01 par value per
share (the "Common Stock"), that may be subject to Options granted under the
Plan shall be five hundred thousand (500,000) in the aggregate, subject to
adjustment as provided in Paragraph 8 of the Plan; however, the grant of an ISO
to an employee together with a tandem SAR or any NQSO to an employee together
with a tandem SAR shall only require one share of Common Stock available subject
to the Plan to satisfy such joint Option. The Company shall at all times while
the Plan is in force reserve such number of shares of Common Stock as will be
sufficient to satisfy the requirement of outstanding Options granted under the
Plan. In the event any Option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate
for any reason without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any
reason to be exercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased shares subject
thereto shall again be available for granting of Options under the Plan.

3.       Eligibility.

ISO's or ISO's in tandem with SAR's (provided the SAR meets the requirements set
forth in Temp. Reg. Section 14a.422A-1, A-39 (a) through (e) inclusive) may be
granted from time to time under the Plan to one or more employees of the Company
or of a "subsidiary" or "parent" of the Company, as the quoted terms are defined
within Section 424 of the Code. An Officer is an employee for such purposes.
However, a director of the Company who is not otherwise an employee is not
deemed an employee for such purposes. NQSOs and NQSOs in tandem SARs may be
granted from time to time under the Plan to one or more employees of the
Company, Officers, members of the Board of Directors, independent contractors,
consultants and other individuals who are not employees of, but are involved in
the continuing development and success of the Company and/or of a subsidiary of
the Company, including persons who have previously been granted Options under
the Plan.

4.       Administration of the Plan.

         (a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the
             Company as such Board of Directors may be composed from time to
             time or by a Stock Option Committee (the "Compensation Committee")
             which shall be comprised of at least two Outside Directors (as such
             term is defined in regulations promulgated from time to time with
             respect to section 162(m)(4)(c)(i) of the Code) appointed by such
             Board of Directors of the Company and/or an Option Committee,
             comprised of such individual or individuals as the Board of
             Directors of the Company may designate from time to time (such
             Option Committee and the Compensation Committee are collectively
             hereinafter referred to as the "Committee"). As and to the extent
             authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, a Committee
             may exercise the power and authority vested in the Board of
             Directors under the Plan. Within the limits of the express
             provisions of the Plan, the Board of Directors or Committee shall
             have the authority, in its discretion, to determine the individuals
             to whom, and the time or times at which, Options shall be granted,
             the character of such Options (whether ISOs, NQSOs, and/or SARs in
             tandem with NQSOs, and/or SARs in tandem with ISOs) and the number
             of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each Option, the manner
             and form in which

<PAGE>

             the optionee can tender payment upon the exercise of his Option,
             and to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules
             and regulations relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and
             provisions of Option agreements that may be entered into in
             connection with Options (which need not be identical), subject to
             the limitation that agreements granting ISOs must be consistent
             with the requirements for the ISOs being qualified as "incentive
             stock options" as provided in Section 422 of the Code, and to make
             all other determinations and take all other actions necessary or
             advisable for the administration of the Plan. In making such
             determinations, the Board of Directors and/or a Committee may take
             into account the nature of the services rendered by such
             individuals, their present and potential contributions to the
             Company's success, and such other factors as the Board of Directors
             and/or a Committee, in its discretion, shall deem relevant. The
             Board of Directors' and/or a Committee's determinations (to the
             extent authorized by the Company's Board of Directors) on the
             matters referred to in this Paragraph shall be conclusive.

         (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, at
             anytime during the period the Company's Common Stock is registered
             pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
             1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), the compensation Committee, if
             one has been appointed to administer all or part of the Plan, shall
             have the exclusive right to grant Options to Covered Empoyees as
             defined under Section 162(m)(3) of the Code, (generally persons
             subject to Section 16 of the 1934 Act) and set forth the terms and
             conditions thereof. With respect to persons subject to Section 16
             of the 1934 Act, transactions under the Plan are intended, to the
             extent possible, comply with all applicable conditions of Rule
             16b-3, as amended from time to time, (and its successor provisions,
             if any) under the 1934 Act and Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, as
             amended. To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by the
             Board of Directors or Compensation Committee fails to so comply, it
             shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and
             deemed advisable by the Board of Directors and/or such Compensation
             Committee.

5.       Terms of Options.

         Within the limits of the express provisions of the Plan, the Board of
         Directors or a Committee may grant either ISOs or NQSOs or SARs in
         tandem with NQSOs or SARs in tandem with ISOs. An ISO or an NQSO
         enables the optionee to purchase from the Company, at any time during a
         specified exercise period, a specified number of shares of Common Stock
         at a specified price (the "Option Price"). The optionee, if granted a
         SAR in tandem with a NQSO or ISO, may receive from the Company, in lieu
         of exercising his option to purchase shares pursuant to his NQSO or
         ISO, at one of the certain specified times during the exercise period
         of the NQSO or ISO as set by the Board of Directors or a Committee, the
         excess of the fair market value upon such exercise (as determined in
         accordance with subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 5) of one share of
         Common Stock over the Option Price per share specified upon grant of
         the NQSO or ISO/SAR multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock
         covered by the SAR so exercised. The character and terms of each Option
         granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Board of Directors
         and/or a Committee consistent with the provisions of the Plan,
         including the following:

         (a) An Option granted under the Plan must be granted within 10 years
             from the date the Plan is adopted, or the date the Plan is approved
             by the stockholders of the Company, whichever is earlier.

         (b) The Option Price of the shares of Common Stock subject to each ISO
             and each SAR issued in tandem with an ISO shall not be less than
             the fair market value of such shares of Common Stock at the time
             such ISO is granted. Such fair market value shall be determined by
             the Board of Directors and, if the shares of Common Stock are
             listed on a national securities exchange or traded on the
             over-the-counter market, the fair market value shall be the closing
             price on such exchange, or the mean of the closing bid and asked
             prices of the shares of Common Stock on the over-the-counter
             market, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the National
             Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board or the
             National Quotation Bureau, Inc., as the case may be, on the day on
             which the Option is granted or, if there is no closing price or bid
             or asked price on that day, the closing price or mean of the
             closing bid and asked prices on the most recent day preceding the
             day on which the Option is granted for which such prices are
             available. If an ISO or SAR in tandem with an ISO is granted to any
             individual who, immediately before the ISO is to be granted, owns
             (directly or through attribution) more than 10% of the total
             combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of the
             Company or a subsidiary or parent of the Company, the Option Price
             of the shares of Common Stock subject to such ISO shall not be less
             than 110% of the fair market value per share of the shares of
             Common Stock at the time such ISO is granted.

<PAGE>
         (c) The Option Price of the shares of Common Stock subject to an NQSO
             or an SAR in tandem with a NQSO granted pursuant to the Plan shall
             be determined by the Board of Directors or a Committee, in its sole
             discretion, subject to a minimum option price established from time
             to time under any state securities laws with respect to grants in
             such state.

         (d) In no event shall any Option granted under the Plan have an
             expiration date later than 10 years from the date of its grant, and
             all Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to earlier
             termination as expressly provided in Paragraph 6 hereof. If an ISO
             or an SAR in tandem with an ISO is granted to any individual who,
             immediately before the ISO is granted, owns (directly or through
             attribution) more that 10% of the total combined voting power of
             all classes of capital stock of the Company or of a subsidiary or
             parent of the Company, such ISO shall by its terms expire and shall
             not be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the
             date of its grant.

         (e) An SAR may be exercised at any time during the exercise period of
             the ISO or NQSO with which it is granted in tandem and prior to the
             exercise of such ISO or NQSO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
             Board of Directors and/or a Committee shall in their discretion
             determine from time to time the terms and conditions of SAR's to be
             granted, which terms may vary from the afore-described conditions,
             and which terms shall be set forth in a written stock option
             agreement evidencing the SAR granted in tandem with the ISO or
             NQSO. The exercise of an SAR granted in tandem with an ISO or NQSO
             shall be deemed to cancel such number of shares subject to the
             unexercised Option as were subject to the exercised SAR. The Board
             of Directors or a Committee has the discretion to alter the terms
             of the SARS if necessary to comply with Federal or state securities
             law. Amounts to be paid by the Company in connection with an SAR
             may, in the Board of Director's or a Committee's discretion, be
             made in cash, Common Stock or a combination thereof.

         (f) An Option granted under the Plan shall become exercisable, in whole
             at any time or in part from time to time, but in no event may an
             Option (i) be exercised as to less than one hundred (100) shares of
             Common Stock at any one time, or the remaining shares of Common
             Stock covered by the Option if less than one hundred (100), and
             (ii) except with respect to performance based Options, or
             performance based options which vest at a certain date in the
             future irrespective of whether or not performance is achieved
             become fully exercisable more than five years from the date of its
             grant nor shall less than 20% of the Option become exercisable in
             any of the first five years of the Option, if not terminated as
             provided in Section 6 hereof. The Board of Directors or a
             Committee, if applicable, shall, in the event it so elects in its
             sole discretion, set one or more performance standards with respect
             to one or more Options upon which vesting is conditioned (which
             performance standards may vary among the Options).

         (g) An Option granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the delivery
             by the holder thereof to the Company at its principal office (to
             the attention of the Secretary) of written notice of the number of
             full shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is
             being exercised, accompanied by payment in full, which payment at
             the option of the optionee shall be in the form of (i) cash or
             certified or bank check payable to the order of the Company, of the
             Option Price of such shares of Common Stock, or, (ii) if permitted
             by a Committee or the Board of Directors, as determined by a
             Committee or the Board of Directors in its sole discretion at the
             time of the grant of the Option with respect to an ISO and at or
             prior to the time of exercise with respect to a NQSO, by the
             delivery of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal
             to the Option Price or the delivery of an interest-bearing
             promissory note having an original principal balance equal to the
             Option Price and an interest rate not below the rate which would
             result in imputed interest under the Code (provided, in order to
             qualify as an ISO, more than one year shall have passed since the
             date of grant and one year from the date of exercise), or (iii) at
             the option of a Committee or the Board of Directors, determined by
             a Committee or the Board of Directors in its sole discretion at the
             time of the grant of the Option with respect to an ISO and at or
             prior to the time of exercise with respect to a NQSO, by a
             combination of cash, promissory note and/or such shares of Common
             Stock (subject to the restriction above) held by the employee that
             have a fair market value together with such cash and principal
             amount of any promissory note that shall equal the Option Price,
             and, in the case of a NQSO, at the discretion of a Committee or
             Board of Directors by having the Company withhold from the shares
             of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Option that
             number of shares having a fair market value of the Common Stock
             equal to the exercise price and/or the tax withholding amount due.
             Furthermore, a Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole
             discretion may provide for withholding as set forth in Paragraph
             9(c) hereof. In the event an employee is granted an ISO or NQSO in
             tandem with an SAR and desires to exercise such SAR, such written
             notice shall so state
<PAGE>

             such intention. To the extent allowed by applicable Federal and
             state securities laws, the Option Price may also be paid in full by
             a broker-dealer to whom the Optionee has submitted an exercise
             notice consisting of a fully endorsed Option, or through any other
             medium of payment as the Board of Directors and/or a Committee, in
             its discretion, shall authorize.

         (h) The holder of an Option shall have none of the rights of a
             stockholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock covered by
             such holder's Option until such shares of Common Stock shall be
             issued to such holder upon the exercise of the Option.

         (i) All ISOs or SARs in tandem with ISOs granted under the Plan shall
             not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent
             and distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of the
             holder thereof only by the holder. The Board or a Committee, in its
             sole discretion, shall determine whether an Option other than an
             ISO or SAR in tandem with an ISO shall be transferable. No Option
             granted under the Plan shall be subject to execution, attachment or
             other process.

         (j) The aggregate fair market value, determined as of the time any ISO
             or SAR in tandem with an ISO is granted and in the manner provided
             for by Subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 5, of the shares of
             Common Stock with respect to which ISOs granted under the Plan are
             exercisable for the first time during any calendar year and under
             incentive stock options qualifying as such in accordance with
             Section 422 of the Code granted under any other incentive stock
             option plan maintained by the Company or its parent or subsidiary
             corporations, shall not exceed $100,000. Any grant of Options in
             excess of such amount shall be deemed a grant of a NQSO.

         (k) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, an SAR
             which was granted in tandem with an ISO shall (i) expire no later
             than the expiration of the underlying ISO; (ii) be for no more than
             100% of the spread at the time the SAR is exercised; (iii) shall
             only be transferable when the underlying ISO is transferable; (iv)
             only be exercised when the underlying ISO is eligible to be
             exercised; and (v) only be exercisable when there is a positive
             spread.

         (l) In no event shall an employee be granted Options for more than
             200,000 shares of Common Stock during any calendar year period;
             provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this Section
             5(l) shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 8
             herein.

6.       Death or Termination of Employment/Consulting Relationship.

         (a) Except as provided herein, or otherwise determined by the Board of
             Directors or a Committee in its sole discretion, upon termination
             of employment with the Company voluntarily by the employee or
             termination of a consulting relationship with the Company prior to
             the termination of the term thereof, a holder of an Option under
             the Plan may exercise such Options to the extent such Options were
             exercisable as of the date of termination at any time within three
             (3) months after the date of such termination, subject to the
             provisions of Subparagraph (d) of this Paragraph 6. Notwithstanding
             anything contained herein to the contrary, unless otherwise
             determined by the Board of Directors or a Committee in its sole
             discretion, any options granted hereunder to an optionee and then
             outstanding shall immediately terminate in the event the optionee
             is terminated as a result of performing services for the Company in
             bad faith or has been convicted of a felony committed against the
             Company, or is terminated for cause, and the other provisions of
             this Section 6 shall not be applicable thereto. For purposes of
             this Section 6, termination for cause shall be deemed the decision
             of the Company, in its sole discretion.

         (b) If the holder of an Option granted under the Plan dies (i) while
             employed by the Company or a subsidiary or parent corporation or
             while providing consulting services to the Company or a subsidiary
             or parent corporation or (ii) within six (6) months after the
             termination of such holder's employment/consulting, such Options
             may, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (d) of this
             Paragraph 6, be exercised by a legatee or legatees of such Option
             under such individual's last will or by such individual's personal
             representatives or distributees at any time within such time as
             determined by the Board of Directors or a Committee in its sole
             discretion, but in any event within twelve months, less one (1) day
             after the individual's death, to the extent such Options were
             exercisable as of the date of death or date of termination of
             employment, whichever date is earlier.

<PAGE>

         (c) If the holder of an Option under the Plan becomes disabled within
             the definition of section 22(e)(3) of the Code while employed by
             the Company or a subsidiary or parent corporation, such Option may,
             subject to the provisions of subparagraph (d) of this Paragraph 6,
             be exercised at any time within six months less one day after such
             holder's termination of employment due to the disability.

         (d) Except as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or a
             Committee in its sole discretion, an Option may not be exercised
             pursuant to this Paragraph 6 except to the extent that the holder
             was entitled to exercise the Option at the time of termination of
             employment, consulting relationship or death, and in any event may
             not be exercised after the original expiration date of the Option.
             Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the
             contrary, such termination or death prior to vesting shall, unless
             otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or Committee, in its
             sole discretion, be deemed to occur at a time the holder was not
             entitled to exercise the Option.

         (e) The Board of Directors or a Committee, in its sole discretion, may
             at such time or times as it deems appropriate, if ever, accelerate
             all or part of the vesting provisions with respect to one or more
             outstanding options. The acceleration of one Option shall not infer
             that any Option is or shall be accelerated.

7.       Leave of Absence.

         For the purposes of the Plan, an individual who is on military or sick
         leave or other bona fide leave of absence (such as temporary employment
         by the Government) shall be considered as remaining in the employ of
         the Company or of a subsidiary or parent corporation for ninety (90)
         days or such longer period as such individual's right to reemployment
         is guaranteed either by statute or by contract.

8.       Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization.

         (a) In the event that the outstanding shares of Common Stock are
             hereafter changed by reason of recapitalization, reclassification,
             stock split-up, combination or exchange of shares of Common Stock
             or the like, or by the issuance of dividends payable in shares of
             Common Stock, an appropriate adjustment shall be made by the Board
             of Directors, as determined by the Board of Directors and/or a
             Committee, in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
             available under the Plan, in the number of shares of Common Stock
             issuable upon exercise of outstanding Options, and the Option Price
             per share. In the event of any consolidation or merger of the
             Company with or into another company, or the conveyance of all or
             substantially all of the assets of the Company to another company
             for solely stock and/or securities, each then outstanding Option
             shall upon exercise thereafter entitle the holder thereof to such
             number of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property to
             which a holder of shares of Common Stock of the Company would have
             been entitled to upon such consolidation, merger or conveyance; and
             in any such case appropriate adjustment, as determined by the Board
             of Directors of the Company (or successor entity) shall be made as
             set forth above with respect to any future changes in the
             capitalization of the Company or its successor entity. In the event
             of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or,
             except as provided in (b) below, the sale of substantially all the
             assets of the Company for other than stock and/or securities, all
             outstanding Options under the Plan will automatically terminate,
             unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors of the Company
             or any authorized committee thereof.

         (b) Any Option granted under the Plan, may, at the discretion of the
             Board of Directors of the Company and said other corporation, be
             exchanged for options to purchase shares of capital stock of
             another corporation which the Company, and/or a subsidiary thereof
             is merged into, consolidated with, or all or a substantial portion
             of the property or stock of which is acquired by said other
             corporation or separated or reorganized into. The terms, provisions
             and benefits to the optionee of such substitute option(s) shall in
             all respects be identical to the terms, provisions and benefits of
             optionee under his Option(s) prior to said substitution. To the
             extent the above may be inconsistent with Sections 424(a)(1) and
             (2) of the Code, the above shall be deemed interpreted so as to
             comply therewith.

         (c) Any adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock shall apply
             proportionately to only the unexercised portion of the Options
             granted hereunder. If fractions of shares of Common Stock would
             result from any such adjustment, the adjustment shall be revised to
             the next higher whole number of shares of Common Stock. No
             adjustment shall be made with respect to stock dividends or splits
             which do not exceed 5% on any fiscal year, cash dividends or the
             issuance to shareholders of the grantor of rights to subscribe for
             additional shares of Common Stock or other securities.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan, including, but not
             limited to, Section 5 hereof, an option granted under the plan of
             another corporation which either (I) sells substantially all of its
             and or its subsidiaries assets to the Company and or a subsidiary
             thereof or (ii) is merged into, consolidated with, or all or a
             substantial portion of its stock is acquired by the Company and/or
             a subsidiary thereof may be exchanged for Options to purchase
             shares of the Company's Common Stock upon substantially the same
             terms and conditions of the acquired company's plan. To the extent
             the above may be inconsistent with Section 424(a)(1) and (2) of the
             Code, the above shall be deemed interpreted so as to comply
             therewith.

9.       Further Conditions of Exercise.

         (a) Unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of an
             Option have been registered with the Securities and Exchange
             Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
             prior to the exercise of the Option, an optionee must represent in
             writing to the Company that such shares of Common Stock are being
             acquired for investment purposes only and not with a view towards
             the further resale or distribution thereof, and must supply to the
             Company such other documentation as may be required by the Company,
             unless in the opinion of counsel to the Company such
             representation, agreement or documentation is not necessary to
             comply with said Act.

         (b) The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common
             Stock until they have been listed on each securities exchange on

             has been qualification under or compliance with such state or
             federal laws, rules or regulations as the Company may deem
             applicable.

         (c) The Board of Directors or Committee may make such provisions and
             take such steps as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the
             withholding of any taxes that the Company is required by any law or
             regulation of any governmental authority, whether federal, state or
             local, domestic or foreign, to withhold in connection with the
             exercise of any Option, including, but not limited to, (i) the
             withholding of payment of all or any portion of such Option and/or
             SAR until the holder reimburses the Company for the amount the
             Company is required to withhold with respect to such taxes, or (ii)
             the cancelling of any number of shares of Common Stock issuable
             upon exercise of such Option and/or SAR in an amount sufficient to
             reimburse the Company for the amount it is required to so withhold,
             (iii) the selling of any property contingently credited by the
             Company for the purpose of exercising such Option, in order to

             adoption by the Board of Directors, or the date the Plan is
             approved by the stockholders of the Company, or such date of

             granted after termination of the Plan.

         (b) The Plan may from time to time be terminated, modified or amended
             by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
             outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote
             thereon.

         (c) The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time, prior to ten

             by such Board of Directors or the date the Plan is approved by the
             stockholders, terminate the Plan or from time to time make such
             modifications or amendments of the Plan as it may deem advisable;
             provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall not, without
             approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
             the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to

             shares may be granted under the Plan, or materially change the
             standards of eligibility under the Plan. Any amendment to the Plan
             which, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, will be deemed to
             result in the adoption of a new Plan, will not be effective until
             approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
             the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to
             vote thereon.

<PAGE>

         (d) No termination, modification or amendment of the Plan may adversely
             affect the rights under any outstanding Option without the consent

             granted.

11.      Effective Date of the Plan.

entitled to vote thereon within one year before or after adoption of the Plan by
the Board of Directors.

12.      Not a Contract of Employment.

Nothing contained in the Plan or in any option agreement executed pursuant
hereto shall be deemed to confer upon any individual to whom an Option is or may
be granted hereunder any right to remain in the employ of the Company or of a
subsidiary or parent of the Company or in any way limit the right of the
Company, or of any parent or subsidiary thereof, to terminate the employment of
any employee.

13.      Other Compensation Plans.

The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other stock option plan, incentive
plan or any other compensation plan in effect for the Company, nor shall the
Plan preclude the Company from establishing any other form of stock option plan,
incentive plan or any other compensation plan.

                expenses incurred by Lender in connection therewith (the
                "Examination Fee").

                (e) Paragraph 9 is thereby amended by adding the following:

                    "(g) Excess Cash Flow Prepayments. Within sixty (60) days
                following receipt by Lender of Borrower's annual audited
                financial statements, commencing with such financial statements
                for Borrower's fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, Lender may
                deliver a notice to Borrower requiring Borrower to prepay the
                Term Loans in an amount up to Fifty Percent (50%) of Borrower's
                Excess Cash Flow for such year. Any prepayments required under
                this section are strictly at the sole option of Lender, and are
                payable within thirty (30) days following the date of demand by
                Lender. All amounts paid pursuant to this section shall be
                applied to the Obligations in such order as Lender may elect. No
                Termination Fee or other form of prepayment premium shall be
                applied to any payment made under this Paragraph."

                (f) The following new Section 13(A)(vi) is thereby added to read
         as follows:

                    "(vi) DXI is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
                and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, is
                qualified and authorized to do business and is in good standing
                in all jurisdictions in which such qualification and good
                standing are necessary in order for it to conduct its business
                and own its property (other than to the extent that such failure
                to qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the
                business or financial condition of DXI), and has all requisite
                power and

<PAGE>

                authority to conduct its business as presently conducted, to own
                its property and to execute and deliver each of the Loan
                Documents to which it is a party and perform all of its
                Obligations thereunder;"

                (g) The following is added as a new Section 13(B)(v):

                    "(v) DXI has not, since its formation, been known by or used
                any other corporate or fictitious name, including, but not
                limited to names which were used by ProDen;"

                (h) The following is added at the end of Section 13(P):

                    "In addition to the locations specified on Exhibit A, it is
                acknowledged that DXI, until July 30, 1999, will have offices at
                13915 NW Third Court, Vancouver, Washington (the "Vancouver
                Location"). The Borrower represents and warrants that the
                Vancouver Location is used only until June 30, 1999 for office
                purposes and no Inventory is (or shall be) stored or located at
                the Vancouver Location."

                (i) Section l5(K) is deleted is in its entirety and replaced
         with the

                    "(K) Indebtedness. Create, incur, assume or permit to exist
               any Indebtedness (including Indebtedness in connection with
               Capital Leases) in excess of $450,000 during any fiscal year,
               determined on a consolidated basis, other than (i) the
               Obligations, (ii) trade payables and other contractual
               obligations to suppliers and customers incurred in the ordinary
               course of business, (iii) other Indebtedness existing on the date
               of this Agreement and reflected in the Prepared Financials (other
               than Indebtedness paid on the date of this Agreement from
               proceeds of the initial advances thereunder), (iv) the
               Indebtedness owed to ACG evidenced by that certain US $1,000,000
               promissory note of AFP dated April 17, 1997 (the "ACG Note"), and
               (v) the Indebtedness evidenced by the DXI Note."

                (j) Section l5(L) is deleted in its entirety and replaced with
         the following

                    "(L) Affiliate Transactions.

                    (i) sell, transfer, distribute or pay any money or property
                to any Affiliate other than Regam, or invest in (by capital
                contribution or otherwise) or purchase or repurchase any stock
                or Indebtedness, or any property, of any Affiliate other than
                Regam, or become liable on any guaranty of the indebtedness,
                dividends or other obligations of any Affiliate; provided,
                however, that if (A) no Event of Default exists and (B) no act
                or e\vent has occurred which, with the passing of time or the
                giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default,
                then Borrower may engage in transactions with any Affiliate
                other than Regam in the normal course of business, in amounts
                and upon terms which are fully disclosed to Lender and which are
                no less favorable to Borrower than would be obtainable in a
                comparable arm's length transaction with a Person who is not an
                Affiliate:

                    (ii) sell, transfer, distribute or pay any money or property
                to Regam, or invest in (by capital contribution- or otherwise)
                or purchase or repurchase any stock or Indebtedness or property
                of Regam, in excess of $50,000 each Fiscal Year, except on the
                following terms and subject to the following conditions: (A)
                both before and after having given effect to such sale,
                transfer, distribution, payment or purchase, no Event of Default
                exists and no act or event has occurred which, with the passing
                of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an
                Event of Default and (B) Lender shall have given its prior
                written approval for such sale, transfer, distribution of
                payment or purchase;

                    (iii) notwithstanding the provisions of Section l5(L)(i) or
                Section 1 5(L)(ii), Borrower may pay compensation permitted by
                Paragraph l5(J) to employees who are Affiliates, and may make
                loans or other advances permitted by Paragraph l5(B) to
                executives who are Affiliates. The Borrower may not make any
                payment to any Subordinated Creditor (including, but not
                limiting the generality of the foregoing, any payments on either
                the DXI Note, or any indebtedness of Regam) except as permitted
                by Section l5(N)."

                (k) Paragraph 15 of the Original Loan Agreement is amended by
            adding the following as subparagraph (N):



<PAGE>

                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
                Loan Agreement, until all of the Obligations have been fully
                repaid to Lender, Borrower shall not make any direct or indirect
                payment or prepayment in cash, property or securities, by
                set-off or otherwise, with respect to the DXI Note or any
                indebtedness of Regam without the prior consent of Lender which
                consent shall not be withheld provided (a) that the Borrower, at
                least fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed payment, delivers
                to Lender a signed certification (which will be relied upon by
                Lender) in a form acceptable to Lender, certifying to the
                benefit of Lender that (i) no Event of Default has occurred or
                is continuing under the Loan Agreement, and no Event of Default
                would result from the making of such payment, and (ii) according
                to the monthly financial statements submitted to Lender by
                Borrower, Borrower will have a Total Debt Service Coverage Ratio
                of no less than 1.1 to 1.0 and will be in compliance after
                giving effect to the payment with all other financial covenants
                set forth in the Loan Agreement, (b) the Lender verifying the
                accuracy of the foregoing certification of Borrower, and (c)
                Borrower shall have at least $500,000 in excess borrowing
                availability under the Total Facility after giving effect to any
                reserves required by Lender."

                (l) The provisions of Section 2(k) of the Third Amendment are
            amended and restated in their entirety as follows:

                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
                Loan Agreement, as long as (i) Borrower shall maintain excess
                borrowing availability of at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
                ($500,000), after giving effect to any requested but unfunded
                advance and payment in full of Borrower's suppliers to within
                sixty (60) days of such suppliers' respective written or
                agreed-upon terms, and (ii) there shall not then exist an Event
                of Default or any act or event which with notice, passage of
                time, or both would constitute an Event of Default, Borrower
                shall report to Lender Collateral information on a monthly basis
                (in the form of a Borrowing Base Certificate to be prescribed by
                Lender).

                (m) The provisions of Section 2(N) of the Third Amendment
            provided within sixty (60) days after the Third Amendment Effective
            Date, Borrower shall cause to be delivered to Lender a Subordination
            Agreement from ACG with respect to the ACG Note (the "ACG
            Agreement"). The Borrower represents to the Lender that it has used
            good faith and diligent efforts to obtain the ACG Agreement but has
            not been able to obtain the same. Relying on the foregoing
            representation, the Lender waives the requirement that the Borrower
            obtain the ACG Agreement. The foregoing waiver shall not be
            constituted as a subordination by the Lender of all or any part of
            the Loan to the debt owed to ACG.

         4. Waiver.

            (a) Based on the financial statements the Borrower has supplied for
         the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1999, the Borrower is in default
         of the covenants of Borrower contained in Section 14(Q) of the Original
         Loan Agreement. For so long as there is no other Event of Default by
         Borrower, the Lender agrees that the failure of the Borrower to
         conform, for the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1999, with the
         covenants contained in Section 14(Q) of the Loan Agreement shall not
         constitute an Event of Default.

            (b) The Lender acknowledges that the Borrower's execution of the ACG
         Note and DXI Note constitutes an Event of Default by Borrower of its
         covenants contained in Section 15(K) of the Loan Agreement. The default
         has been corrected, as of the Effective Date, by this Amendment. The
         Lender waives such default solely as it pertains to the ACG Note and
         DXI Note and solely for the periods prior to the Effective Date.

            (c) The Lender acknowledges that the Borrower has been in dispute
         with ProDen and Cade Adams regarding issues associated with the ProDen
         Purchase Agreement and that during the pendency of the dispute, the
         Borrower has not made payments under the DXI Note. The Lender waives
         any basis to claim that the failure of the Borrower, prior to the
         Effective Date, to make payments required under the DXI Note is an
         Event of Default or an Incipient Default.

            (d) The Borrower acknowledges that the foregoing waivers by Lender
         are limited to the specific periods, matters, and circumstances set
         forth in this Section. Nothing in this Section should be construed as a
         waiver by Lender of the Borrower's compliance with all other provisions
         of the Original

<PAGE>

         Loan Agreement (as amended thereby in or as a waiver of the requirement
         that the Borrower observe all other financial covenants contained in
         the Original Loan Agreement and to conform with Sections 14(Q) and
         l5(K) of the Original Loan Agreement for all other periods other than
         those specifically set forth in this Section.

         5. Reserve. From and after the date of this Amendment, in addition to
any other rights under the Original Loan Agreement, the Lender will thereinafter
reserve $600,000 from the borrowing availability under the Total Facility.

         6. DXI Note. The Lender thereby consents to the Borrower (i) prior to
the Effective Date, making a lump sum payment to ProDen of $150,000 in
connection with the DXI Note and the settlement of the dispute amongst the
parties; and (ii) after the Effective Date, making the payments contemplated by
the DXI Note.

The Borrower agrees to use good faith efforts, after the Effective Date, to
deliver to Lender a Subordination and Standstill Agreement by ProDen and Cade
Adams in a form and content acceptable to Lender.

         7. Amendment Fee. In consideration of, among other things, Lender's
consent to this Amendment, Borrower agrees to pay to Lender, upon Borrower's
execution of this Amendment, the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000) (the "Amendment Fee"). The Amendment Fee has been fully earned by
Lender and is nonrefundable and may be disbursed by Lender from the Total
Facility.

         8. Reaffirmation and Grant of Security Interest. Without in any way
limiting the provisions of Section 4(A) of the Loan Agreement, and to secure the
prompt payment and performance of the Obligations (other than those Obligations
arising out of the Environmental Certificate), and notwithstanding which entity
constituting Borrower receives a particular advance of the Total Facility, each
entity constituting Borrower thereby reaffirms the grant to Lender of or grants
to Lender, as the case may be, a security interest in all of such Borrower's now
owned or thereafter acquired or arising Inventory, Equipment, Receivables, the
Life Insurance Policies and the proceeds thereof, Trademarks, Licenses and
Patents, and General Intangibles, including, without limitation, all of such
Borrower's Deposit Accounts, money, any and all property now or at any time
thereafter in Lender's possession (including claims and credit balances), and
all proceeds (including proceeds of any insurance policies, proceeds of proceeds
and claims against third parties), all products and all books and records
related to any of the foregoing (all of the foregoing, together with all other
property in which Lender may be granted a lien or security interest, is referred
to therein, collectively, as the "Collateral"; provided, however, that, with
respect solely to Collateral of Regam, such Collateral of Regam shall in all
events include only property of Regain located in the United States of America
as of the Third Amendment Effective Date together with such Collateral of Regam
as thereafter may be located therein from time to time.

         9. Conditions Precedent. The amendments described in this Amendment and
the obligations of Lender set forth in this Amendment will not be effective
unless and until each of the following conditions precedent have been satisfied,
in form, manner and substance satisfactory to Lender:

            (a) Borrower shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to
         Lender the following documents, all of which shall be properly

            execution and delivery of this Amendment;

                (iii) A certificate of Borrower's president and corporate
            assistant secretary attesting to the facts that (A) the corporate
            resolutions set forth in Section 9(a)(ii) above have not been
            modified or revoked and remain in full force and effect; and (B) the
            by-laws of such Borrower have not changed from the date of the last
            such certification, or attaching any amendments thereto.

                (iv) Such amendments to Lender's existing financing statements
            and such new financing statements in Lender's favor as Lender deems
            necessary; and

                (v) Such other items as Lender may require;

<PAGE>

            (b) Lender shall have received a certificate of corporate status
         with respect to each Borrower, dated within ten (10) days of the date
         thereof, from the Secretary of State or other appropriate governmental
         authority of the state or country of incorporation of each Borrower,
         which certificate shall indicate that each Borrower is in good standing
         in such jurisdiction, together in each case with a certified copy of
         the articles of incorporation of each Borrower from such governmental
         authority;

            (c) After giving effect to this Amendment, there shall not then
         exist an Event of Default;

            (d) All the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties in
         the Loan Documents as amended thereby shall be true and correct, in all
         material respects, before and after giving effect to the making of this
         Amendment;

            (e) Lender shall have reviewed and approved a current UCC and
         judgment search on each Borrower;

            (f) Borrower has paid to Lender the Amendment Fee or in lieu thereof
         the fee has been paid to Lender by an advance by Lender against the
         Total Facility;

            (g) Lender shall have received a recent orderly liquidation value
         appraisal of Borrower's Equipment calculated at the lower of cost or
         market value, on a first-in, first-out basis, performed by one or more
         appraisers acceptable to Lender; and

            (h) Borrower shall have paid all reasonable closing costs, recording
         fees and taxes, appraisal fees and expenses, travel expenses, fees and
         expenses of Lender's counsel, and all other costs and expenses incurred
         by Lender in connection with the preparation of this Amendment, which
         costs, fees and expenses may be paid to Lender by an advance by Lender
         against the Total Facility.

         10. Indebtedness Acknowledged. Borrower acknowledges that the
indebtedness evidenced by the Loan Documents is just and owing and agrees to pay
the indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. Borrower
further acknowledges and represents that no event has occurred and no condition
presently exists that would constitute a default or event of default by Lender
under the Loan Agreement as amended thereby or any of the other Loan Documents,
with or without notice or lapse of time.

         11. Validity of Documents. Borrower thereby ratifies, reaffirms,
acknowledges and agrees that the Loan Agreement as amended thereby and the other
Loan Documents represent valid, enforceable and collectable obligations of
Borrower, and that Borrower presently has no existing claims, defenses (personal
or otherwise) or rights of setoff whatsoever with respect to the Obligations of
Borrower under the Loan Agreement as amended thereby or any of the other Loan
Documents. Borrower furthermore agrees that it has no defense, counterclaim,
offset, cross-complaint, claim or demand of any nature whatsoever which can be
asserted as a basis to seek affirmative relief or damages from Lender.

         12. Reaffirmation of Warranties. Borrower thereby reaffirms to Lender
each of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Borrower as
set forth in each of the Loan Documents as amended thereby with the same force
and effect as if each were separately stated therein and made as of the date
thereof. Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that with respect to the
financing transaction therein contemplated, no Person is entitled to any
brokerage fee or other commission and Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
Lender harmless against any and all such claims.

         13. Ratification of Terms and Conditions. All terms, conditions and
provisions of the Loan Agreement as amended thereby, and of each of the other
Loan Documents shall continue in full force and effect and shall remain
unaffected and unchanged except as specifically amended thereby. In the event of
any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Amendment and any of the
other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Amendment shall control.

         14. Other Writings. Lender and Borrower will execute such other
writings as may be necessary to confirm or carry out the intentions of Lender
and Borrower evidenced by this Amendment.

<PAGE>

         15. Benefit of this Amendment. The terms and provisions of this
Amendment and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and their respective successors and assigns,
except that Borrower shall not have any right to assign its rights under this
Amendment or any of the Loan Documents or any interest therein without the prior
written consent of Lender.

         16. Choice of Law. The Loan Documents and this Amendment shall be
performed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona.

         17. Entire Agreement. Except as modified by this Amendment, the Loan
Documents remain in full force and effect. The Loan Documents as modified by
this Amendment embody the entire agreement and understanding between Borrower
and Lender, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between said
parties relating to the subject matter thereof.

         18. Counterparts; Telecopy Execution. This Amendment may be executed in
any number of separate counterparts, all of which when taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument, admissible into evidence,
notwithstanding the fact that all parties have not signed the same counterpart.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Amendment by telefacsimile shall be
equally as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Amendment. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Amendment by
telefacsimile shall also deliver a manually executed counterpart of this
Amendment, but the failure to deliver a manually executed counterpart shall not
affect the validity, enforceability, and binding affect of this Amendment.

         19. Effectiveness of Amendment. This Amendment shall not be effective
until the same is executed and delivered by the parties thereto and all
conditions set forth in Section 9 thereof have been satisfied. The date that all
of the conditions set forth in Section 9 thereof have been satisfied is called
the "Effective Date."

         20. No Waiver. Except as specifically set forth therein, this Amendment
in no way acts as a waiver by Lender of any breach, default, Event of Default or
condition which, with the giving of notice or passing of time or both, would
constitute an Event of Default, of Borrower (whether known or unknown to Lender)
or as a release or relinquishment of any of the liens, security interests,
rights or remedies securing payment and performance of the Obligations or the
enforcement thereof. Nothing contained in this Amendment is intended to or shall
be construed as relieving any person or entity, whether a party to this
Amendment or not, of any of such person's or entity's obligations to Lender.
