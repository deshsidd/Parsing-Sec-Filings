                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a)  General Development of Business and Recent Events

     1. Introduction.

        Multigraphics, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware.  As used herein,
"Registrant" or the "Company" means Multigraphics, Inc., and its subsidiaries,
unless the context indicates the contrary.

        Registrant is a distributor of equipment, supplies and service to the 
U.S. graphic arts industry.  In the last twenty-four months, as previously
reported, Registrant has divested its Sheridan Systems and AM Multigraphics -
International business segments.   On May 28, 1997, Registrant's stockholders
approved a change in corporate name from "AM International, Inc." to
"Multigraphics, Inc." to reflect the name known to customers of Registrant's
sole remaining business segment, and to reflect the fact that the Company has
exited its international operations.
        
        On August 27, 1996, Registrant sold substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of the Sheridan Systems division, a leading supplier of systems and
components to both the printing and newspaper publishing industries, to
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG.  The sale included substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of Registrant's AM Graphics International Limited
subsidiary in Slough, England.

        The disposition of the AM Multigraphics - International business segment
has taken place in stages, as Registrant has divested its unprofitable foreign
subsidiaries as well as its 67% interest in AM Japan Co., Ltd.  In February,
1996, Registrant's AM International UK Limited subsidiary in England entered
into an Administration Proceeding, which resulted in the sale of certain
portions of that business.  In March, 1996, Registrant sold its Netherlands
holding company, including its subsidiaries in the Netherlands, France and
Belgium, to a local management buyout team.  In September, 1996, Registrant
sold its interest in AM Japan Co., Ltd., and on October 17, 1996, Registrant's
Canadian subsidiary initiated bankruptcy proceedings.

        All financial information has been restated to reflect the Sheridan
Systems and the AM Multigraphics - International operations as discontinued
operations.  Registrant is a distributor of an extensive range of equipment,
supplies and services to the graphic arts industry, having recently completed
the exit from the manufacture of equipment.  The majority of Registrant's
equipment, systems and supplies are sold under the Multigraphics(R) brand name.
To complement and expand its product lines, Registrant purchases additional
products from outside suppliers, which are sold either under Registrant's or
the producing company's trade names.

     2. Bankruptcy Proceedings.

        On May 17, 1993, Registrant and its subsidiary, Addressograph-Multigraph
Corporation ("AMC"), filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, in The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") case numbers 93-582 through 93-583 (the
"Bankruptcy Proceedings").  Registrant also filed on that date a proposed Plan
of Reorganization.  The Chapter 11 filing related to Registrant's domestic
operations and did not include its foreign subsidiaries.

        On August 26, 1993, a hearing was held by the Bankruptcy Court to 
consider approval of a Disclosure Statement to be distributed to creditors and
shareholders of Registrant.  After that hearing, and by Order of the Bankruptcy
Court dated August 26, 1993, the Second Amended Disclosure Statement
(hereinafter the "Disclosure Statement") was approved.  Further information on
the First Amended Plan of Reorganization as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto
(as so amended the "Reorganization Plan") and the disclosures made in
connection therewith, is available in the Disclosure Statement and the
Reorganization Plan incorporated herein by reference to Exhibits 28 and 10(A),
respectively, to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 1993, File No. 1-683.
        
        On September 29, 1993, Registrant's Reorganization Plan was confirmed by
the Bankruptcy Court.  In general, the Reorganization Plan provided for
distribution of approximately 7,000,000 shares of new Common Stock ("Common
Stock"), of which 97% was distributed to former holders of Registrant's 12%
Senior Subordinated Debentures, 2% to former holders of Registrant's $2.00
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock ("Old Preferred Stock") and 1% to
former holders of Registrant's Common Stock ("Old Common Stock").  The
Reorganization Plan also provided for distribution of 1,095,000 Warrants to
Purchase Common Stock ("Warrants") to former holders of Old Preferred Stock.
The Warrants permitted the holder to purchase an aggregate of 1,095,000 shares
of Common Stock until October 15, 1996 at an exercise price of $18.00 per
share, but have now expired and are of no further effect.  Under the
Reorganization Plan, general unsecured creditors are to be paid in full over a
period of five years with interest at 5% per annum unless they elected to be
paid in full under the convenience class (claims under $2,000) or unless they
elected before September 29, 1993 to receive Common Stock in lieu of cash.

        The Reorganization Plan became effective on October 13, 1993 (the
"Effective Date"). On the Effective Date, all Old Preferred Stock, Old Common
Stock, Old Warrants to Purchase Common Stock and Old Preferred Stock Purchase
Rights attached to the Old Common Stock were canceled and became of no further
force and effect except as evidence of the holder's entitlement to a
distribution under the Reorganization Plan.  All exchange rights associated
with the Old Preferred Stock and Old Common Stock expired on October 13, 1995.
For information relating to shares of Common Stock outstanding and shares of
Common Stock held for exchange as described above, see Note 4 of the "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" incorporated by reference into Item 8
hereof.  Also on the Effective Date the former directors of Registrant were
replaced.

     3. Events Leading to Bankruptcy Proceedings.

        Reference is made to Section D of Part III of the Disclosure Statement
(pages 22 to 29), incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 28 to the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1993,
File No. 1-683, for information on the general development of the business of
Registrant and events which led to commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceedings
on May 17, 1993.

     4. Corporate Structure of Registrant.

        Registrant, Multigraphics, Inc., was originally incorporated in Delaware
in 1924 as Addressograph Securities Corporation.  Registrant has had several
name changes, one of which was Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation for the
period May 6, 1931 to January 2, 1979.  Registrant's subsidiary,
Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation ("AMC") was originally incorporated in
Delaware in August 1972 as AM International, Inc. and changed its name to
Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation on January 2, 1979.  Until October 13,
1993, AMC was a wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant and was a holding company
for certain foreign subsidiaries.  Pursuant to the Plan, AMC was merged with
and into Registrant on October 13, 1993.  As noted above, Registrant changed
its name from "AM International, Inc." to "Multigraphics, Inc." on May 28,
1997.

(b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments.

        The information in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 12 to
the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" under the section entitled
"Geographic Segments" contained in the 1997 Annual Report are incorporated
herein by reference.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business.

        Registrant is a distributor of equipment, supplies and services to the
graphic arts industry, and has exited the engineering and manufacturing of
offset duplicating equipment and supplies to focus exclusively on  one
businesses segment, distributing equipment and supplies, and providing parts
and service, to in-plant, franchise, and commercial printers.  In the last
twenty-four months, Registrant has divested its Sheridan Systems and AM
Multigraphics - International business units in previously reported
transactions.  In December of 1996, Registrant and Xeikon, N.V. entered into an
agreement, as previously reported, pursuant to which the parties agreed not to
renew the distribution agreement under which the Registrant distributed and
serviced Xeikon digital color presses in North America.

        Registrant currently has approximately 650 employees in the United 
States and is headquartered in Mount Prospect, Illinois where, historically, it
has manufactured and distributed a broad product line of equipment and supplies
and provided services for the graphics arts industry through its own direct
sales and service organizations.  The Company's products traditionally have
included small offset printing equipment, automated copy/duplicating systems,
pre and post press products and supplies.
        
        Presently, the Company has completed its exit from the engineering and
manufacturing of offset duplicating equipment to focus entirely on distribution
of equipment, supplies and services to the graphic arts industry.  The Company
primarily serves in-plant printers and small to medium sized commercial
printers.  Declining market demand for the Registrant's traditional offset
duplicator products, due to inroads by alternative technologies, resulted in
the re-evaluation of its traditional strategy and the decision to exit
manufacturing and focus upon the distribution of supplies, services and
equipment.  The Company has licensed the rights to manufacture certain of its
offset duplicator products to Amergraph Corporation in Sparta, New Jersey, and
other products in other regions of the world, and therefore has available to it
and its customers a continuing supply of offset duplicator products.

     The supplies and equipment category consists of consumable products used
in the production of printed materials such as films, inks, plates, rubber
rollers, cleaning solutions and cotton pads, as well as equipment products such
as digital platesetters, presses, folders and cutters.  The Registrant tracks
various categories of these products, none of which accounts for more than 10%
of its revenues.  Similarly, no single supplier accounts for more than 10% of
Registrant's revenues.

     The service and parts category provides service to over 250 models of
printing equipment installed in in-plant and small to medium sized commercial
print shops.  The Company has 365 service representatives.

supplies and services in the United States, Canada and Japan for fiscal 1997,

     Registrant also manages a network of approximately 46 independent dealers
selling in approximately 44 countries.

        The principal customers of Registrant include in-plant print shops,
franchised and independent quick print shops, small to medium sized commercial
printers and governmental and educational institutions.  Registrant has
approximately 20,000 customers.  No customer accounts for more than 10% of
Registrant's revenues.

     5. Competition and Competitive Conditions.

        The Company operates in a highly competitive market in which price,
delivery and customer service are key factors.  The Registrant's customers are
in-plant, quick print and small to medium size commercial printers, and
governmental and educational institutions.  The market for small offset
duplicator presses, the traditional proprietary equipment of the Company, is
mature and continues to face competition from alternative technologies.
Because the installed base of offset duplicator presses has historically
provided a primary market for many of Registrant's services and supplies, the
Company is increasingly reliant on its general distribution capabilities in
continuing to serve its market segments.  Gross margins may decrease as the
Company seeks to add product lines through distribution agreements, joint
ventures and affiliations with third parties, and acquisitions.  To offset the
lower margins the Company has invested in information systems and has
undertaken other reorganization measures to increase efficiency and lower
expenses.

     The competitive market is also one of heavy regional competition, but a
consolidation of dealers and distributors is occurring, which results in a
consolidation of buying power and distribution cost efficiencies.  The
Registrant's investments in information systems, distribution outlets and other
capabilities enable it to both expand its business opportunities with existing
customers, and add volume through acquisitions.  Registrant believes that its
renewed focus on its traditional customers, the expansion of its product line,
and its strategy to make acquisitions in the graphic arts industry provide a
sound basis for growth.

     6. Cyclical Nature of Business and Liquidity.

        The revenues of Registrant are dependent upon trends in the printing
industry, which are a function of (among other factors) overall economic
factors and advertising expenditures.  Registrant's backlog is less than 5% of
annual revenues and is not a material factor in the conduct of the business.
Registrant believes that substantially all of this backlog will be shipped
during the 1998 fiscal year.

        Certain customers of  the Company require long-term financing for
purchases of equipment distributed by the Company.  Registrant cooperates with
various independent finance and leasing companies to provide such financing.
These agreements are sometimes on a partial recourse basis with remarketing
arrangements on a non-discretionary, non-priority basis.  Registrant has sold
identified pools of lease receivables and pools of rental equipment to
financial institutions on a limited recourse basis. The existence of such
financing is not, however, significant to Registrant's operations each taken as
a whole.

      7.   Research and Development; Patents and Trademarks.

           There were no expenditures by Registrant for research and 
development in fiscal 1997, $0.4 million in 1996, and $0.7 million in 1995.  
Registrant's research, development and engineering expenditures ceased when the
Company exited manufacturing of products.  Previous years' expenditures were
made primarily to maintain competitive product offerings.
        
           Registrant owns or is licensed under various patents and trademarks.
Registrant does not believe that its business as a whole is materially
dependent on any one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

           Registrant's principal executive offices are located in Mt. Prospect,
Illinois.  Registrant moved its corporate headquarters from Rosemont, Illinois
to its current headquarters in September, 1996, following the disposition of
Registrant's Sheridan Systems division.

           In 1994 and 1995, Registrant undertook the relocation of its AM
Multigraphics operations from its 700,000 square foot manufacturing and office
facility in Mt. Prospect to newer, more cost efficient facilities.  The project
consisted of three parts:  (1) relocation of the business offices to a 64,400
square foot facility in Mt. Prospect; (2) relocation of the distribution center
to a 79,700  square foot complex in nearby Arlington Heights, Illinois to
enhance the unit's distribution capabilities; and, (3) the sale of its former
Mount Prospect, Illinois facility for approximately  $6.8 million in November,
1995.  The Mt. Prospect and Arlington Heights facilities are leased until 2005
and are the Registrant's principal facilities.

            Registrant leases 15 additional distribution, sales and service 
facilities throughout the United States with total square footage of 81,900. 
Registrant believes that the properties and equipment included therein are well
maintained, in good operating condition and adequate for the current needs of
its operations.
        

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

             Reference is made to Item 1, Section (a) Paragraph 2, for 
information on Registrant's Bankruptcy Proceedings.  The commencement of the
Bankruptcy Proceedings resulted in an automatic stay of certain litigation
against Registrant pursuant to Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code as of May 17,
1993. Therefore, with certain exceptions, all legal proceedings against
Registrant pending as of May 17, 1993, will be resolved through the bankruptcy
process. Although the vast majority of the claims filed in the Bankruptcy
Proceedings have been expunged or resolved within the Company's reserves, a few
significant disputed claims remain pending in the Bankruptcy Proceeding. 
Registrant believes the resolution of these legal proceedings and claims will
not have a material adverse effect on the business or the financial position of
Registrant.

            Registrant has been notified of various environmental matters in
connection with certain current or former locations in  Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  Registrant believes that the legal
liability relating to such matters, if any, will either be resolved
consensually between Registrant and relevant governmental authorities or will
be subject to resolution through the bankruptcy process as with other disputed
claims.  Registrant believes the resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the business or the financial position of
Registrant.

            Registrant is involved in various other administrative and legal
proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability and general
liability lawsuits against which Registrant is partially insured.  The
resolution of these other proceedings is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business or the financial position of Registrant.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY  AND RELATED

     (a) Market and Other Information

         At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 28, 1997, 
Registrant's stockholders approved an amendment to the Second Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to change the Registrant's corporate name and to
reduce the authorized number of shares of all classes of capital stock the
Company shall have the authority to issue from fifty million (50,000,000) to
ten million (10,000,000), of which five hundred thousand (500,000) may be
issued as preferred shares.   Registrant's stockholders also approved an
amendment to the Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1 for
2-1\2 share reverse stock split (the "Reverse Stock Split") of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Registrant's Common Stock, with an increase of the
par value from $0.01 per share to $0.025 per share.
        
         Following the Reverse Stock Split and the change in Registrant's 
corporate name, Registrant's new Common Stock, $0.025 par value, commenced
trading on the American Stock Exchange on May 29, 1997 under the ticker symbol
"MTI."
        
         Registrant's Plan of Reorganization provided for the amendment and
restatement of Registrant's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.  The new
charter authorized 50 million shares of stock of which 40 million shares were
reserved for issuance as new Common Stock and 10 million shares were reserved
for issuance as new Preferred Stock.  On the Effective Date of the Plan, the
Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 7 million shares of new Common
Stock, $0.01 par value, to holders of claims and interests as described in Note
4 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained in the 1997 Annual
Report and incorporated herein by reference.

         On the Effective Date, Registrant also issued 1,095,000 new Warrants to
Purchase Common Stock at an exercise price of $18.00 per share which expired on
October 15, 1996, and are of no further effect.

         At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 8, 1994,
Registrant's stockholders approved the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
"Plan").  In conjunction therewith, an additional aggregate of 1,400,000 Common
Stock shares are available pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
Plan, subject to adjustments as provided in Section 6.7 of the Plan.  The
shares available under the Plan, as well as all awards thereunder, have been
adjusted to 560,000 common shares to reflect the 1 for 2-1/2 share Reverse
Stock Split effected on May 28, 1997.

         For information regarding quarterly stock prices for the Common Stock,

                                  ON SCHEDULE


To Multigraphics, Inc.:

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
consolidated financial statements included in Multigraphics, Inc.'s Annual
Report to Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have
issued our report thereon dated September 19, 1997.  Our audit was made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The
schedule listed in Part IV, Item 14(a)(2) is the responsibility of the
Company's management and is presented for the purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

                             AM INTERNATIONAL, INC.

                     EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

                                FISCAL YEAR 1997


I.      PLAN OBJECTIVES

A.      To provide competitive levels of compensation to enable AM
        International, Inc. (the "Company") to attract and retain the people
        needed to successfully manage the business.

B.      To provide a financial incentive for selected employees upon
        achievement of key performance goals, consisting both of financial and
        operating objectives set by the Management and Compensation Committee
        of the Board of Directors (the "Committee").

II.     POLICY

It is the Company's policy to pay base salaries and annual Executive    
Incentive Compensation Plan ("EICP") awards which are competitive and which
promote the objectives set by the committee for the plan year.

Under this policy, each participant's annual EICP award will be based on the
degree to which the Company achieves specific financial and operating goals.

III.    ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

In general, participants in the EICP are to be selected from that group of
employees whose activities are determined by the Committee to have significant
impact on business results and whose base compensation is in excess of $50,000
annually will be selected because many will have responsibilities which do not
have a "significant impact" on results.

Categories of participants will be established with target and maximum award
potential as follows:


<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Category              Threshold              Target              Maximum 
<S>                   <C>                    <C>                 <C>     
   A                             10.0                  40.0              80.0
   B                             7.5%                   30%               60%
   C                            6.25%                   25%               50%
   D                               5%                   20%               40%
   E                            3.75%                   15%               30%
   F                             2.5%                   10%               20%
</TABLE>

IV.     PERFORMANCE GOALS

Each participant will be measured based on the achievement of pre-established
financial goals: profitability, cash flow and revenue growth; and
pre-established operational objectives: completion of JBA system conversion and
the attainment of a customer satisfaction index as defined.  Goals (threshold,
target and maximum) will be suggested by the Chief Executive Officer and
approved by the Committee.
Performance goals for FY97, both financial and operational, are shown on
Attachment A.

V.      TARGET BONUS POOL









                                      1
<PAGE>   2
 
A participant's Target Bonus equals a percentage (generally 10 percent to 40
percent)of the base annual salary at the target level set by the Committee.
The Target Bonus Pool is the sum of the Target Bonuses for all participants.
The Target Bonus Pool is reached based upon satisfaction or attainment of
performance goals set up by the Committee.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary
depending upon the relationship of achievement of performance goals (for
example, profitability, cash flow) to target performance.

VI.     INDIVIDUAL AWARDS

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS PLAN, ALL AWARDS ARE
DISCRETIONARY WITH THE COMMITTEE, WHETHER PERFORMANCE GOALS HAVE BEEN MET OR
NOT.

The payout of individual awards shall be based on the attainment of the
performance goals set by the Committee.

A participant's share of the Bonus Pool will be based on the category or target
bonus set for the individual by the Committee and on achievement of performance
goals, unless the Committee sets other criteria.  Actual bonus payouts will not
exceed 200% of the Target Bonus.

VII.    DISCRETIONARY AWARDS

An amount equal to three (3) percent of the Actual Bonus Pool may be made
available for discretionary bonuses to non-participants in the Plan, but shall
be subject to the approval of the Committee.

VIII.   APPROVAL AND TIMING OF AWARD PAYMENTS

No participant shall have any claim or right to be granted an award under the
Plan.  The Plan may be amended by the Company at any time and from time to
time.  Neither the Plan nor any action taken pursuant to the Plan shall be
construed as giving to any  employee the right to be retained in the employ of
the Company.  Except as to otherwise provided herein, the Committee of the
Company's Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to interpret,
construe and administer the Plan including the right to adjust the amount
payable to you under any award to reflect any special circumstances that the
Committee deems relevant or to terminate it at any time.  All approved award
payments will be made not later than ninety (90) days after the end of the
award fiscal year, provided, however, upon receipt of a written request from
any participant delivered before the end of the year, the Committee may defer
payment for a period not to exceed one year.

IX.     COMMUNICATION

In order for the plan to be effective, it is essential that each participant
have a clear understanding of how the plan operates and that each participant
be informed of his or her inclusion shortly after the beginning of the plan
year.

X.      ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS AND PROCEDURES

A.      The Plan Year will be the same as the Company's fiscal year, i.e.
        August 1, 1996 through July 31, 1997.

B.      Current Awards

All awards will be paid in cash as soon as practical after approval (no later
than 90) days after the end of the award fiscal year).  The amounts required by
law to be withheld for income tax and Social Security taxes will be deducted
from the award payments.










                                      2
<PAGE>   3

C.      Eligible Participants and Salary

The salary of each participant on September 1 of the Plan Year will be used as
the salary of record for all calculations.  Initial calculations will be based
upon an estimate of September 1 salaries for those employees who would be
eligible for September increases, and would be finalized after the September
increases have become effective.

D.      Change in Status During the Year

1.      New Hire, Transfer, Promotion

A newly hired employee or an employee transferred or promoted during the Plan
Year to a position qualifying for participation may receive a pro rata award
based on the percentage of the Plan Year (actual months/full year times the
amount granted for a full-year award for that position) the employee is in the
participating position.

2.      Demotion

No award will be paid to an employee who has been demoted during the Plan Year
to a position not eligible for participation.

3.      Discharge

An employee discharged during the Plan Year shall not be eligible to be paid
for an award, even if his or her severance agreement extends past year-end.

4.      Resignation

An employee must be an active employee as of the bonus payment date to be
eligible to be paid and award.  An employee who resigns or is terminated prior
to the payment date will not be entitled to be paid for an award.

5.      Death, Disability, Retirement, Leave of Absence

An employee whose status as an active employee is changed during the Plan Year
for any of the reasons cited in the heading of this section may, at the
discretion of the Committee, be eligible to be paid for a pro rata award.

E.      Miscellaneous

1.      The Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to modify
the Plan from time to time or to terminate the Plan or to remove any participant
from the Plan.

2.      The decision of the Committee with respect to any issues concerning
individuals selected for award, the amount, terms, form and time of payment of
awards and interpretation of any Plan guidelines or requirements shall be final
and binding.

3.      By acceptance of an award, each employee agrees that such award is
special additional compensation and that it will not affect any employee
benefit, e.g. life insurance, savings plan, etc. in which the employee
participates except as provided in paragraph 4 below. 

4.      Payments of awards made under the Plan shall be included in the
employee's compensation for purposes of the Company's retirement programs.












                                      3
<PAGE>   4

5.      The receipt of an award shall not give an employee any right to
continued employment and the right and power to dismiss any employee is
specifically reserved to the Company.  The receipt of an award shall not
entitle an employee to an award with respect to any subsequent Plan Year.

6.      When a performance goal is based on income, it may be necessary to
exclude significant non-budgeted or not-controllable gains or losses from actual
results in order to properly measure performance.  The Committee will decide
those items that shall be considered for exclusion.  Examples are:

        a.      Any gains or losses which will be treated as extraordinary in
the Company's published financial statements.

        b.      Profits or losses of companies acquired during the Plan Year,
assuming they were not included in the budget and/or the goal.

        c.      Material gains or losses not in the budget and/or which are of a
nonrecurring nature and are not considered to be in the ordinary course of
business.  Some of these would be as follows:

                        - Gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real
                          estate or property. 

                        - Gains resulting from insurance recoveries when such
                          gains relate to claims filed in previous years. 

                        - Losses resulting from natural catastrophes, when
                          the cause of the catastrophe is beyond the control of
                          the Company and did not result from any failure or
                          negligence on the Company's part.

XI.     BASIS FOR DETERMINING MEASUREMENT OF RECOMMENDED AWARDS:


Award payouts will be determined upon attainment of performance goals set by
the Committee, which may consist of financial and operational performance
objectives.  Payments for the attainment of performance goals will be weighted
at the levels set forth on the plan summary attached hereto.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


     Employment Agreement dated as of April 10, 1997 between Thomas D. Rooney
(the "Executive") and AM International, Inc., A Delaware corporation (the
"Company") with its principal office at 431 Lakeview Court, Mount Prospect,
Illinois  60056.

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ the Executive as its President and
Chief Executive Officer, and the Executive desires to accept such employment,
upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and covenants contained
herein, the Executive and the Company hereby agree as follows:

                                  ARTICLE I
                                  Employment

     Section 1.01. Position; Term; Responsibilities.  The Company shall employ
the Executive as its President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 28,
1997 (the "Commencement Date").  Subject to the powers, authorities and
responsibilities vested in the Board of Directors (including any committees
thereof, the "Board") of the Company, the Executive shall have the
responsibility vested by the Company's By-laws in the President and Chief
Executive Officer.  The Executive shall also perform such other executive and
administrative duties for the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (not
inconsistent with the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company) as may from time to time be authorized or directed by the Board.  The
Executive agrees to be employed by the Company in all such capacities subject
to all the covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth.

     Section 1.02.  Duties.  During Executive's Employment hereunder, the
Executive shall perform faithfully the duties assigned to him hereunder to the
best of his abilities and devote his full and undivided business time and
attention to the transaction of the Company's business and not engage in any
other business activities except with the approval of the Board.  The previous
sentence shall not preclude the Executive from participating in the affairs of
any governmental, educational or other charitable institution so long as the
Board does not determine in good faith that such activities unreasonably
interfere with the business of the Company or the performance by Executive of
his duties hereunder.

                              ARTICLE II

     Section 2.01.  Basic Compensation.  As compensation for his services
hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Executive a minimum annual salary of
$225,000 (the "Base Salary"), payable in installments in accordance with the
Company's normal payment schedule for senior management of the Company, but
retroactive to April 10, 1997.  The Executive's salary may be increased from
time to time above the Base Salary at the discretion of the Board.  The
Executive's annual salary in effect from time to time under this Section 2.01
is hereinafter called his "Base Compensation".

     Section 2.02.  Incentive Compensation.  (A) Determination of Amount.  In
addition to his Base Compensation, the Company shall pay to the Executive as
incentive compensation ("Incentive Compensation"), in respect of each fiscal
year of the Company, an amount determined and payable in accordance with the
Company's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan or a replacement plan
established by the Board (collectively, an "Incentive Plan"); provided,
however, that the Executive shall be entitled to receive Incentive Compensation
on a pro rata basis in respect of any portion of a fiscal year during which the
Executive's employment is terminated other than as a result of a Voluntary
Termination or a termination by the Company for "Cause", provided that
Executive has been employed for at least one-half of such fiscal year.  A
"Voluntary Termination" shall mean the voluntary termination by Executive of
his employment with the Company.

     (B)  Manner of Payment.  Incentive Compensation earned hereunder shall be
determined by the Board pursuant to the relevant Incentive Plan.

     Section 2.03.  Stock Option; Bonus Stock Award.  (A)  The Company shall
grant to the Executive, effective on the date of execution of this Agreement, a
nonqualified stock option under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), pursuant to the Company's 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
"LTIP") to purchase 60, 000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal
to the closing price of the Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange on such
date.  The Company shall grant Executive an additional option to purchase
12,000 shares of Common Stock subject to such restrictions as the Company's
Board of Directors or appropriate Committee shall determine on June 11, 1997.
Such stock options shall expire ten years after their respective grant dates,
and shall become exercisable as to 33-1/3% of the shares subject to such
options on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of their
respective grant dates, subject to earlier vesting as provided in the LTIP.

     Section 2.04.  Severance Benefits.  If the Executive is terminated for any
reason other than "Cause," as defined below, or if Executive terminates his
employment for any reason, including death or disability, Executive shall
receive a lump sum payment equal to the greater of

Compensation at any time after the date hereof.  In addition, for a period of

accident, life insurance and long-term disability benefits as are made
available to Executive and his dependents prior to such termination;  provided,
that if Executive becomes eligible during the Severance Period to participate
in another group plan by reason of subsequent employment or otherwise, the
Executive's coverage under the Company plans will terminate in accordance with
the transition of coverage provisions in the Company's plans.  During such
Severance Period Executive shall also receive at the Company's expense
financial planning services, tax preparation by Arthur Andersen LLP,
Outplacement Services at a firm of Executive's choice, subject to Company's
reasonable consent, and a business or athletic club membership.

     Section 2.05.  Other Employee Benefits.  The Executive shall be entitled
to participate in all employee benefit plans and to receive all other fringe
benefits as are from time to time made generally available to the senior
management of the Company;  provided that if a severance benefit is payable to
Executive pursuant to Section 2.04 such benefit shall be paid in lieu of any
benefit otherwise payable to Executive pursuant to any Company severance plan
unless such plan expressly provides that payments thereunder will be made in
addition to the severance payments provided hereunder.  As of the date hereof,
such plans include a 401(k) plan, an automobile allowance program, an executive
universal life insurance program, membership in a business or athletic club, an
executive long-term disability plan, a supplemental executive health plan, a
supplemental executive retirement plan, and tax preparation and financial
planning programs.  In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to take time
off for vacation or illness in accordance with the Company's policies with
respect thereto established from time to time with respect to its senior
management.

Executive for all proper expenses incurred by him in the performance of his
duties hereunder in accordance with the policies and procedures established by
the Board.

misappropriation of corporate funds, other significant act of dishonesty or
illegality, willful refusal to perform or substantial disregard of the duties
properly assigned pursuant to Article I or significant violation of any

resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of
the entire Board of Directors of the Company called and held for the purpose

COMPARISON OF 1997 TO 1996

Net income in 1997 of $0.1 million ($0.04 per common share) improved
significantly over the net loss of $20.2 million from continuing operations in
1996.  The improved result in 1997 was primarily due to restructuring
initiatives which the Company formulated and executed over the past two years.
The plans have included the exit from unprofitable foreign subsidiaries, the
divestitures of non-core product lines, the exit from manufacturing, and the
implementation of strategic investments in new products and capabilities.

Revenues in 1997 of $88.7 million decreased by $79.4 million from 1996.  The
revenue decrease was primarily the result of: 1) the divestitures of foreign
subsidiaries in Japan and Canada which  accounted for a revenue decline of
$37.8 million, and  2) the discontinuance of certain unprofitable product
lines, including manufactured offset duplicator presses, which accounted for a
revenue decline of $35.0 million.  The Company is now focused on distributing
an extensive range of equipment and supplies and providing technical service to
in-plant printers and small to medium size printers in the graphic arts
industry.  The Company has completed the transition away from its historical
position as a manufacturer.

Gross margin decreased in 1997 from 1996 due largely to the lower revenue
level, however the gross margin rate of 28.0% in the current year improved by
5.6 percentage points over the prior year due to a more favorable product mix
and the elimination of manufacturing overhead costs.  Gross margin rates may
decrease, however, as the Company seeks to add product lines through
distribution agreements, joint ventures, affiliations with third parties, and
acquisitions.  To offset the lower margins the Company has invested in
information systems and has undertaken other reorganization measures to
increase efficiency and lower expenses.

Operating expenses decreased by $30.5 million in 1997 from 1996.  The decrease
in expenses were due to: 1) a $12.0 million reduction in selling, general and
administrative expenses which reflects improved efficiencies as the business
transitions to a distribution organization, and the reduction in corporate
expenses; 2) the elimination of foreign operations, which accounted for $12.5
million of the reduction, including a $2.6 million gain on the divestiture of
AM Japan Co., Ltd.; and 3) a reduction of $6.4 million in restructuring charges
as compared with the prior year.  Non-operating expenses decreased in 1997 by
$2.6 million due to the elimination in 1997 of borrowings under the revolving
credit agreement, lower interest costs on general unsecured claims, and
interest income which was earned on divestiture proceeds received in 1997 from
the sales of the Sheridan Systems segment and the Company's interest in AM
Japan Co., Ltd.  Net income of $0.1 million in 1997 improved by $20.3 million
over 1996 due to improved gross margin rates and lower expenses as described.

The Company has developed strategies to increase revenues through product line
additions, third party service agreements and acquisitions.  An increase in
revenue levels could improve profitability since the Company has infrastructure
and systems which are capable of absorbing a greater volume of transactions.

COMPARISON OF 1996 TO 1995

The net loss in 1996 of $20.2 million from continuing operations, or $7.19 per
common share, increased by $16.0 million over the $4.2 million loss in 1995.
(The earnings per share amounts in 1996 and 1995 have been restated to give
effect to the one for two and a half share reverse stock split which took place
in 1997.)

In response to a declining demand for manufactured duplicator products and
services, the Company developed a strategic plan in 1995 to transition from
being a manufacturer to becoming a broad based distributor of equipment,
supplies and services to the graphic arts industry.  The initial steps to
implement this strategic shift were undertaken in 1996 and included the sale of
the Company's major manufacturing, distribution and administration facility and
subsequent relocation of operations, which remain in the suburban Chicago area.

Revenues in 1996 declined $23.4 million from 1995.  The decline in revenues
occurred principally in the manufactured offset duplicating press, supply and
service product lines.  The decrease was due to a long term decline in market
demand for duplicator products due to inroads from competing printing
technologies.  The decrease in market demand has led to an erosion of installed
equipment and consequently lower sales of consumables and services to the
installed base of duplicators.  In addition, in 1996 the Company had
significant liquidity problems which led to a reduction in inventory levels
which in turn affected deliveries to customers.

The loss in 1996 was primarily the result of lower revenues, a decrease in the
gross margin rate as the Company shifted mix to lower margin distributed
products, and restructuring charges of $7.0 million to shut down manufacturing
operations, close the corporate offices and exit its unprofitable Canadian
subsidiary. Non-operating expenses increased in 1996 by $2.1 million due
primarily to increased borrowings under the revolving credit agreement.  The
net loss of $20.2 million from continuing operations in 1996 increased by $16.0
million over 1995 due to the factors cited above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (THREE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 1997)

The Company's total cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million as of July 31,
1997 increased by $7.8 million during the fiscal year following decreases in
cash balances of $10.0 million and $8.5 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Operating Activities

In 1997, the Company had a cash outflow of $15.6 million.  The 1997 cash
outflow was primarily due to a $10.2 million reduction in trade payables as
extended credit terms were reduced with vendors, and a $14.7 million reduction
in accrued liabilities primarily due to restructuring payments which included
payments for severance, accrued vacation and the settlement  of a lease
obligation.  A $9.0 million reduction in accounts receivable partially offset
other outflows and was due to improved collection rates, the collection of
receivables from the phased out manufactured machine product line, and a lower
revenue level.  Inventories increased $0.3 million in supplies and parts to
improve product availability.

In 1996, the Company had a cash outflow of $3.9 million which improved by $1.0
million over 1995. The net loss of $45.5 million in 1996 was largely offset by
a $26.3 million reduction in the net assets of discontinued operations,
primarily accounts receivable and lease receivables, and reductions in the
accounts receivable and inventories of the continuing business.  The inventory
reduction was the result of the phase out of machine manufacturing and general
reductions in stock levels due to liquidity problems.

In 1995, the Company's net outflow of $4.9 million was primarily comprised of
net income of $4.6 million, a cash outflow of $15.7 million in discontinued
operations due primarily to a reduction in customer advances on a lower backlog
of orders, and a favorable benefit from operating loss carryforwards of $8.0
million.  Fresh Start Reporting rules require recognition of tax expense
although the Company had no requirement to pay U.S. Federal taxes.

Depreciation and amortization of $1.8 million in 1997 decreased by $2.3 million
from 1996.  In 1996 an additional $2.0 million was provided against certain
manufacturing assets following the decision to phase out manufacturing.
Depreciation and amortization in 1995 totaled $2.3 million.  The Company's
fixed assets consist primarily of leasehold improvements and computer systems.

Investing Activities

In 1997 the Company received net proceeds of $50.6 million from the
divestitures of Sheridan Systems and AM Japan Co., Ltd.  In 1996 the Company
received $6.8 million from the disposition of property, primarily from the sale
of the Mt. Prospect, IL manufacturing and headquarters facility.  Capital
expenditures of $1.9 million in 1997 were to maintain facilities and to
complete the information systems upgrade.  Capital expenditures in 1996 of $9.0
million were primarily to acquire new facilities and upgrade systems equipment.
Capital expenditures of $2.4 million in 1995 were primarily to maintain
operations.


Financing Activities

In 1997, financing activities were a net outflow of $25.5 million as compared
with outflows of $2.7 million and $2.2 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.
In 1997 the Company repaid its outstanding balance under the revolving credit
agreement of $5.4 million with the proceeds from divestitures.  The borrowings
in 1996 were necessitated by operating losses.  The Company has made payments
of $5.3 million, $5.1 million and $4.3 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, to resolve unsecured claims and priority tax claims in accordance
with the Reorganization Plan of 1993.  In 1997 the Board of Directors declared
a $2.00 per share special dividend to holders of record as of May 13, 1997.
The dividend was paid on May 27, 1997.  In 1996 the Company received $4.0
million, primarily from capital lease agreements, which was utilized to fund
leasehold improvements and computer system upgrades.  In 1996 discontinued
operations had a $6.7 million outflow which resulted primarily from reductions
in long term debt and capital lease obligations.

The Company's primary source of financing is its $10 million three year secured
revolving credit facility which it entered into in May, 1997.  The Company
believes that its existing cash reserves and the liquidity provided by the
credit facility are sufficient to finance current operations and support future
growth strategies which may include the acquisitions of other regional dealers
or distributors in the graphics arts industry.

indicated, refer to the fiscal year.  Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to be consistent with current year presentation.

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  It is the
Company's policy to invest its excess cash in interest bearing deposits with
major banks and institutional money market funds.

Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, which includes
material, labor and overhead, determined by the first-in, first out (FIFO)
method, or market.

Properties, Equipment and Depreciation: Properties and Equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 30
years, primarily on a straight-line basis. The Company adjusts the net book
value to recognize impairments in accordance with "SFAS 121: Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived assets to be Disposed Of."

Currency Translation: Foreign assets and liabilities have been translated into
United States dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates,
and revenues and expenses have been translated at the average exchange rates in
effect during each period.  Translation adjustments are reported as a separate
component of Shareholders' Equity.  Exchange gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and are not material.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized from sales when a product is
shipped.  Amounts billed for service contracts are credited to Service contract
deferred income and recognized as revenues over the term of the contracts.  The
Company recognizes warranty and equipment installation expenses at the time a
product is shipped, if applicable.  The expense is estimated considering
current warranty policies and historical experience.

Research and Development Expense: Expenses for research and development are
charged to income as incurred.  Such expenses were $0 in 1997, $364 in 1996 and
$744 in 1995.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided based on the liability method of
accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
109, " Accounting for Income Taxes."  Deferred income taxes are recorded to
reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end.

Income per Common Share: Income per share amounts are based on the weighted
average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during
each period, and are adjusted for the reverse stock split discussed in Note 4.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements: In February 1997, Financial
Accounting Standard No. 128 "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS 128") was issued.  SFAS
128 specifies modifications to the calculation of earnings per share from that
currently used by the Company.  Under SFAS 128, "basic earnings per share" will
be calculated based upon the weighted average number of shares actually
outstanding, and "diluted earnings per share" will be calculated based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding and other potential common
shares if they are dilutive.  SFAS 128 will be adopted for the Company's fiscal
1998 year and all prior periods will be restated.  The adoption of SFAS 128
will not change reported earnings per share for the 1997, 1996 or 1995 fiscal
years.

In June 1997, Financial Accounting Standard No. 131 "Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131") was issued.  This
statement establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive
information about operating segments.  Under SFAS 131, information pertaining
to the Company's operating segments will be reported on the basis that is used
internally for evaluating segment performance and making resource allocation
determinations.  SFAS 131 will be adopted during the Company's 1998 fiscal year
and required disclosures will be presented for each year included in the
related consolidated financial statements.

In August 1996, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of the Sheridan Systems division for proceeds of
$50,100.  A loss of $15,212 was recorded in the fourth quarter of the Company's
fiscal year ended July 31, 1996 as a result of the transaction, with no
recorded tax benefit.

During fiscal year 1996 the Company completed the exit of its Multigraphics -
International subsidiaries with the sale of its subsidiaries in the
Netherlands, France, and Belgium and the placement of the Company's
Multigraphics UK holding company into an Administration Proceeding.  The sale
of the subsidiaries in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium required the
Company to provide consideration of approximately $3,000 in the form of cash
and other assets.  No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the exit of the
Multigraphics - International subsidiaries.

The results of operations, net of taxes, and the net assets of Sheridan Systems
and the divested Multigraphics - International operations are presented in the
consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.  Interest expense
pertaining to the Company's Revolving Credit Facility has been allocated based
upon the ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations to the
consolidated capitalization of the Company.  Continuing operations and
discontinued operations reflect the net tax benefit or tax expense generated by
the respective operations, limited, however, by the income tax benefit or tax
expense recognized in the Company's historical financial statements.  No
general corporate expenses have been allocated to the discontinued operations.
The results of the discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of
the results of operations which may have been obtained had the continuing and
discontinued operations been operating independently.

The net assets of discontinued operations included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at July 31, 1996 amounted to $42,940 and consisted primarily of
receivables, inventory, property and equipment, and intangible assets related
to the discontinued operations, and are net of accounts payable and accrued
liabilities.

The net assets of discontinued operations included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at July 31, 1996 is net of approximately $7,000 of liabilities that were
paid from the $50,100 sale proceeds.

In May, 1997 the Company entered into a $10,000 three year Revolving Credit
Facility (subject to borrowing base limitations) with Foothill Capital
Corporation ("Foothill").  The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $5,000
sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit.  As of July 31, 1997 the
calculated borrowing base was approximately $7,100.  As security for
utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company granted a security
interest and general lien upon all of its assets.  As of July 31, 1997, there
were no direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, but the Company
was utilizing $1,750 of the facility to secure outstanding letters of credit.
Interest generally will be charged at a spread of 1% above the reference (i.e.
prime) rate of Foothill and can be reduced in 1/2% increments in each of the
next two fiscal years if certain performance measures are achieved.  As of July
31, 1997 the reference rate was 8.5%.  Letter of credit fees are 1.5% per annum
plus issuance costs and processing fees.  The agreement contains restrictive
covenants limiting capital expenditures, restricting the payment of dividends
and other payments and providing for quarterly measures of working capital and
net worth, among other things.  In addition, the agreement limits the Company's
ability to borrow or to request letters of credit following a material adverse
change as determined by Foothill.  At July 31, 1997, the Company was in
compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility.  The Company is
operating its business with existing cash reserves and liquidity provided by
the new Foothill Revolving Credit Facility which, based on current projections,
are adequate  to finance current operations.

Through October 12, 1996, the date the facility expired, the Company maintained
a $25,000 three year secured domestic Revolving Credit Facility (subject to
borrowing base limitations) with BT Commercial Corporation and LaSalle National
Bank.  The Revolving Credit Facility included a $10,000 sub-facility for the
issuance of letters of credit.  As security for the utilization of the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Company granted a security interest and general
lien upon its domestic assets.  As of July 31, 1996 the Company had borrowings
of $5,430 under the Revolving Credit Facility and was utilizing $3,347 of the
facility to secure outstanding letters of credit.

In August, 1996 the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of the Sheridan Systems division for gross proceeds of
$50,100.  The proceeds of the sale were used in part to pay off all outstanding
borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility which expired in October, 1996 and
to temporarily cash collateralize approximately $2,300 of outstanding letters
of credit, which expired June 30, 1997.

NOTE 3 - BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS (CONTINUED)


On October 13, 1993 the Company concluded a reorganization when the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the Company's
Plan of Reorganization (Plan).  The Plan provides that holders of allowed
general unsecured claims receive cash payments toward satisfaction of the full
amount of their claims in equal quarterly payments payable on the last business
day of each calendar quarter ending after October 13, 1993 over a five-year
period, together with interest at 5% per annum.  Holders of priority tax claims
are paid 10% of the allowed claim together with accrued and unpaid interest at
8% per annum on the then outstanding amount on each anniversary of October 13,
1993 which occurs prior to the sixth anniversary of the date of assessment, and 
the  balances of such claims along with accrued and unpaid interest on the
sixth anniversary.  For financial reporting purposes interest on general
unsecured claims has been imputed at 9% per annum.  At July 31, 1997 the
Company had $1,233 of restricted cash which pertains to the settlement of
disputed claims in accordance with the Plan.

As of July 31, 1997, aggregate maturities of total debt, excluding capitalized
leases, are as follows:

Cash paid for interest was $1,647 during 1997, $2,282 during 1996 and $1,103
during fiscal 1995.


NOTE 4 - CAPITAL STRUCTURE

Prior to May 28, 1997 the Company's charter authorized 50 million shares of
stock, of which 40 million shares were reserved for issuance as Common Stock
and 10 million shares were reserved for issuance as Preferred Stock.  The Board
of Directors had authorized the issuance of 7,039,921 shares of $.01 par value
Common Stock.  Of these shares, 7,000,000 were issued upon the Company's
emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on October 13, 1993 (the Effective Date)
to holders of claims and interests pursuant to the Company's Plan of
Reorganization dated September 29, 1993.  In addition, the Company issued
Warrants on the Effective Date to purchase 1,095,000 shares of Common Stock.
The Warrants were exercisable at $18.00 per share and expired on October 15,
1996.  No  warrants were exercised prior to their expiration.

On May 1, 1997 the Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $2.00 per
common share, payable to holders of record as of May 13, 1997.  The dividend,
which totaled approximately $14,080, was disbursed on May 27, 1997.

On May 28, 1997 the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the Company's
Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation: (1) decreasing the authorized
number of shares of capital stock from 50,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares
with 9,500,000 shares being reserved for issuance as Common Stock and 500,000
shares being reserved for issuance as Preferred Stock, (2) changing the name of
the Company to Multigraphics, Inc., and (3) effecting a 1 for 2  1/2 share
reverse stock split thereby decreasing the number of issued and outstanding
shares of the Company's Common Stock to 2,815,337 (without giving effect to
elimination of fractional shares) and increasing the par value of each Common
share from $.01 to $.025 per share.  The Company has not issued any Preferred
Stock.  The Common Stock is not subject to conversion or redemption and when
issued is fully paid and non-

assessable and has no preemptive rights.  All references in the accompanying
financial statements to the number of common shares and per-share amounts have
been restated to reflect the reverse stock split and change in par value.

NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company received creditor claims during its bankruptcy proceedings which
the Company believes are duplicative, erroneous or exaggerated and to which the
Company believes it has valid defenses.  The Company has filed objections to
these disputed claims in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  As of
July 31, 1997 and July 31, 1996, disputed claims amounted to $8,205 and
$31,300, respectively.  The disputed claims are primarily comprised of
environmental and product liability claims.  Although the vast majority of the
claims filed in the bankruptcy proceedings have been expunged or resolved
within the Company's reserves, a few significant disputed claims remain pending
in the bankruptcy proceeding. 

The Company has been notified of various environmental matters in connection 
with certain current or former Company locations in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  The Company is also involved in various other 
administrative and legal proceedings incidental to its business, including      
product liability and general liability lawsuits against which the Company is
partially insured.

The disputed claims in the bankruptcy proceedings and the other legal
proceedings are in many cases in excess of recorded reserves.  At the present
time, it is management's opinion, based on information available to the Company
and management's experience in such matters, that the resolution of these legal
proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company has sold certain receivables related to machine sales, subject to
recourse provisions and repurchase provisions.  Management believes unreserved
exposures pertaining to these contingencies will not materially impact the
Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109.  At July 31, 1997 and July 31, 1996 the
approximate amounts of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
resulting from temporary differences and carryforwards were as follows:

The Sec. 382 ownership change which resulted from the 1993 bankruptcy
reorganization imposed a limitation on the usage of pre-reorganization domestic
tax operating loss carryforwards.  Usage of this loss carryforward is limited
to $3,689 per year or $55,335 for a period of 15 years following the ownership
change.  In addition, as of July 31, 1997 the Company had domestic tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $149,000 attributable to post-reorganization
periods and therefore not subject to limitation.  The domestic tax loss
carryforwards will expire from 1998 to 2012.  The AMT credit, although subject
to the Sec. 382 limitation, has no expiration date.

During 1997, the deferred tax asset decreased by $4,600 primarily due to
decreases in the Company's reserve balances.  Due to the uncertainty as to the
realizability of the deferred tax assets, the Company has established valuation
allowances in accordance with SFAS No. 109 to offset the asset.

To the extent the Company realizes a tax benefit as a result of future
reductions in the valuation allowance related to the utilization of
pre-reorganization deferred tax assets, fresh start accounting rules provide
for the reporting of such benefit by increasing Capital in excess of par value.
Although the future recognition of this benefit will have no impact on net
earnings, the Company will realize a cash benefit from utilization of the
"Pre-Reorganization Benefits" against any future tax liabilities.

NOTE 7 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION

Restated for the reverse stock split discussed in Note 4, as of July 31, 1997,
the Company's 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of
560,000 shares of $.025 par value Common Stock.  Options to purchase the Common
Stock are awarded at a price not less than 100% of the market price on the date
of grant, become exercisable at various dates generally from one to four years
after the date of grant, and expire ten years after the date of grant.  In the
event a holder of options is no longer employed by the Company, the unvested
shares are canceled upon the employee's termination and any vested shares must
be exercised within 90 days or they are also canceled.

* All 11,969 shares were issued as share awards and not as options under the
Company's 1995 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.

As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS
123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company has elected to
follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees" ("APB 25"), in accounting for stock-based awards to employees.
Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of the Company's employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized in the Company's financial statements for
all periods presented.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be determined as if the
Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to July
31, 1995 under the fair value method of that statement. The fair value of
options granted in fiscal years 1997 and 1996 reported below has been estimated
at the date of grant using the following weighted average assumptions:


                                1997     1996

NOTE 7 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)


Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's options
have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
options. The weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted
through July 31, 1997 and 1996 was $1.72 and $2.38 per share, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company's pro
forma information follows:

Because the Company anticipates making additional grants and options vest over
several years, the effects on pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123
are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of
future years. SFAS No. 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to
July 31, 1995.

On September 20, 1996 the Company completed the sale of its 2,148,000 shares of
AM Japan Co., Ltd. ("AM Japan") and received proceeds of approximately $10,600,
net of certain costs.  At July 31, 1996, the Company's investment in AM Japan
amounted to $7,698 and was reflected as "Net assets held for sale" in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.  This amount consisted primarily of accounts
receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and intangible assets, net of
accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  A gain of approximately $2,600 was
recorded by the Company in the quarter ended November 2, 1996, after providing
for expenses related to the sale.

On October 17, 1996, the Company's Canadian subsidiary filed for voluntary
assignment in bankruptcy.  Reserves for the cost to exit Canada, which had been
established in the fiscal year ended July 31, 1996, were adequate and no
additional costs were recognized.

On December 2, 1996, the Company and Xeikon, N.V. entered into an agreement
under which the parties agreed not to renew the distribution agreement.  The
distribution agreement provided for the Company to sell and service Xeikon
digital color presses in North America.  As part of this agreement, Xeikon
America, Inc. has acquired certain assets from the Company and assumed certain
responsibilities of the Company.  The divestiture of the assets resulted in a
net loss of approximately $500 which the Company recorded in the quarter ending
November 2, 1996.

During 1996, the Company had provided $7,032 to cover certain restructuring
actions to be carried out in 1997.  These restructuring actions consisted of:
1) $2,845 of severance and benefits associated with the termination of seven
employees, including three officers, in conjunction with approved plans to
close the corporate office and consolidate certain functions of the Company, 2)
$3,561 to write-off net assets of the Company's Canadian subsidiary in
connection with plans to exit this operation, and 3) $626 of facility closure,
equipment disposal, and severance costs associated with management's plans to
exit its manufacturing business.  These actions were substantially concluded in
1997.

The Company maintains defined contribution retirement plans for domestic
employees comprised of a savings plan (401(k)) and a profit sharing plan
(Retirement Accumulation Plan).  Contributions to these plans take the form of
(i) Company contributions to match a portion of employee contribution and (ii)
contributions made at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The Company's

plan.  The net periodic pension costs for this plan were $0, $308, and $291 in
1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.

In addition, the Company provides limited life insurance and health care

</TABLE>        


If the health care cost trend rates were increased 1% for all future years, the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation would have increased 2.9% at
July 31, 1997.  The effect of this change on the aggregate of service and
interest costs would have been an increase of 2.6% for 1997.  An 11% increase
in the health care cost trend rate was assumed for retirees under age 65 and an
9.0% increase for those over the age of 65.  These rates are assumed to
decrease gradually to 5.5% in the year 2001.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders and the
Board of Directors of
Multigraphics, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Multigraphics,
Inc. as of July 31, 1997 and 1996 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended July 31, 1997.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Multigraphics, Inc. as of July
31, 1997 and 1996 and the results of their operations and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended July 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
