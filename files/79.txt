                                AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Shareholders of United Dominion Industries Limited


We have audited the consolidated statements of financial position of United
Dominion Industries Limited as at December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders'
equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 1999
and 1998 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999 in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Restated (note 2)

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

                     (Amounts in Thousands of U.S. Dollars)


1.       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         General

         The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
         with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. These
         accounting principles are in conformity with accounting principles
         generally accepted in the United States except as indicated in note 14.
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
         and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
         date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and
         expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
         those estimates.

         Consolidation

         All subsidiary companies are consolidated and all significant
         intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
         consolidation.

         Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

         Cash and short-term investments include highly liquid investments with
         a maturity of three months or less.

         Inventories

         Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average or first-in,
         first-out) or net realizable value.

         Fixed Assets

         Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and
         betterments are capitalized; whereas, maintenance and repairs are
         expensed as incurred. Cost of property sold or otherwise disposed and
         related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts at the
         time of disposal and any resulting gain or loss is included in income.
         Depreciation of plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line
         method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The average
         annual rates of depreciation range from 4% for buildings to 10% for
         machinery and equipment.

         Goodwill

         Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value
         of net identifiable assets acquired, is amortized on the straight-line
         method over the expected periods to be benefited, generally 40 years.
         The company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset based
         primarily upon an analysis of undiscounted future operating cash flows
         from the acquired operations. Accumulated amortization was $90,309 and
         $69,044 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

                     (Amounts in Thousands of U.S. Dollars)


         Other Intangible Assets

         Amounts assigned to other intangible assets, primarily trademarks and
         patents, are based on independent appraisals and are amortized on the
         straight-line method over periods ranging from four to forty years.
         Accumulated amortization was $16,565 and $13,262 at December 31, 1999
         and 1998, respectively.

         Foreign Currency Translation

         The financial statements of those operations whose functional currency
         is a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars using the
         current rate method. Under this method, all assets and liabilities are
         translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates and income
         statement items are translated using weighted average exchange rates.
         The translation adjustment is included as a component of shareholders'
         equity; whereas, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are
         included in income. Foreign currency transaction losses totaled $2,768,
         $3,530 and $3,959 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

         Derivative Financial Instruments

         The company is party to certain derivative financial instruments,
         principally forward exchange contracts used to manage foreign currency
         exposures. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are
         recognized in revenues in the same period as the foreign currency
         transactions to which they relate.

         Fair Values

         The carrying values of cash and short-term investments, accounts
         receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
         fair value due to the relatively short periods to maturity of the
         instruments. The fair value of the company's long-term debt is
         estimated based on the current rates available to the company for debt
         of the same remaining maturities. Since the company's fixed rate debt
         carries interest rates which are different than current market rates,
         the estimated fair value of the company's long-term debt was
         approximately $634,000 and $621,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
         respectively.

         Earnings Per Common Share

         Earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income by the
         weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year
         (39,641,606 shares for 1999, 40,755,170 shares for 1998 and 44,439,004
         shares for 1997). The assumed exercise of outstanding stock options
         would not have a materially dilutive effect on reported earnings per
         common share.

         Reclassifications

         Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with
         current year presentation.

          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Restated (note 2)

                     (Amounts in Thousands of U.S. Dollars)


2.       Restatement Related to Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

         Effective January 1, 1999, the company adopted the Canadian Institute
         of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook Section 3465, Income Taxes.
         This adoption has been retroactively applied to all years presented in
         the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The adoption of
         this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Consolidated
         Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 1998 and it has not
         been restated. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the adoption of
         Handbook Section 3465 resulted in an increase in the gain on disposal
         of discontinued operations (note 3) and a related increase in net
         income of $3,086, or $.07 per share.

         For the year ended December 31, 1998, the adoption resulted in certain
         reclassifications related to the cost basis of various amounts in the
         Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The reclassifications
         resulted in increases in fixed assets of $5,515 and accrued liabilities
         of $5,174 and decreases in inventories of $468, other current assets of
         $288, goodwill and other intangibles of $1,344, other assets of
         $33,801, other liabilities of $24,109 and retained earnings of $11,451
         as of December 31, 1998.

         As of December 31, 1996, the adoption of Handbook Section 3465 resulted
         in a reduction in retained earnings and total shareholders' equity of
         $14,537 in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders'
         Equity.

         In 1999, the CICA amended Handbook Section 1580, Business Combinations,
         to allow for the separate presentation of goodwill amortization expense
         and goodwill impairment charges (collectively referred to as "goodwill
         charges"), net of tax, in the income statement. Accordingly, the
         presentation of income before goodwill charges, and the related per
         share amount, is also allowed. The company has adopted this
         presentation format and has reclassified the prior years' consolidated
         statements of income to conform with the new presentation. This
         reclassification does not affect net income or net earnings per share
         as previously reported.

3.       Acquisitions, Divestitures, Discontinued Operations and Restructuring

         Acquisitions

         In February 1999, the company acquired Riser-Bond Instruments which
         designs and manufactures cable fault locators principally used by the
         telecommunications industry. In July, the company acquired TKO Doors, a
         manufacturer of loading dock doors. In August, the company acquired
         Bran + Luebbe, a manufacturer of precision metering pumps, analyzing
         equipment and integrated blending systems for a broad range of process
         industries. In October, the company acquired S.W. Fleming Limited, a
         manufacturer of commercial side-hinged steel doors and frames. The cost
         of these and other smaller acquisitions totaled approximately $155,000
         and resulted in an increase in working capital of approximately
         $17,000, an increase in fixed assets of approximately $24,000, an
         increase in goodwill of approximately $129,000 and an increase in other
         liabilities of approximately $15,000.

                     (Amounts in Thousands of U.S. Dollars)


         In February 1998, the company acquired Radiodetection which designs and
         manufactures portable pipe and cable locators and related equipment
         used in the utility and telecommunication industries. In March, the
         company acquired Tex-Steel Corporation, a manufacturer of custom steel
         doors and frames for commercial and detention markets. In April, the
         company acquired APV Ice Cream, a manufacturer of industrial ice cream
         production equipment. In May, the company acquired Leading Edge, Inc.
         which manufactures ceiling fans, air curtains and air circulators
         supplied to the industrial and electrical distributor markets. In July,
         the company acquired C&M, Inc., a manufacturer of powered roller
         conveyor systems primarily servicing the corrugated and solid fiber
         carton industry. In August, the company acquired Ling Dynamic Systems
         Limited which designs and builds vibration test systems and related
         equipment. The cost of these and other smaller acquisitions totaled
         approximately $172,000 and resulted in an increase in working capital
         of approximately $27,000, an increase in fixed assets of approximately
         $14,000, an increase in other assets of approximately $1,000 and an
         increase in goodwill of approximately $130,000.

         In 1997, the company completed the purchase of the common stock of Core
         Industries Inc (Core). Core was a manufacturer of valves, strainers and
         backflow prevention products, agricultural equipment, electrical test
         and measurement equipment and integrated assembly systems used in
         automobile and other manufacturing applications. The total cost of the
         acquisition was approximately $302,000.

         If the acquisition of Core had occurred at the beginning of 1997,
         unaudited proforma consolidated sales, net income and net earnings per
         share in 1997 would have been $1,826,273, $144,422 and $3.25,
         respectively.

         In 1997, the company also made several smaller product line
         acquisitions. In January, the company acquired Lee Engineering which
         produces vertical lifting equipment used in various industrial
         applications. In March, the company acquired Trussbilt, a manufacturer
         of doors, frames and related products for the security and detention
         markets. In April, the company acquired Dominion Door, which produces
         steel doors, frames and pre-hung windows for metal buildings. In
         September, the company acquired TIF Instruments, a manufacturer of
         electronic test instruments used primarily by the HVAC market. In
         September, the company also acquired Process Machinery & Supply Company
         and Alliance Food Equipment Corp. Both companies manufacture and
         recondition equipment for the ice cream industry. In November, the
         company acquired Stow Manufacturing, a manufacturer of light
         construction equipment. The cost of these and other smaller
         acquisitions totaled approximately $68,000.

         The above mentioned acquisitions have been accounted for by the
         purchase method and earnings have been included in the results of
         operations from the dates of the acquisitions.

         In 1997, the company initiated a tender offer for the shares of Imo
         Industries Inc. (Imo). Imo's Board of Directors ultimately terminated
         the merger agreement and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the
         company received a $7,700 termination fee, net of expenses. This amount
         is included in "Other income (expense)" in the Consolidated Statements
         of Income.

         Divestitures (other than Discontinued Operations)

         In January 1998, the company sold its Little Falls Tank division of
         Waukesha Cherry-Burrell for approximately $4,000 which equaled its book
         value. In December 1998, the company sold the assets of its Marley Pump
         motor product line and entered into various consulting and supply
         arrangements for total proceeds of $17,500. The company recognized a
         pre-tax gain on the sale of $11,285 which is included in "Other income
         (expense)" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

         Discontinued Operations

         In 1997, the company sold Varco-Pruden, Centria and Windsor Door. These
         units were part of the company's Building Products segment. The company
         received approximately $240,000 in cash and recorded a net-of-tax gain
         of $53,086 on the sale of these businesses. The results of operations
         of these units and the related gain on sale have been separately
         classified as "Income from discontinued operations" in the Consolidated
         Statements of Income. The operating cash flows from these businesses
         have also been separately classified in the Consolidated Statements of
         Cash Flows. The "Cash used by discontinued operations" in the
         Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 1997 also includes
         approximately $44,000 in income tax payments which were directly
         related to the gain on the sale of discontinued operations.

         In 1999 and 1998, the company incurred charges of $1,500 and $6,852,
         respectively, related primarily to the settlement of legal claims and
         the write-down of assets to be realized from prior years' divestiture
         activities to their estimated net realizable value. These charges are
         included in "Other income (expense)" in the Consolidated Statements of
         Income.

         Restructuring Charges

         In 1998, the company announced a company-wide cost reduction plan. The
         plan included the net reduction of its global workforce by over 500
         positions, principally administrative personnel, rationalizations
         involving 12 facilities and reduced discretionary spending. The company
         recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings in 1998 of $16,336 related to the
         plan.

         The company expanded the restructuring program in 1999 to include the
         rationalization of 11 additional facilities including the shutdown of
         four manufacturing and one administrative facility, the transition of
         the manufacturing of several product lines to different sites and the
         discontinuation of several unprofitable product lines. Additional
         workforce reductions of approximately 500 positions were announced of
         which approximately 130 had actually been terminated by December 31,
         1999. The company reported a pre-tax charge to earnings of $22,198
         related to these new initiatives.

         Selected financial information relating to the two years' restructuring
         charges is as follows:

         All costs are included in "Restructuring charges" in the Consolidated
         Statements of Income with the exception of $1,694 of goodwill
         impairment charges which were recorded in 1999 and are included in
         "Goodwill charges". Of the total charges, $7,399 remains accrued at
         December 31, 1999. The majority of the remaining restructuring
         activities should be completed during the first half of 2000.

         Subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation
         allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1999 will be
         allocated to goodwill. Based on the company's historical and current
         earnings, management believes it is more likely than not that the
         company will realize the benefit of the remaining deferred tax assets
         that are not subject to the valuation allowance.

</TABLE>

         The company has a revolving credit agreement (revolver) with a group of
         banks. This agreement gives the company the ability to borrow up to
         $450,000 through July 2002. Borrowings under the revolver are available
         in U.S. dollars and Deutsche Marks (DM) at the U.S. prime interest rate
         or LIBOR plus a margin. The margin ranges from 0.170% to 0.325% and is
         determined by a leverage ratio and the amount of utilization under the
         credit facility. The weighted average interest rates on the borrowings
         under this agreement were 4.6% and 4.9% during 1999 and 1998,
         respectively. At December 31, 1999, $41,192 of the revolver borrowings
         were denominated in DM. The DM borrowings are designated as a hedge of
         the company's net investment in German subsidiaries and foreign
         exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are reflected in "Equity
         adjustment from foreign currency translation" in the Consolidated
         Statements of Financial Position. The company also pays an annual
         facility fee on the amount of this facility ranging from 0.080% to
         0.125%, depending upon a leverage ratio. The company further pays an
         annual utilization fee on the amount of loans outstanding of up to
         0.05%, depending on leverage and amount of utilization. At December 31,
         1999, the margin, facility fee and utilization fee were 0.25%, 0.1% and
         0%, respectively.

         The 6.80% senior notes are currently payable in annual installments of
         $23,400. The 8.25% senior notes are currently payable in annual
         installments of $12,500. The 7.67% senior notes are payable in annual
         installments of $10,000 beginning in 2003. The 6.64% senior notes are
         payable in full in 2008.

          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Restated (note 2)

                     (Amounts in Thousands of U.S. Dollars)


         During 1998, the company entered into an open-ended program whereby up
         to Cdn $250,000 of commercial paper can be issued. While the commercial
         paper is typically due in 30 - 60 days, with a maximum maturity of one
         year, it is the company's intention to continually refinance these
         borrowings. The company maintains unutilized long-term committed credit
         facilities sufficient to refinance the commercial paper outstanding.
         Therefore, the amounts outstanding at December 31, 1999 (U.S. $172,470)
         are included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of
         Financial Position. Interest rates on the commercial paper ranged from
         5.1% to 5.7% with a weighted average of 5.3% in 1999.

         The company has a $40,000 multi-currency revolving credit agreement
         with a bank which expires in June 2000. The agreement allows the
         company to designate subsidiaries to borrow under the facility at LIBOR
         interest rates plus margin and facility fees in total ranging from 0.7%
         to 1.0%. At December 31, 1999, $36,375 had been borrowed under this
         facility. This amount is included in long-term debt since the company
         has the capacity and intention to refinance this facility and extend
         its term prior to the expiration of the agreement.

         At December 31, 1999, the company had available approximately $150,000
         of unused long-term revolving credit commitments.

         Various loan agreements contain covenants with respect to net worth,
         indebtedness and other items. The company has complied with all
         provisions of these agreements at December 31, 1999.

         Future principal payments on long-term debt are as follows:

       The restricted stock issued during 1999 had a fair value at the date of
       grant of $2,263 or U.S. $19.99 per share. The sale of this stock is
       restricted for six years from the date of grant. Restricted stock was
       also issued during 1996 which is restricted for periods up to five years
       from the date of the grant. Compensation expense related to all
       restricted shares is recorded over the restriction period and amounted to
       $1,204, $1,984 and $1,406 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

       The company's management incentive plans contain a feature that allows
       participants the opportunity to elect to receive restricted common shares
       in lieu of a portion of their cash bonuses. The number of shares issued
       is increased by a multiple in order to provide participants an incentive
       to elect to receive shares. A total of 55,365 and 43,845 shares were
       issued in 1999 and 1998, respectively, to participants who made such
       share elections.

10.    Benefit Plans

       The company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans
       covering approximately one half of all employees. Plans covering eligible
       salaried employees call for benefits to be paid at retirement based
       primarily upon years of service and their compensation rates near
       retirement. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of
       stated amounts for each year of service. Contributions to the plans
       reflect benefits attributed to employees' services to date and also for
       benefits expected to be earned in the future. Assets of the plans consist
       primarily of cash and cash equivalents, common and preferred stocks,
       government bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds and other fixed income
       investments. The company also provides, through non-qualified plans,
       supplemental pension payments in excess of the qualified plan limits
       imposed by income tax regulations. These non-qualified plans are
       unfunded.

       A number of the company's operating units have defined contribution plans
       pursuant to Section 401(k) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The total
       expense of these plans was $5,522, $5,475 and $3,893 for the years ended
       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

       The company's German operations have pension plans, which in accordance
       with applicable laws, are unfunded. The weighted average discount rate
       used to measure the projected benefit obligation of the German plans is
       6% - 7% and the rate of increase in future compensation levels is 3% -
       3.5% for 1999 and 1998.

       The status of the German plans at December 31, 1999 and 1998 as

          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Restated (note 2)

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

                     (Amounts in Thousands of U.S. Dollars)

       The company provides certain postretirement health care and life
       insurance benefits to a limited number of employees. The costs associated
       with these benefits are not significant and are recorded on a
       "pay-as-you-go" or cash basis.

11.    Commitments and Contingencies

       A number of claims and lawsuits seeking unspecified damages and other
       relief are pending against the company. It is impossible at this time for
       the company to predict with any certainty the outcome of such litigation.
       However, management is of the opinion, based upon information presently
       available, that it is unlikely that any liability, to the extent not
       provided for through insurance or otherwise, would be material in
       relation to the company's consolidated financial position.

       The company has been named along with several other parties in a number
       of administrative proceedings maintained by federal and state agencies
       arising out of alleged releases or contributions of hazardous substances
       into the environment. None of the proceedings is, in the opinion of
       management, either individually or viewed in connection with all the
       proceedings, material to the company's liquidity, consolidated operating
       results, or consolidated financial position. While the company has
       participated and in the future will participate in the funding of clean
       up costs in connection with certain of the proceedings, it does not
       believe that material monetary sanctions will be imposed against it as a
       result of any of the proceedings.

       The company has an agreement to sell certain qualifying accounts
       receivable to a financial institution on a revolving basis. The amount
       sold as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 was $62,900 and $62,000,
       respectively. The amount sold at any time must be supported by available
       credit under the revolver. Certain of the company's operations have
       entered into agreements with third party finance companies to provide
       wholesale financing of their product to distributors. The company is
       responsible for the repurchase of new product in the event it is acquired
       by the finance companies through repossession. At December 31, 1999, the
       total amount of new product financed under these agreements is
       approximately $12,000. At December 31, 1999, the company also has sold
       approximately $8,000 of receivables under recourse agreements. Reserves
       have been provided for any anticipated losses under these agreements.

       In the normal course of business, letters of credit and bank guarantees
       are issued by banks for account of the company, which in the opinion of
       management, have no material effect on the company's financial position.
       At December 31, 1999, the company was contingently liable for $84,000
       under these arrangements.

       The company does not trade in financial instruments and does not engage
       in speculation. However, it does enter into a limited range and number of
       derivative financial instrument contracts. The company also has a program
       in place to manage foreign currency risk. As part of that program, the
       company has entered into a limited number of foreign currency forward
       exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions or intercompany
       loan payments. The company's foreign exchange contracts do not subject
       the company to risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and
       losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the transactions
       being hedged. As of December 31, 1999, the company's German operations
       had approximately DM 183 million ($93,000) of forward exchange contracts
       outstanding which are designed to convert the receipt of foreign
       currencies from sales outside of Germany into DM. The forward exchange
       contracts generally have maturities which do not exceed one year and
       exchange rates are agreed to at the inception of the contracts.

13.    Year 2000

       The Year 2000 Issue arises because many computerized systems use two
       digits rather than four to identify a year. Date-sensitive systems may
       recognize the year 2000 as 1900 or some other date, resulting in errors
       when information using year 2000 dates is processed. Although the change
       in date has occurred, it is not possible to conclude that all aspects of
       the Year 2000 Issue that may affect the company, including those related
       to customers, suppliers, or other third parties, have been fully
       resolved.

14.    Differences Between Canadian and United States Accounting Principles

       United States Accounting Differences

       Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in Canada allow for the
       reduction of stated capital of outstanding common shares with a
       corresponding offset to deficit. This reclassification, which the
       company made in 1990, is not permitted by United States GAAP and would
       result in an increase in capital stock and a reduction in retained
       earnings at December 31, 1999 and 1998 of $128,093. Canadian GAAP also
       permits expenses related to the issue of capital stock, net of income
       taxes, to be deducted from retained earnings while United States GAAP
       requires such expenses to be deducted from the proceeds of stock
       issuances credited to capital stock. This reclassification would reduce
       capital stock and increase retained earnings by $20,905 at December 31,
       1999 and 1998.

       The CICA recently adopted a new standard for recognizing the cost of
       pensions and other postretirement benefits (Handbook Section 3461). The
       new standard, effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1,
       2000, essentially harmonizes Canadian rules with United States GAAP and
       requires accruing the cost of providing postretirement health care
       benefits during the years that the employee renders the necessary
       service. The company currently records health care benefits on a
       "pay-as-you-go" basis for benefits paid on behalf of active and retired
       employees. The healthcare benefit obligations not recorded by the
       company for active and retired employees due to use of the
       "pay-as-you-go" basis versus accrual accounting totaled approximately
       $12,000 at December 31, 1999. Additionally, CICA Handbook Section 3461
       requires that for purposes of determining the pension liability, the
       discount rate must be based on current bond market yields rather than
       management's best estimate of the plan's long-term returns. This change
       in the discount rate will increase the volatility of pension expense in
       the future and create an additional pension liability of approximately
       $16,000 which will need to be recorded upon adoption of this new
       accounting standard. The company intends to retroactively adopt CICA
       Handbook Section 3461 in the first quarter of 2000. After tax effecting
       the above amounts, these changes will result in increases to other
       assets of approximately $3,000 and accrued liabilities of approximately
       $7,000 and decreases to other (non-current) assets of approximately
       $16,000, other (non-current) liabilities of approximately $3,000 and
       retained earnings of approximately $17,000.

       Canadian GAAP allows for the capitalization and subsequent amortization
       of start-up costs for new facilities and joint ventures. Effective
       January 1, 1999, United States GAAP requires the expensing of these
       costs as incurred as well as the expensing of any previously capitalized
       costs. As of December 31, 1999, United States GAAP would require the
       company to expense approximately $729, net of tax, of unamortized costs
       that had been capitalized in prior years.

       The income statement format adopted in 1999 by the company as permitted
       by CICA Handbook Section 1580, Business Combinations (note 2) is not
       allowed under United States GAAP. Presentation under United States GAAP
       requires that the gross goodwill charges be included as a component of
       operating income and the associated income tax benefit be included as a
       component of the income tax provision. This reclassification does not
       affect reported net income.

       United States GAAP requires the dual presentation of basic and diluted
       earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed
       exercise of dilutive securities such as the company's stock options.

       The following table reflects the impact on net income, weighted average
       shares outstanding and net earnings per share of complying with United
       States GAAP as it pertains to the items noted above.

       The application of United States GAAP previously discussed would result
       in increases in other (non-current) liabilities of approximately $5,000
       and common shares of approximately $107,000 and decreases in goodwill of
       approximately $2,000, other (non-current) assets of approximately
       $6,000, accrued liabilities of approximately $1000, and retained
       earnings of approximately $119,000 as of December 31, 1999. At December
       31, 1998, the application of United States GAAP would result in
       increases in accrued liabilities of approximately $2,000, other
       (non-current) liabilities of approximately $5,000 and common shares of
       approximately $107,000 and decreases in goodwill of approximately $2,000
       and retained earnings of approximately $116,000.

       Additional United States Disclosure Requirements

       The company's accounting for stock options is essentially the same as
       the intrinsic value method prescribed by existing accounting
       pronouncements effective in the United States. United States GAAP
       encourages, but does not require companies to record compensation cost
       for stock option plans at fair value and requires the disclosure of
       proforma net income and earnings per share information as if the company
       had accounted for its employee stock options issued beginning in 1995
       under the fair value method. Accordingly, the fair value of the options
       issued have been estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
       option pricing model with the following assumptions for 1999, 1998 and
       1997, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 5.2%, 5.1% and 6.2%;
       dividend yields of 1.8%, 1.6% and 1.0%; volatility factors of the
       expected market price of the company's common stock of .37, .39 and .33;
       and a weighted-average expected life of the options of eight years. The
       weighted-average grant-date fair values of options issued in 1999, 1998
       and 1997 was $8.28, $12.60 and $12.43, respectively. For purposes of
       proforma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is
       amortized to expense over the options' vesting period that ranges from
       six months to three years. Retroactive application of the fair value
       method to prior years is not permitted, therefore the full effect of the
       fair value method will not be reflected in the proforma disclosures
       until it has been applied to all nonvested options. Assuming the company
       had accounted for its stock options issued under the fair value method,
       United States GAAP proforma net income and basic and diluted earnings
       per share for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 would
       have been $82,556, $2.09 and $2.07; $94,134, $2.32 and $2.29; and
       $136,508, $3.09 and $3.05, respectively.

       United Dominion Industries Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary,
       United Dominion Holdings, Inc., are guarantors of certain senior debt
       issued by United Dominion Industries, Inc. The following is summarized
       condensed consolidating financial information segregating the parent and
       guarantor subsidiaries from nonguarantor subsidiaries. The guarantor
       subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and guarantees
       are full, unconditional and joint and several. Separate financial
       statements and other disclosures of the guarantor subsidiaries are not
       presented because management believes these financial statements would
       not provide relevant material additional information to users.

The Shareholders
United Dominion Industries Limited:


Under date of January 28, 2000, we reported on the consolidated statements of
financial position of United Dominion Industries Limited as at December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
changes in shareholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1999, as contained in the 1999 annual report to shareholders.
These consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated
by reference in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year 1999. In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we have
audited the related financial statement schedule in the accompanying Index to
Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedule as of and for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997. The financial statement schedule is the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
