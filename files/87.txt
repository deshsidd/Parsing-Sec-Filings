ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
       FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Information

The  discussions  under Business, Risk Factors, Properties  and  Legal
Proceedings   and   the  following  discussions   under   Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results   of
Operations  and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about  Market
Risk contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning  of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
of  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which  represent
the  Company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events.  When
used  in  this  document  and  in  documents  incorporated  herein  by
reference,  the words "expects," "plans," "anticipates,"  "indicates,"
"believes,"   "forecast,"   "guidance,"  "outlook,"   "may,"   "will,"
"should,"  and  similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-
looking   statements.  Forward-looking  statements  include,   without
limitation,  the  Company's  expectations  concerning  operations  and
financial  conditions,  including changes in capacity,  revenues,  and
costs,  future financing plans and needs, overall economic conditions,
plans  and  objectives for future operations, and the  impact  on  the
Company  of  its  results  of  operations  in  recent  years  and  the
sufficiency  of its financial resources to absorb that  impact.  Other
forward-looking  statements include statements  which  do  not  relate
solely  to  historical facts, such as, without limitation,  statements
which  discuss the possible future effects of current known trends  or
uncertainties,  or  which indicate that the future  effects  of  known
trends  or  uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or  assured.
All   forward-looking  statements  in  this  report  are  based   upon
information  available to the Company on the date of this report.  The
Company  undertakes  no obligation to publicly update  or  revise  any
forward-looking  statement, whether as a result  of  new  information,
future  events, or otherwise. The Risk Factors listed in Item  1A,  in
addition  to  other  possible  factors not  listed,  could  cause  the
Company's actual results to differ materially from historical  results
and from those expressed in forward-looking statements.

Overview

The  Company  has incurred very large operating and net losses  during
the past five years, as shown in the following table:
                             Year ended December 31,
(in millions)      2005        2004       2003       2002        2001

Operating loss     $ (93)      $(144)     $  (844)   $(3,300)    $(2,470)
Net loss            (861)       (761)      (1,228)    (3,511)     (1,762)


These  losses reflect, among other things, a substantial  decrease  in
the  Company's  revenues in 2001 and 2002. This revenue  decrease  was
primarily driven by (i) a steep fall-off in the demand for air travel,
particularly business travel, primarily caused by weakness in the U.S.
economy,  (ii)  reduced pricing power, resulting mainly  from  greater
cost  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  travelers  (especially  business
travelers),  increasing competition from LCCs,  and  the  use  of  the
Internet  and  (iii)  the  aftermath of the Terrorist  Attacks,  which
accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand and  reduced
industry revenues. Subsequent to 2002, passenger traffic significantly
improved,  reflecting  a  general  economic  improvement.   In   2005,
mainline passenger load factor increased 3.8 points year-over-year  to
78.6  percent.   In addition, mainline passenger revenue  yield  began
rebounding in 2005 and increased 4.0 percent year-over-year.  However,
passenger  revenue  yield remains depressed by  historical  standards.
The  Company believes this depressed passenger yield is the result  of
its  reduced pricing power resulting from the factors listed in clause
(ii) above, and other factors, which the Company believes will persist
indefinitely and possibly permanently.


                                1


The  Company's  2004  and 2005 financial results were  also  adversely
affected  by  significant increases in the price  of  jet  fuel.   The
average  price per gallon of fuel increased 33.9 cents  from  2003  to
2004  and  51.9  cents  from  2004  to  2005.  These  price  increases
negatively  impacted fuel expense by $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion  in
2004  and  2005, respectively. Continuing high fuel prices, additional
increases  in the price of fuel, and/or disruptions in the  supply  of
fuel, would further adversely affect the Company's financial condition
and its results of operations.

In  response to the challenges faced by the Company, during  the  past
five years the Company has implemented several restructuring and other
initiatives:

- - Following  the  Terrorist  Attacks,  the  Company  reduced  its
  operating  schedule  by  approximately 20 percent  and  reduced  its
  workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs.

- - In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce
  its  annual  costs by $2 billion.  These initiatives  involved:  (i)
  scheduling efficiencies, (ii) fleet simplification, (iii) streamlined
  customer interaction, (iv) distribution modifications, (v) in-flight
  product    changes,    (vi)   operational    changes    and    (vii)
  headquarters/administration efficiencies.   As  a  result  of  these
  initiatives,  the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs  by  March
  2003.

- - In February 2003, American asked its employees for approximately
  $1.8  billion in annual savings through a combination of changes  in
  wages,  benefits  and work rules.  In April 2003,  American  reached
  agreements  with  its three unions (the Labor Agreements)  and  also
  implemented various changes in the pay plans and benefits  for  non-
  unionized  personnel, including officers and other  management  (the
  Management Reductions). The Labor Agreements and Management Reductions
  resulted in an estimated $1.8 billion in annual savings and included a
  workforce  reduction of approximately 9,300 jobs. In  addition,  the
  Company  and American reached concessionary agreements with  certain
  vendors,  lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively, the Vendors,
  and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements), resulting in an estimated
  $200 million in annual cost savings.  Generally, under the terms  of
  these Vendor Agreements, the Company or American received the benefit
  of  lower rates and charges for certain goods and services, and more
  favorable  rent and financing terms with respect to certain  of  its
  aircraft.

- - Subsequent  to  the April 2003 Labor Agreements  and  Management
  Reductions, the Company announced the Turnaround Plan.  The Turnaround
  Plan is the Company's strategic framework for returning to sustained
  profitability and emphasizes: (i) lower costs, (ii) an increased focus
  on  what  customers' truly value and are prepared to pay for,  (iii)
  increased  union  and employee involvement in the operation  of  the
  Company and (iv) the need for a more sound balance sheet and financial
  structure.

- - Subsequent  to  the  announcement of the  Turnaround  Plan,  the
  Company  has  worked with its unions and employees to  identify  and
  implement additional initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and
  revenues and reduce costs.  These initiatives included: (i) the return
  of under-used gate space and the consolidation of terminal space, (ii)
  the de-peaking of its hub at Miami, the reduction in the size of its
  St. Louis hub and the simplification of its domestic operations, (iii)
  the  acceleration  of  the retirement of certain  aircraft  and  the
  cancellation or deferral of aircraft deliveries, (iv) the improvement
  of  aircraft utilization across its fleet and an increase in seating
  density  on  certain fleet types, (v) the sale of  certain  non-core
  assets,  (vi) the expansion of its international network, where  the
  Company   believes  that  higher  revenue  generating  opportunities
  currently exist, (vii) the implementation of an on-board food purchase
  program and new fees for ticketing and baggage services, (viii) lower
  distribution  costs,  (ix) the implementation of  fuel  conservation
  initiatives,  (x) the increase in third-party maintenance  contracts
  obtained  by  the Company's Maintenance and Engineering group,  (xi)
  upgrading of flight navigation systems to provide more direct routings
  and (xii) numerous other initiatives.

- - As part of its effort to build greater employee involvement, the
  Company  has  sought to make its labor unions and its employees  its
  business  partners in working for continuous improvement  under  the
  Turnaround  Plan. Among other things, the senior management  of  the
  Company meets regularly with union officials to discuss the Company's
  financial  results  as  well  as the competitive  landscape.   These
  discussions include (i) the Company's own cost reduction and revenue
  enhancement  initiatives, (ii) a review of initiatives, in-place  or
  contemplated, at other airlines and the impact of those initiatives on
  the  Company's  competitive  position, and  (iii)  benchmarking  the
  Company's revenues and costs against what would be considered "best in
  class" (the Company's Performance Leadership Initiative).


                                2



These  initiatives  have  significantly improved  the  Company's  cost
structure  and  resulted  in the Company achieving  what  the  Company
believes  to  be the lowest unit costs of the traditional carriers  in
2004.  However, a significant number of the Company's competitors have
recently   reorganized  or  are  reorganizing,  including  under   the
protection  of  Chapter  11 of the Bankruptcy Code,  including  Delta,
United, US Airways and Northwest.  These competitors are significantly
reducing  their cost structures through bankruptcy, resulting  in  the
Company's cost structure once again becoming less competitive.

The Company's ability to become profitable and its ability to continue
to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of
factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company's control.  Some
of  the  risk factors that affect the Company's business and financial
results  are discussed in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A.  As  the
Company seeks to improve its financial condition, it must continue  to
take  steps  to generate additional revenues and significantly  reduce
its  costs. Although the Company has a number of initiatives  underway
to  address  its cost and revenue challenges, the ultimate success  of
these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot be assured.  It
will  be  very  difficult,  absent  continued  restructuring  of   its
operations, for the Company to continue to fund its obligations on  an
ongoing  basis,  or  to  become profitable, if  the  overall  industry
revenue  environment  does not continue to  improve  and  fuel  prices
remain at historically high levels for an extended period.


                                3




LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Assets

At  December  31,  2005, the Company had $3.8 billion in  unrestricted
cash  and  short-term investments and $510 million in restricted  cash
and short-term investments.

Significant Indebtedness and Future Financing

Substantial  indebtedness is a significant  risk  to  the  Company  as
discussed  in the Risk Factors listed in Item 1A.  During  2003,  2004
and  2005, in addition to refinancing its Credit Facility and  certain
debt  with  an  institutional investor (see Note 6 to the consolidated
financial   statements),   the  Company   raised   an   aggregate   of
approximately  $4.5  billion of financing to fund capital  commitments
(mainly  for aircraft and ground properties) and operating losses  and
to  bolster  its  liquidity. As of the date of  this  Form  10-K,  the
Company believes that it should have sufficient liquidity to fund  its
operations for the foreseeable future, including repayment of debt and
capital   leases,   capital   expenditures   and   other   contractual
obligations.  However, to maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company
continues   to   implement  its  restructuring  and   cost   reduction
initiatives, and because the Company has significant debt,  lease  and
other  obligations in the next several years, as well  as  substantial
pension funding obligations (refer to Contractual Obligations in  this
Item  7),  the  Company  will need access to additional  funding.  The
Company's possible financing sources primarily include: (i) a  limited
amount  of additional secured aircraft debt (a very large majority  of
the Company's owned aircraft, including virtually all of the Company's
Section  1110-eligible  aircraft, are  encumbered)  or  sale-leaseback
transactions  involving  owned aircraft,  (ii)  debt  secured  by  new
aircraft  deliveries,  (iii)  debt  secured  by  other  assets,   (iv)
securitization  of  future  operating  receipts,  (v)  the   sale   or
monetization  of certain assets, (vi) unsecured debt and (vii)  equity
and/or equity-like securities. However, the availability and level  of
these  financing sources cannot be assured, particularly in  light  of
the  Company's  and  American's recent financial results,  substantial
indebtedness,  reduced credit ratings, high fuel prices,  historically
weak revenues and the financial difficulties being experienced in  the
airline  industry.  The inability of the Company to obtain  additional
funding  on acceptable terms would have a material adverse  impact  on
the  ability of the Company to sustain its operations over  the  long-
term.

Credit Ratings

AMR's and American's credit ratings are significantly below investment
grade.  Additional  reductions in AMR's or American's  credit  ratings
could  further  increase  its borrowing or  other  costs  and  further
restrict the availability of future financing.

Credit Facility Covenants

American  has  a  credit facility consisting of  a  fully  drawn  $540
million  senior  secured  revolving  credit  facility,  with  a  final
maturity  on June 17, 2009, and a fully drawn $248 million  term  loan
facility,  with  a final maturity on December 17, 2010 (the  Revolving
Facility  and  the Term Loan Facility, respectively, and collectively,
the Credit Facility). American's obligations under the Credit Facility
are guaranteed by AMR.


                                4



The  Credit  Facility  contains a covenant  (the  Liquidity  Covenant)
requiring  American  to  maintain,  as  defined,  unrestricted   cash,
unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for  drawing
under  committed  revolving credit facilities of not less  than  $1.25
billion  for each quarterly period through the remaining life  of  the
credit  facility.  American  was  in  compliance  with  the  Liquidity
Covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to be able to continue to
comply  with this covenant.  In addition, the Credit Facility contains
a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR to maintain a ratio of
cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense
(less   capitalized   interest),  income   taxes,   depreciation   and
amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain gains or losses and non-
cash  items)  to  fixed  charges (comprising  interest  expense  (less
capitalized  interest) and rentals).  AMR was in compliance  with  the
EBITDAR  covenant as of December 31, 2005 and expects to  be  able  to
continue to comply with this covenant for the period ending March  31,
2006.   However,  given the historically high price of  fuel  and  the
volatility  of  fuel  prices and revenues, it is difficult  to  assess
whether AMR and American will, in fact, be able to continue to  comply
with  the Liquidity Covenant and, in particular, the EBITDAR Covenant,
and  there  are no assurances that AMR and American will  be  able  to
comply  with these covenants.  Failure to comply with these  covenants
would  result in a default under the Credit Facility which - - if  the
Company  did  not  take  steps to obtain a  waiver  of,  or  otherwise
mitigate,  the  default  -  -  could  result  in  a  default  under  a
significant  amount of the Company's other debt and lease  obligations
and  otherwise  adversely  affect the Company.   See  Note  6  to  the
consolidated  financial  statements for the required  ratios  at  each

   (1) The  table does not include a transaction in which American
       purchased certain obligations due October 2006 with a face value of
       $261  million at par value from an institutional investor. In
       conjunction with the purchase, American borrowed an additional $245
       million under an existing mortgage agreement with a final maturity in
       December 2012 from the same investor.
   (2) Amount shown is net of $207 million the Company will receive to
       fund future capital spending at JFK, $77 million held by a trustee for
       future debt service on the bonds and a discount of $25 million.

See  Notes  5  and  6  to  the consolidated financial  statements  for
additional information regarding the debt issuances listed above.

During  the  fourth quarter of 2005, the Company issued  and  sold  13
million shares of its common stock.  The Company realized $223 million
from the equity sale.


                                5



The  Company's cash flow from operating activities improved  in  2005.
Net  cash  provided  by  operating activities during  the  year  ended
December  31, 2005 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $307 million  over
2004, due primarily to an improved revenue environment.

Capital  expenditures  during 2005 were  $681  million  and  primarily
included  the acquisition of 20 Embraer 145 aircraft and the  cost  of
improvements  at  JFK.   A  portion of the improvements  at  JFK  were
reimbursed  to  the Company through a financing transaction  discussed
further above and in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

During  2004,  the  Company  sold its remaining  interest  in  Orbitz,
resulting  in  total  proceeds of $185 million  and  a  gain  of  $146
million.

Working Capital

AMR  (principally  American)  historically  operates  with  a  working
capital deficit, as do most other airline companies.  In addition, the
Company has historically relied heavily on external financing to  fund
capital  expenditures.  More recently, the Company has also relied  on
external financing to fund operating losses.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

American  has determined that it holds a significant variable interest
in, but is not the primary beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the
lessors  under  84  of  its aircraft operating  leases.  These  leases
contain  a  fixed  price  purchase option, which  allows  American  to
purchase  the  aircraft at a predetermined price on a specified  date.
However,  American  does  not guarantee  the  residual  value  of  the
aircraft.   As  of  December 31, 2005, future lease payments  required
under these leases totaled $2.6 billion.

Certain  special  facility revenue bonds have been issued  by  certain
municipalities  primarily to purchase equipment  and  improve  airport
facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as  operating
leases.  Approximately $1.9 billion of these bonds (with total  future
payments  of approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31,  2005)  are
guaranteed  by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $523  million  of
these   special  facility  revenue  bonds  contain  mandatory   tender
provisions  that  require  American to make operating  lease  payments
sufficient  to repurchase the bonds at various times: $28  million  in
2006, $100 million in 2007, $218 million in 2008, $112 million in 2014
and  $65  million in 2015. Although American has the right to remarket
the  bonds,  there  can  be  no assurance that  these  bonds  will  be
successfully  remarketed.  Any payments to redeem  or  purchase  bonds
that  are not remarketed would generally reduce existing rent leveling
accruals  or  be considered prepaid facility rentals and would  reduce
future  operating  lease commitments. Approximately  $198  million  of
special  facility revenue bonds with mandatory tender provisions  were
successfully  remarketed in 2005.  They were acquired by  American  in
2003  under  a  mandatory  tender provision.   Thus,  the  receipt  by
American of the proceeds from the remarketing in July 2005 resulted in
an  increase  to  Other  liabilities and deferred  credits  where  the
tendered bonds had been classified pending their use to offset certain
future operating lease obligations.

In  addition,  the Company has other operating leases,  primarily  for
aircraft  and airport facilities, with total future lease payments  of
$4.8  billion as of December 31, 2005.  Entering into aircraft  leases
allows the Company to obtain aircraft without immediate cash outflows.

        1  Certain  special  facility  revenue  bonds  issued  by
           municipalities  -  which  are supported  by  operating
           leases  executed by American - are guaranteed  by  AMR
           and/or  American. The special facility  revenue  bonds
           with  mandatory tender provisions discussed above  are
           included  in this table under their ultimate  maturity
           date  rather  than  their mandatory  tender  provision
           date.   See  Note  5  to  the  consolidated  financial
           statements for additional information.
        2  As  of  December 31, 2005, the Company had commitments
           to  acquire  two  Boeing 777-200ERs in  2006;  and  an
           aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s and seven Boeing  777-
           200ERs  in  2013  through 2016. The Company  has  pre-
           arranged   backstop   financing  available   for   the
           aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2006.
        3  The  table  reflects minimum required  payments  under
           capacity purchase contracts between American  and  two
           regional    airlines,   Chautauqua   Airlines,    Inc.
           (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines  Inc.   If  the
           Company   terminates  its  contract  with   Chautauqua
           without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its  15
           Embraer  aircraft to the Company.   If  this  were  to
           happen,  the  Company  would take  possession  of  the
           aircraft  and  become  liable  for  lease  obligations
           totaling  approximately  $21  million  per  year  with
           lease  expirations  in  2018 and  2019.   These  lease
           obligations are not included in the table above.   See
           Note  4  to the consolidated financial statements  for
           additional information.
        4  Amounts  represent contractual amounts due,  including
           interest.    Interest  on  variable  rate   debt   was
           estimated  based on the current rate at  December  31,
           2005.


                                7



        5  Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or
           services, primarily construction related costs at  JFK
           and    information    technology   related    support.
           Substantially all of the Company's construction  costs
           at  JFK  will be reimbursed through a fund established
           from  a  previous financing transaction.  The  Company
           has  made  estimates  as  to  the  timing  of  certain
           payments  primarily  for construction  related  costs.
           The  actual  timing of payments may  vary  from  these
           estimates.   Substantially  all   of   the   Company's
           purchase  orders  issued for other  purchases  in  the
           ordinary   course   of  business  contain   a   30-day
           cancellation clause that allows the Company to  cancel
           an order with 30 days notice.

        6  Includes expected other postretirement benefit payments through
           2015.
        7  Excludes a $2.3 billion accident liability, related to the
           Terrorist Attacks and flight 587, recorded in Other liabilities
           and deferred credits, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
           financial statements.  This liability is offset in its entirety
           by a receivable, recorded in Other assets, which the Company
           expects to receive from insurance carriers as claims are resolved.

Pension Obligations  In addition to the commitments summarized  above,
the  Company is required to make contributions to its defined  benefit
pension  plans under the minimum funding requirements of the  Employee
Retirement  Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company's estimated  2006
contributions  to its defined benefit pension plans are  approximately
$250  million.  This estimate reflects the provisions of  the  Pension
Funding Equity Act of 2004. (The effect of the Pension Funding  Equity
Act  was  to  defer  to later years a portion of the minimum  required
contributions that would otherwise have been due for the 2004 and 2005
plan years.)

Under  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Company's defined
benefit  plans are underfunded as of December 31, 2005 by $3.2 billion
based  on  the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) and by $2.3  billion
based on the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) (refer to Note 10 to
the  consolidated financial statements).  The Company's funded  status
at  December  31,  2005 under the relevant ERISA funding  standard  is
similar  to  its  funded status using the ABO  methodology.    Due  to
uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating
future  required contributions to its defined benefit  pension  plans,
such  as interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns,
and,  in  particular,  the  impact of proposed  legislation  currently
pending  the reconciliation process of the U.S. Congress, the  Company
is  not  able to reasonably estimate its future required contributions
beyond  2006.   However,  absent  significant  legislative  relief  or
significant  favorable  changes in market  conditions,  or  both,  the
Company  could  be  required  to  fund  in  2007  a  majority  of  the
underfunded  balance under the relevant ERISA funding standard.   Even
with  significant  legislative  relief  (including  proposed  airline-
specific  relief),  the Company's 2007 required minimum  contributions
are expected to be higher than the Company's 2006 contributions.

Results of Operations

The  Company incurred an $861 million net loss in 2005 compared  to  a
net  loss  of  $761 million in 2004. The Company's 2005  results  were
impacted  by the continuing increase in fuel prices and certain  other
costs,  offset by an improvement in revenues; a $108 million  decrease
in  depreciation expense related to a change in the depreciable  lives
of  certain  aircraft  types described below, in  Critical  Accounting
Policies  in this Item 7, and in Note 1 to the consolidated  financial
statements;  and  productivity improvements and other cost  reductions
resulting from progress under the Turnaround Plan.  The Company's 2005
results  were also impacted by a $155 million aircraft charge,  a  $73
million facility charge, an $80 million charge for the termination  of
a  contract, a $37 million gain related to the resolution  of  a  debt
restructuring  and  a  $22  million credit  for  the  reversal  of  an
insurance  reserve.   All  of  these amounts  are  included  in  Other
operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, except
for  a  portion  of  the facility charge which is  included  in  Other
rentals and landing fees.  Also included in the 2005 results was a $69
million  fuel tax credit.  Of this amount, $55 million is included  in
Aircraft  fuel expense and $14 million is included in Interest  income
in  the  consolidated  statement of operations.   The  Company's  2004
results  include  a  $146 million gain on the sale  of  the  Company's
remaining investment in Orbitz that is included in Miscellaneous,  net
in  the  consolidated  statement of operations and  net  restructuring
charges  of  $11 million included in Other operating expenses  in  the
consolidated  statement of operations.  In addition, the  Company  did
not record a tax benefit associated with its 2005 or 2004 losses.

Although  the  Company  is currently receiving a depreciation  expense
benefit  from  the change in estimate of depreciable  lives  discussed
above,  the  Company's operating expenses excluding depreciation  will
likely be higher than operating new aircraft during the extended  life
of  the MD-80 aircraft.  For example, based on current estimates,  the
Company's   MD-80  aircraft  consume  more  fuel  and   incur   higher
maintenance  expense  than  a  new  aircraft  that  requires   minimal
maintenance during the first several years of operation.

Revenues
2005   Compared   to   2004      The  Company's   revenues   increased
approximately $2.1 billion, or 11.1 percent, to $20.7 billion in  2005
compared  to  2004.  American's passenger revenues increased  by  10.6
percent,  or  $1.6 billion, on a capacity (available seat mile)  (ASM)
increase  of 1.2 percent.  American's passenger load factor  increased
3.8  points to 78.6 percent and passenger revenue yield per  passenger
mile  increased  4.0  percent to 12.01 cents.   This  resulted  in  an
increase  in passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM)  of  9.3
percent  to  9.43  cents. In 2005, American derived  approximately  65
percent  of  its  passenger  revenues  from  domestic  operations  and
approximately 35 percent from international operations.  Following  is
additional information regarding American's domestic and international
RASM and capacity:

The   Company's   Regional  Affiliates  include   two   wholly   owned
subsidiaries,  American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and  Executive  Airlines,
Inc.  (collectively,  AMR  Eagle), and two independent  carriers  with
which   American  has  capacity  purchase  agreements,  Trans   States
Airlines,   Inc.   (Trans  States)  and  Chautauqua   Airlines,   Inc.
(Chautauqua).

Regional  Affiliates' passenger revenues, which are based on  industry
standard  proration  agreements  for flights  connecting  to  American
flights, increased $272 million, or 14.5 percent, to $2.1 billion as a
result  of  increased capacity and load factors.  Regional Affiliates'
traffic increased 22.8 percent to 8.9 billion revenue passenger  miles
(RPMs),  while  capacity increased 17.3 percent to 12.7 billion  ASMs,
resulting  in  a 3.2 point increase in passenger load factor  to  70.4
percent.

Cargo revenues decreased 0.5 percent, or $3 million, primarily due  to
a  0.5 percent decrease in cargo revenue yield per ton mile.  However,
the  cargo division saw a $49 million increase in fuel surcharges  and
other  service  fees.  These amounts are included  in  Other  revenues
which are discussed below.

Other  revenues  increased  18.3 percent, or  $205  million,  to  $1.3
billion  due  in  part  to increased cargo fuel surcharges,  increased
third-party   maintenance   contracts  obtained   by   the   Company's
maintenance  and engineering group and increases in certain  passenger
fees.

compared  to  2003.  American's passenger revenues  increased  by  4.8
percent,  or  $689 million, on a capacity (available seat mile)  (ASM)
increase  of 5.3 percent.  American's passenger load factor  increased
2.0 points to 74.8 percent while passenger revenue yield per passenger
mile  decreased  by 3.1 percent to 11.54 cents.  This  resulted  in  a
decrease  in passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM)  of  0.5
percent  to  8.63  cents. In 2004, American derived  approximately  66
percent  of  its  passenger  revenues  from  domestic  operations  and
approximately 34 percent from international operations.  Following  is

Regional  Affiliates' passenger revenues, which are based on  industry
standard  proration  agreements  for flights  connecting  to  American
flights, increased $357 million, or 23.5 percent, to $1.9 billion as a
result  of  increased capacity and load factors.  Regional Affiliates'
traffic increased 32.0 percent to 7.3 billion revenue passenger  miles
(RPMs),  while  capacity increased 26.0 percent to 10.8 billion  ASMs,
resulting  in  a 3.0 point increase in passenger load factor  to  67.2

2005  increased  7.9  percent compared to 2004 to  10.50  cents.  This
increase  in  operating expenses per ASM is due primarily  to  a  42.1

   Total operating expenses       $20,805        $2,016        10.7 %

(a)  Aircraft fuel expense increased primarily due to a 42.1 percent
     increase in American's price per gallon of fuel (including the benefit
     of a $55 million fuel excise tax refund received in March 2005 and the
     impact of fuel hedging) offset by a 2.2 percent decrease in American's
     fuel consumption.
(b)  Effective January 1, 2005, in order to more accurately reflect
     the expected useful lives of its aircraft, the Company changed its
     estimate of the depreciable lives of its Boeing 737-800, Boeing 757-
     200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft from 25 to 30 years.  As a
     result of this change, Depreciation and amortization expense was
     reduced by approximately $108 million during the year and the per
     share net loss was $0.65 less than it otherwise would have been.
(c)  Other operating expenses increased due to a $155 million charge
     for the retirement of 27 MD-80 aircraft, facilities charges of $56
     million as part of the Company's restructuring initiatives and an $80
     million  charge for the termination of an airport construction
     contract.  These charges were somewhat offset by a $37 million gain
     related to the resolution of a debt restructuring and a $22 million
     credit for the reversal of an insurance reserve.  The account was also
     impacted by an increase in communications charges of $53 million year-
     over-year due to increased international flying and higher rates.

2004  Compared  to  2003    The  Company's  total  operating  expenses
increased  2.8  percent, or $505 million, to  $18.8  billion  in  2004
compared to 2003.  American's mainline operating expenses per  ASM  in
2004  decreased  4.1  percent compared to 2003  to  9.73  cents.  This
decrease  in operating expenses per ASM is due primarily to American's
cost  savings initiatives and occurred despite the benefit in 2003  of
the  receipt  of a grant from the U.S. government and a  38.5  percent
increase in American's price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact  of
fuel hedging) in 2004 relative to 2003.

   Total operating expenses       $18,789       $   505         2.8 %

(a)  Wages, salaries and benefits decreased due to lower wage rates
     and reduced headcount primarily as a result of the Labor Agreements
     and Management Reductions, discussed in the Company's 2003 Form 10-K,
     which became effective in the second quarter of 2003. This decrease
     was offset to some degree by increased headcount related to capacity
     increases.
(b)  Aircraft fuel expense increased due to a 38.7 percent increase in
     the Company's price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel
     hedging) and a 3.3 percent increase in the Company's fuel consumption.
(c)  Maintenance, materials and repairs increased primarily due to
     increased aircraft utilization, the benefit from retiring aircraft
     subsiding and increases in contractual rates in certain flight hour
     agreements for outsourced aircraft engine maintenance.
(d)  Aircraft rentals decreased primarily due to the removal of leased
     aircraft from the fleet in the second half of 2003 as part of the
     Company's restructuring initiatives and concessionary agreements with
     certain lessors, which reduced future lease payment amounts and
     resulted in the conversion of 30 operating leases to capital leases in
     the second quarter of 2003.
(e)  Included in this amount are restructuring charges for 2004 which
     included (i) the reversal of reserves previously established for
     aircraft return costs of $20 million, facility exit costs of $21
     million and employee severance of $11 million, (ii) $21 million in
     aircraft  charges  and (iii) $42 million in employee  charges.
     Restructuring charges for 2003 included approximately (i) $341 million
     in aircraft charges offset by a $20 million credit to adjust prior
     accruals, (ii) $92 million in employee charges, (iii) $62 million in
     facility exit costs and a (iv) $68 million gain resulting from a
     transaction involving 33 of the Company's Fokker 100 aircraft and
     related debt.
(f)  U.S. government grant for 2003 reflects the reimbursement of
     security service fees from the U.S. government under the Emergency
     Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, discussed in Note 2 to the
     consolidated financial statements.

Other Income (Expense)
Other  income  (expense)  consists of  interest  income  and  expense,
interest capitalized and miscellaneous - net.

2005  Compared  to  2004   Increases  in  both  short-term  investment
balances  and interest rates caused an increase in Interest income  of
$83  million,  or  125.8 percent, to $149 million.   Interest  expense
increased $86 million, or 9.9 percent, to $957 million primarily as  a
result  of  increases in interest rates.  Miscellaneous-net  for  2004
includes  a  $146 million gain on the sale of the Company's  remaining
interest in Orbitz.

2004  Compared to 2003  Interest income increased $11 million, or 20.0
percent,  to  $66  million  due primarily to increases  in  short-term
investment  balances and interest rates.  Interest  expense  increased
$168  million,  or  23.9 percent, to $871 million resulting  primarily
from  the  increase  in  the  Company's long-term  debt  coupled  with
increases in interest rates, and an $84 million reduction in  interest
expense  in  2003  related  to  the agreement  reached  with  the  IRS
discussed below.

Income Tax Benefit

2005  and 2004 The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated
with its 2005 and 2004 losses due to the Company providing a valuation
allowance,  as  discussed  in  Note 8 to  the  consolidated  financial
statements.

2003 The  Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with  its
2003  losses  due  to  the  Company providing a  valuation  allowance.
Additionally, in 2003, the Company reached an agreement with  the  IRS
covering  tax years 1990 through 1995. As a result of this  agreement,
the  Company recorded an $80 million tax benefit to reduce  previously
accrued  income  tax  liabilities and  an  $84  million  reduction  in
interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to  the
accrued income tax liabilities.

Outlook

The Company currently expects first quarter mainline unit costs to  be
approximately  10.7  cents.   Capacity  for  American's  mainline  jet
operations is expected to be essentially flat in the first quarter  of
2006  compared  to  the  first quarter of 2005.   American's  mainline
capacity  for  the  full  year 2006 is expected  to  decrease  by  1.3
percent,  with a decrease in domestic capacity of 4.1 percent  and  an
increase in international capacity of 4.0 percent.

Other Information

Environmental  Matters    Subsidiaries of AMR have  been  notified  of
potential liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites
and certain airport locations.  At sites where remedial litigation has
commenced,  potential liability is joint and several.   AMR's  alleged
volumetric  contributions  at  these sites  are  minimal  compared  to
others.    AMR   does  not  expect  these  matters,  individually   or
collectively, to have a material impact on its results of  operations,
financial  position or liquidity.  Additional information is  included
in Item 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Critical  Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation  of  the
Company's  financial statements in conformity with generally  accepted
accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the amounts reported  in  the  consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes.  The Company believes its
estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results  and
the  timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those
estimates.    The  Company  has  identified  the  following   critical
accounting   policies  and  estimates  used  by  management   in   the
preparation of the Company's financial statements: accounting for long-
lived assets, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program, pensions  and
other postretirement benefits, income taxes and tax contingencies.

   Long-lived  assets - The Company has approximately $19  billion  of
   long-lived  assets as of December 31, 2005, including approximately
   $18  billion  related to flight equipment and other  fixed  assets.
   In  addition  to the original cost of these assets, their  recorded
   value  is  impacted  by a number of policy elections  made  by  the
   Company,  including estimated useful lives and salvage values.   In
   accordance  with  Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards  No.
   144,  "Accounting  for  the Impairment or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived
   Assets" (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-
   lived  assets  used  in  operations when events  and  circumstances
   indicate  that  the  assets may be impaired, the undiscounted  cash
   flows  estimated to be generated by those assets are less than  the
   carrying  amount  of those assets and the net  book  value  of  the
   assets  exceeds  their  estimated  fair  value.  In  making   these
   determinations,  the  Company uses certain assumptions,  including,
   but  not  limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the  assets;  and
   (ii)  estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these
   assets,  which  are based on additional assumptions such  as  asset
   utilization,  length  of service and estimated  salvage  values.  A
   change  in  the Company's fleet plan has been the primary indicator
   that  has  resulted in an impairment charge in the  past.   In  the
   fourth  quarter  of  2005,  the Company  permanently  grounded  and
   retired  27  McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airframes,  24  of  which  had
   previously  been in temporary storage.  See further  discussion  of
   the  charge related to the retirement in Note 2 to the consolidated
   financial statements.

   On November 17, 2004, American deferred the delivery date of 54
   Boeing  aircraft by approximately seven years which, in combination
   with  numerous  other  factors, led  American  to  re-evaluate  the
   expected  useful  lives  of its aircraft.   As  a  result  of  this
   evaluation, American changed its estimate of the depreciable  lives
   of  its Boeing 737-800, Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas  MD-80
   aircraft  from  25  to  30 years effective January  1,  2005.   The
   primary  factors that supported changing the estimated useful  life
   of  these  aircraft were (i) the absence of scheduled  narrow  body
   deliveries until  2013 (even these 47 narrow body deliveries  would
   only  replace  less  than  ten percent of  the  Company's  existing
   narrow  body fleet of 547 aircraft assuming the deliveries are  not
   used  to  grow  the  Company's capacity at  that  time),  (ii)  the
   financial condition of the Company, which significantly limits  its
   flexibility  to  purchase new aircraft and  (iii)  the  absence  of
   technology   step  change  for  narrow  body  aircraft,   such   as
   technology  that  would  allow  the Company  to  fly  its  aircraft
   substantially  more efficiently (as was the case with  replacements
   for  previous generation aircraft such as the B-727 which had three
   engines  versus two on the replacement aircraft) that would clearly
   economically  compel  the  Company  to  replace  the   fleet.    In
   addition,  there are currently no government regulations,  such  as
   noise   reduction   requirements,  that  would   require   aircraft
   replacement.

   Subsequent to the change in depreciable lives on January 1, 2005,
   all  of American's fleet types are depreciated over 30 years except
   for  the  Airbus A300 and the Boeing 767, which did  not  generally
   meet the above conditions to support extending their lives.

   It  is  possible that the ultimate lives of the Company's  aircraft
   will  be significantly different than the current estimate  due  to
   unforeseen  events  in the future that impact the  Company's  fleet
   plan,  including  positive or negative developments  in  the  areas
   described above.  For example, operating the aircraft for a  longer
   period  will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating
   costs than if the Company replaced the aircraft.  At some point  in
   the  future,  higher  operating costs could  change  the  Company's
   analysis  of  the  economic  impact of  retaining  aircraft  versus
   replacing them with new aircraft.

   Passenger  revenue - Passenger ticket sales are initially  recorded
   as  a  component  of Air traffic liability.  Revenue  derived  from
   ticket  sales  is  recognized  at the  time  service  is  provided.
   However,  due to various factors, including the industry's  pricing
   structure   and  interline  agreements  throughout  the   industry,
   certain   amounts   are  recognized  in  revenue  using   estimates
   regarding  both  the  timing  of the revenue  recognition  and  the
   amount  of  revenue  to  be recognized, including  breakage.  These
   estimates  are  generally based upon the evaluation  of  historical
   trends,  including the use of regression analysis and other methods
   to  model  the  outcome  of future events based  on  the  Company's
   historical   experience,  and  are  recognized  at  the   time   of
   departure.  The Company's estimation techniques have  been  applied
   consistently  from year to year.  However, due to  changes  in  the
   Company's  ticket refund policy and changes in the  travel  profile
   of  customers,  historical  trends may  not  be  representative  of
   future results.


                                15



   Frequent  flyer  program  -   American uses  the  incremental  cost
   method  to  account for the portion of its frequent flyer liability
   incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying  on
   American  or  American Eagle.  American's frequent flyer  liability
   is  accrued  each time a member accumulates sufficient  mileage  in
   his  or her account to claim the lowest level of free travel  award
   (25,000  miles)  and  the award is expected to  be  used  for  free
   travel.   American  includes fuel, food, and reservations/ticketing
   costs in the calculation of incremental cost.  These estimates  are
   generally  updated  based  upon the Company's  12-month  historical
   average  of  such  costs.  American also accrues a  frequent  flyer
   liability for the mileage credits that are expected to be used  for
   travel   on  participating  airlines  based  on  historical   usage
   patterns and contractual rates.

   At  both  December  31,  2005  and 2004,  American  estimated  that
   approximately  ten million free travel awards were expected  to  be
   redeemed  for  free  travel on American  and  American  Eagle.   In
   making  the  estimate of free travel awards, American has  excluded
   mileage  in  inactive accounts, mileage related  to  accounts  that
   have  not  yet reached the lowest level of free travel  award,  and
   mileage  in active accounts that have reached the lowest  level  of
   free  travel  award but which are not expected to ever be  redeemed
   for   free  travel  on  American  or  participating  airlines.  The
   Company's  total liability for future AAdvantage award  redemptions
   for  free,  discounted  or upgraded travel  on  American,  American
   Eagle  or  participating airlines as well as  unrecognized  revenue
   from  selling AAdvantage miles to other companies was approximately
   $1.5  billion  and $1.4 billion (and is recorded as a component  of
   Air   traffic  liability  in  the  consolidated  balance   sheets),
   representing  17.7 percent and 19.6 percent of AMR's total  current
   liabilities, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

   Revenue earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies  is
   recognized  in two components.  The first component represents  the
   revenue  for  air transportation sold and is valued at fair  value.
   This  revenue  is  deferred  and recognized  over  the  period  the
   mileage is expected to be used, which is currently estimated to  be
   28   months.   The  second  revenue  component,  representing   the
   marketing  products sold and administrative costs  associated  with
   operating  the AAdvantage program, is recognized in  the  month  of
   sale.

   The  number  of free travel awards used for travel on American  and
   American  Eagle  was  2.6  million in 2005 and  2004,  representing
   approximately  7.2  percent and 7.5 percent of passengers  boarded,
   respectively.   The  Company  believes  displacement   of   revenue
   passengers  is  minimal  given  the  Company's  load  factors,  its
   ability   to  manage  frequent  flyer  seat  inventory,   and   the
   relatively  low  ratio  of  free award usage  to  total  passengers
   boarded.

   Changes  to  the  percentage  of the amount  of  revenue  deferred,
   deferred  recognition period, percentage of awards expected  to  be
   redeemed  for  travel  on  participating airlines,  cost  per  mile
   estimates  or  the  minimum  award  level  accrued  could  have   a
   significant  impact on the Company's revenues or  incremental  cost
   accrual in the year of the change as well as in future years.

   Pensions and other postretirement benefits - The Company's  pension
   and   other  postretirement  benefit  costs  and  liabilities   are
   calculated  using various actuarial assumptions and  methodologies.
   The  Company  uses certain assumptions including, but  not  limited
   to,  the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected  return
   on plan assets; and (iii) expected health care cost trend rate.

   These assumptions as of December 31 were:
                                                   2005      2004

        Expected return on plan assets             8.75%     9.00%
        Expected health care cost trend rate:

   The Company's discount rate is determined based upon the review  of
   year-end  high quality corporate bond rates. Lowering the  discount
   rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2005 would increase  the
   Company's  pension  and  postretirement  benefits  obligations   by
   approximately  $662  million  and $170 million,  respectively,  and
   increase   estimated  2006  pension  and  postretirement   benefits
   expense by $75 million and $9 million, respectively.

   The  expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation  of
   the  Company's historical trends and experience taking into account
   current  and  expected market conditions and the  Company's  target
   asset allocation of 40 percent longer duration corporate bonds,  25
   percent  U.S.  value  stocks,  20 percent  developed  international
   stocks,  five  percent emerging markets stocks and  bonds  and  ten
   percent  alternative (private) investments. The expected return  on
   plan  assets  component of the Company's net periodic benefit  cost
   is  calculated  based  on the fair value of  plan  assets  and  the
   Company's  target  asset  allocation.   The  Company  monitors  its
   actual  asset  allocation  and believes that  its  long-term  asset
   allocation  will  continue to approximate  its  target  allocation.
   The  Company's  historical annualized ten-year rate  of  return  on
   plan  assets, calculated using a geometric compounding  of  monthly
   returns,  is  approximately 10.6 percent as of December  31,  2005.
   Lowering  the expected long-term rate of return on plan  assets  by
   50  basis  points as of December 31, 2005 would increase  estimated
   2006 pension expense by approximately $38 million.

   The  health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of the
   Company's  historical  trends and experience  taking  into  account
   current  and  expected market conditions.  Increasing  the  assumed
   health  care  cost  trend rate by 100 basis points  would  increase
   estimated 2006 postretirement benefits expense by $40 million.

   The  Company  has  pension and postretirement benefit  unrecognized
   net  actuarial  losses  as of December 31, 2005,  of  approximately
   $2.2 billion and $300 million, respectively.  The unrecognized  net
   actuarial  losses represent changes in the amount of the  projected
   benefit   obligation,   the  postretirement   accumulated   benefit
   obligation   and  plan  assets  resulting  from  (i)   changes   in
   assumptions  and (ii) actual experience differing from assumptions.
   The  amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss  component  of
   the  Company's 2006 pension and postretirement benefit net periodic
   benefit costs are expected to be approximately $81 million  and  $1
   million,  respectively. The Company's total  2006  pension  expense
   and   postretirement   expense  is  currently   estimated   to   be
   approximately $467 million and $248 million, respectively.

   The  Company  records an additional minimum pension liability  when
   its  accumulated  benefit  obligation exceeds  the  pension  plans'
   assets  in excess of amounts previously accrued for pension  costs.
   As  of  December 31, 2005, the Company's additional minimum pension
   liability  was  $1.4 billion, up from $1.0 billion as  of  December
   31,  2004,  primarily  as a result of a decrease  in  the  discount
   rate.   The  increase  in the Company's minimum  pension  liability
   resulted  in a 2005 debit to equity of approximately $379  million.
   An  additional minimum pension liability is recorded as an increase
   to  the  pension  liability, an increase to other  assets  (to  the
   extent  that  a plan has unrecognized prior service  costs)  and  a
   charge  to  stockholders'  equity  (deficit)  as  a  component   of
   Accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss.   See  Note  10   to   the
   consolidated   financial  statements  for  additional   information
   regarding the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits.

   Income  taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
   with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  109,  "Accounting  for
   Income  Taxes".   Accordingly, the Company records a  deferred  tax
   asset  valuation  allowance when it is more likely  than  not  that
   some  portion  or  all  of  its deferred tax  assets  will  not  be
   realized.   The Company considers its historical earnings,  trends,
   and  outlook  for  future years in making this  determination.  The
   Company had a deferred tax valuation allowance of $1.3 billion  and
   $833  million  as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  See
   Note  8  to  the  consolidated financial statements for  additional
   information.


                                17



   Tax  contingencies  -  The  Company  has  reserves  for  taxes  and
   associated  interest that may become payable in future years  as  a
   result   of  audits  by  tax  authorities.   Although  the  Company
   believes  that the positions taken on previously filed tax  returns
   are  reasonable, it nevertheless has established tax  and  interest
   reserves  in  recognition  that  various  taxing  authorities   may
   challenge   the  positions  taken  by  the  Company  resulting   in
   additional  liabilities for taxes and interest.  The  tax  reserves
   are  reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur
   that  affect  the  Company's  potential  liability  for  additional
   taxes,  such  as  lapsing  of applicable statutes  of  limitations,
   conclusion  of  tax audits, additional exposure  based  on  current
   calculations,   identification   of   new   issues,   release    of
   administrative   guidance,  or  rendering  of  a   court   decision
   affecting a particular tax issue.  In 2003, the Company reached  an
   agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995 and  as
   a  result, recorded an $80 million tax benefit to reduce previously
   accrued  income  tax  liabilities and an $84 million  reduction  in
   interest  expense to reduce previously accrued interest related  to
   accrued tax liabilities.

New   Accounting  Pronouncement    In  December  2004,  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board issued Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS 123(R)).
SFAS  123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants  of  employee stock options, to be recognized in the  financial
statements  based  on  their  fair  values.   Prior  to  SFAS  123(R),
companies could elect to account for share-based payments under APB 25
and  provide the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123 (described
in  Note  1 to the consolidated financial statements). SFAS 123(R)  is
effective  January  1, 2006 for AMR.  Under SFAS 123(R),  compensation
expense  will be recognized for the portion of outstanding  awards  as
service  is  provided, based on the grant-date  fair  value  of  those
awards  calculated  under  SFAS 123 for  pro  forma  disclosures.  The
Company expects that the impact of adoption on its first quarter  2006
results  will  be similar to the amounts disclosed in  each  quarterly
period during 2005.  However, subsequent to the first quarter of 2006,
the  impact  of  SFAS 123(R) will decrease significantly  due  to  the
vesting period ending for stock options issued under the 2003 Employee
Stock Incentive Plan.
