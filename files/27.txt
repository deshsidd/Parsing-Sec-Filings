1997, 1998 and 1999 refer to the ADC's fiscal years ended October&nbsp;31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively; and 2000 refers to ADC's fiscal year ending October&nbsp;31, 2000.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Industry Background</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the global deregulation of communications markets, thousands of new competitive service providers have entered the market to compete with the
incumbent service providers of Internet/data, video and voice communications. These new service providers are rapidly changing the marketplace by offering new choices and bundles of communications
services never before offered to consumers and businesses. The dynamics of the deregulated communications market has resulted in the recent high growth rate of sales for suppliers of communications
equipment, software and services. The factors driving this growth consist primarily of the following: increased demand from consumers and businesses for high-speed, integrated services
such as Internet access, digital video and broadband wireless access; rapid growth of Internet services; continuous technological development of fiber-optics, integrated circuits and software to
increase broadband capacities and applications; and the convergence of Internet/data, video, and voice network traffic onto broadband, multiservice networks. ADC believes that these trends will
continue to drive changes in the global communications industry for the foreseeable future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased
demand for higher-speed, higher-capacity services such as Internet access, digital video and broadband wireless access has in turn resulted in substantial demands to build
and upgrade the communications network infrastructure. Communications networks are increasingly required to transmit large volumes of data and video for the purpose of communicating information,
conducting business and delivering entertainment. In addition, both consumers and businesses are requesting high-speed connections from a single broadband, multiservice provider offering a
range of prices for various bundles of integrated Internet/data, video and voice services. Specifically, the industry term "broadband" refers to all transmission speeds of T1 (1.544&nbsp;million
bits per second) and higher. Growth in broadband applications has resulted in increased infrastructure investment by communications service providers in order to expand network capacity and provide
new applications and services to meet users' needs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
important technological developments have spurred growth in the communications equipment industry. One important technological change has been the deployment of fiber-optic
transmission systems. In a fiber-optic system, lasers transmit Internet/data, video and voice traffic in the form of analog or digital coded light pulses through glass fibers. The increasing shift to
fiber-optic transmission systems has been principally due to the ability of fiber optics to carry large volumes of information at high speeds, its insensitivity to electromagnetic interference and the
high transmission quality made possible by the physical properties of light. As technologies such as Synchronous Optical NETwork
(SONET), Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and 1550 nanometer laser transmission technologies have evolved over the last several years, the capacity of fiber-optic systems to transport
information has increased significantly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
development of cost-effective digital technology has also allowed greater capacity (or speed) in network transmission and has resulted in an increasing trend over the
past decade to replace analog technology in copper, fiber and wireless transmission networks. In analog technology, information is converted to a voltage or current wave form for processing or
transmission. In digital technology, information is converted to digital bits and then processed or transmitted using computer-based

components. High-speed digital technology developments such as SONET, cell-based Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
modulation technologies have enabled network providers to transmit increasing amounts of data and video communications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless
technology developments have also had an impact on the communications equipment industry. There has been substantial growth in wireless communications such as cellular
telephone services and satellite-based services, as well as Personal Communications Services (PCS) communications, Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services (MMDS) and Local Multipoint
Distribution Services (LMDS) for wireless cable services and wireless data and paging services. This growth has been driven by the convenience of mobility and the limits of wireline infrastructure. In
particular, in countries without reliable or extensive wireline systems, wireless service could ultimately provide the primary service platform for both mobile and fixed communications applications
due to the potential savings in installation time and cost. ADC believes that in future years the continuing development of wireless communications technology could substantially extend the reach of
current communications networks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
believes that broadband, multiservice networks represent a key enabling capability for meeting the information needs of consumers and businesses around the world. The rapid growth
of Internet/ data and digital video traffic has driven the need for broadband infrastructure. Additional bandwidth is required as the result of a wide range of new applications, including video and
audio programs on the Internet, wireless Internet access, personal video conferencing from a personal computer, video e-mail, video on demand, electronic commerce, distance learning,
telecommuting, telemedicine and high-speed imaging such as remote medical imaging. ADC believes that the global deregulation of communications markets is transforming traditional
communications service providers into integrated communications providers. Traditional communications service providers offer only a limited selection of Internet/data, video or voice
services&#151;each on a separate network connection and a separate customer bill. Integrated communications providers operate broadband, multiservice networks that offer faster,
cost-effective and integrated Internet/data, video and voice services over a single high-speed network connection and send one bill for all the services the customer uses. As a
result of deregulation, each service provider now competes for customers by offering the best-value bundle of communications services over the most cost-effective network. As a
result of competition among communications service providers to win and retain customers with bundled services, there is a large and growing global market for network equipment, software and
integration services to build and upgrade broadband, multiservice networks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Strategy</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's strategy is to capitalize on opportunities in the global communications market by providing the network equipment, software and integration services to
enable communications service providers to service their residential and business customers with broadband, multiservice networks offering faster, cost-effective and integrated
Internet/data, video and voice services. ADC's broad range of products and services address key areas of the communications network infrastructure, and are used to design, build
and upgrade networks, provide equipment to connect and access networks and transport communications services, and provide software to generate, deliver and manage communications services. ADC's many
product and service offerings address the diverse needs of its customers, including local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television operators, wireless service providers, new
competitive service providers, broadcasters, enterprises, governments, system integrators and communications equipment manufacturers and distributors.

Internet, and increasing consumer and business demands for broadband communications has created significant global opportunities to build and upgrade broadband, multiservice networks. Telephone
companies, cable television operators, Internet/data service providers, wireless service providers and other communications service providers are building the broadband infrastructure required to
offer high-speed Internet access, data, video, telephony and other interactive multimedia services to residential and business customers. As broader network bandwidths are continually
required for these services, ADC believes that building and upgrading of broadband, multiservice networks presents one of the greatest market growth opportunities in the communications industry today.
ADC is focusing its development and marketing resources on network equipment, software and integration services that will enable communications service providers worldwide to serve their residential
and businesses customers with broadband, multiservice networks offering faster, cost effective and integrated Internet/data, video and voice services.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
recent years, increasingly significant portions of new communications equipment purchased by public network providers and private network customers have employed fiber-optic
transmission, digital, integrated circuit, wireless and broadband copper-based technologies for residential, business and wireless broadband local loop applications. In the future, these
communications network equipment purchasing trends will include increasingly sophisticated, software-intensive, OSS and network management systems. As a result, ADC's internal and external product
development activities are primarily directed at the following areas: (i)&nbsp;the integration of fiber optic technology into additional products; (ii)&nbsp;the continuing development of its
Homeworx system for telephony, data and integrated video, telephony and Internet/data applications; (iii)&nbsp;the development of network systems (including billing and customer care) software;

predict at this time. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and the loss of market share by ADC. ADC believes that industry regulatory change may create new
opportunities for suppliers of communications equipment. ADC expects, however, that such opportunities may attract increased competition from others as well. In addition, ADC expects that Lucent
Technologies will continue to be a major supplier to the RBOCs and will compete more extensively outside the RBOC market. ADC also believes that the rapid technological changes which characterize the
communications industry will continue to make the markets in which ADC competes attractive to new entrants. There can be no assurance that ADC will be able to compete successfully with its existing or
new competitors or that competitive pressures faced by ADC will not materially and adversely affect its business, operating results or financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Manufacturing and Supplies</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC manufactures a wide variety of products which are fabricated, assembled and tested in its own facilities or in subcontracted facilities. In an effort to
reduce costs, ADC also utilizes off-shore assembly and sourcing. The manufacturing process for ADC's electronic products consists primarily of assembly and testing of electronic systems
built from fabricated parts, printed circuit boards and electronic components. The manufacturing process for ADC's electromechanical products consists primarily of fabrication of jacks, plugs, and
other basic components from raw materials, assembly of components and testing. ADC's sheet metal, plastic molding, stamping and machining capabilities permit ADC to configure components to customer
specifications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
purchases raw materials and component parts, consisting primarily of copper wire, optical fiber, steel, brass, nickel-steel alloys, gold, plastics, printed circuit boards, solid
state components, discrete electronic components and similar items, from several suppliers. Although a few of the components used by ADC are single-sourced, ADC has experienced no significant
difficulties to date in obtaining adequate quantities of these raw materials and component parts. This circumstance could change in the future, however, and ADC cannot be sure that the quantity or
quality of raw materials and component parts will be as readily available in the future.

is expected to be approximately $100&nbsp;million. Construction of the facilities began late in fiscal 1999 and is expected to be completed in
2001. The new corporate headquarters facility is expected to comprise approximately 1.2&nbsp;million square feet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
owns a manufacturing facility and an adjacent distribution facility in Shakopee, Minnesota that comprises approximately 372,000 square feet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC

Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.</FONT></P>

believes that the facilities used in its operations and currently under development are suitable for their respective uses and adequate to meet ADC's current needs.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
herewith, Tenant is entering into that certain Lease dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree to enter into this Ground Lease, as follows:</FONT></P>

exceptions set forth in the Owner's Policy.</FONT></P>

(40)&nbsp;years, commencing on the date hereof and expiring on the fortieth anniversary of the date hereof, both days inclusive. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Transition Date (as defined in</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;Section&nbsp;15(f)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), this Ground Lease may be terminated by Tenant at any time, without penalty, upon
not less than ten (10)&nbsp;days notice to Landlord.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground Lease Rent.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The total rent for the term of this Ground Lease ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Ground
Lease Rent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") is $100.00. Landlord acknowledges receipt of the sum of $100.00, which represents a prepayment of the Ground Lease Rent due hereunder during the term hereof. Such
Ground Lease Rent shall be absolutely net to Landlord.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, from and after the Transition Date, the annual Ground Lease Rent shall be based on the Fair Market Rent (defined below), as prorated for any partial
year or month, in monthly installments payable in advance beginning on the Transition Date and thereafter on the first day of each calendar month. As used herein, the term
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Fair Market Rent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall mean, as of and
following the Transition Date, the prevailing market rate per rentable square foot per annum (on a triple net basis) for a comparable ground lease (assuming the Land is unimproved) in the county in
which the Land is located where (i)&nbsp;the tenant is a fully creditworthy tenant, (ii)&nbsp;the lessor and the lessee each are acting prudently and knowledgeably, (iii)&nbsp;the lessor and the
lessee are well informed or advised and acting in their respective best interests, (iv)&nbsp;the lessor and the lessee have each considered the location and other aspects of the Land, and
(v)&nbsp;the rent is not affected by undue stimulus.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair
Market Rent shall be determined as of the Transition Date and each third (3rd) anniversary date thereof (each, a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Determination
Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), such determination to be made pursuant to the terms, conditions and time periods set forth below with each such determination becoming effective only for the periods
following the applicable Determination Date. Landlord and Tenant shall use their best efforts to agree as to the Fair Market Rent within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after each Determination Date. If the
parties are unable to agree upon the Fair Market Rent within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after a Determination Date, the Fair Market Rent shall be determined in the same manner as "Appraised Value" is
determined under the second and third paragraphs of</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;Section&nbsp;23(b)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, except that the term "Appraised Value" wherever it appears in
such section shall be replaced with the term "Fair Market Rent," and the term "value" wherever it appears in such section shall be replaced with the term "rent amount." Until such Fair Market Rent is
determined as provided above, Tenant shall pay (i)&nbsp;with respect to the period commencing immediately after the Transition Date, $100.00 per month or such other amount as it believes represents
the Fair Market Rent, and (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any other period following the third (3rd) anniversary date of the Transition Date, the Fair Market Rent as in effect immediately prior to the
most recent Determination Date. If Fair Market Rent is ultimately established at a higher amount than the amount then being paid by Tenant, then within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the determination of
such Fair Market Rent as provided above, Tenant shall pay the Fair Market Rent accrued from the Determination Date to the date of such payment less any amounts already paid, plus interest on the
unpaid amount at an interest rate equal to the "Prime Rate" as published from time to time in the Eastern edition of</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;The Wall Street
Journal</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Each change in such interest rate due to a change in such Prime Rate shall take effect simultaneously with such change in such Prime Rate without notice. If the Prime
Rate shall be in violation of any usury or similar law, then the Prime Rate shall be reduced to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable usury or similar law.</FONT></P>

thereof, now existing or hereafter erected, constructed or installed on the Land and remove the Personalty installed or placed in, on, or about the Improvements and the Land. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, so long as the Lease is in effect, Tenant's rights hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions of the Lease.</FONT></P>

Landlord all right, title and interest of Tenant in and to the Improvements and Personalty remaining on the Land.</FONT></P>

the event Landlord shall fail or refuse to sign and deliver any application for building and other permits required, if any, for the erection, construction and installation of
Improvements (if same is required to be signed by Landlord) within ten (10)&nbsp;days after Tenant submits same to Landlord for execution, for all building and other permits and licenses necessary
for the erection, construction and installation of the Improvements, or for the use and operation of the Land and for certificates of occupancy, then Tenant shall have the right and authority to sign
any such application in the name of

substantially no more favorable to the offeror within three (3)&nbsp;months from the date it notified Tenant of such offer. If Tenant fails to do so, the right granted to Tenant hereby shall
continue and be reinstated. If Tenant desires to purchase the Land, it shall accompany its notice of intent to purchase with (i)&nbsp;an earnest money deposit payable to Landlord equal to the sum
(if any) offered as an earnest money deposit by the offeror, and (ii)&nbsp;a contract executed by Tenant including the same material terms as the offer, which shall require a closing on the later of

(i)&nbsp;purchaser and seller are typically motivated, (ii)&nbsp;purchaser and seller are well informed or advised and acting in their respective best interests, the parties having each considered
the location and other aspects of the Land, (iii)&nbsp;a reasonable time is allowed for exposure of the property in the open market, (iv)&nbsp;payment is made in cash or its equivalent,
(v)&nbsp;financing, if any, is on terms generally available in the community at the specified date and typical for the Land in its locale, (vi)&nbsp;the price represents a normal consideration for
the assets unaffected by special financing and (vii)&nbsp;the Land is being sold without any Improvements thereon, subject to the Ground Lease at the rental rate provided for herein (as such rate
may be adjusted pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) and subject to Tenant's leasehold estate to a person unaffiliated with Tenant. This option shall terminate

5&nbsp;years experience in the appraisal of similar property in the area in which the Land is located. Within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after such retention, each appraiser shall submit to the parties
and to each other a written determination of the Appraised Value based on the criteria set forth above. Such Appraised Value shall be the mean average of the values determined by the two
appraisers,</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the lesser of such values so determined does not vary by more than five percent (5%) from the greater of such
values. If there shall be such variance, then the two appraisers shall, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after notice of such variance, select a third appraiser with like experience (and if the two
appraisers are unwilling or unable to do so, such appraiser shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association) who shall submit a written

the mean average of the values determined by the three appraisers, but any value that is more than ten percent (10%) different from the mean average shall be disregarded, and the Appraised Value shall
be the mean average of the remaining values. If all three values determined by the three appraisers are more than ten percent (10%) different from the mean average, the Appraised Value shall mean the
mean average of the two values which are closest to one another.</FONT></P>

the determination of such Appraised Value, and subject to disapproval as hereinafter provided, Landlord and Tenant shall within ten (10)&nbsp;days thereafter (or sooner if

executed, and for any commitments made or sustained upon any work performed, whether on or off the site, and upon any materials, equipment, tools, construction equipment and machinery which represent
costs to be reimbursed under Article&nbsp;7 of the Agreement and the Contractor's Fee as specified in Section&nbsp;5.1 of this Agreement, but not anticipated profit. This will include the actual
costs incurred by the Contractor in terminating subcontracts and purchase orders as well as costs associated with the return or reshelving of material, supplies and inventory. The Contractor shall
also be paid its reasonable labor and equipment costs incurred in demobilizing off the site. The Contractor shall have no obligation to secure the site until the Owner provides the Contractor with
reasonable assurance of payment therefor." In addition, the Contractor and its subcontractors shall be paid a reasonable amount for general administrative costs and profit for all work performed to

the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall correct
it promptly after receipt of written notice from the Owner to do so unless the Owner has previously given the Contractor a written acceptance of such condition. This period of time between Substantial

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Each
Participant irrevocably appoints and authorizes Lease Plan North America,&nbsp;Inc., to act as its Agent Lessor hereunder and under the other Operative
Documents, and the Bank to act as its Administrative Agent hereunder and under such Operative Documents, with such powers as are specifically delegated to Agent Lessor or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Participant authorizes and directs Agent Lessor to, and Agent Lessor agrees
for the benefit of the Participants that it will, on the initial Advance Date and each other Advance Date, accept the documents described in</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;Article&nbsp;III
&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>of this Participation Agreement. Each of the Agents accepts the agency hereby created applicable to it and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, agrees to
receive all payments and proceeds pursuant to the Operative Documents and disburse such payments or proceeds in accordance with the Operative Documents. Neither Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Lease and this Participation Agreement. Neither Agent shall be responsible to any Participant (or to any other Person) (i)&nbsp;for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties of any party contained in the Lease, this Participation Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or
received by any of them under, the Operative Documents, other than in the case of Agent Lessor the representations and warranties made by Agent Lessor in</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7.4</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or (ii)&nbsp;for the value,

therein or (iii)&nbsp;for any failure by Lessee, any Participant or any other third party (other than such Agent) to perform any of its obligations under any Operative Agreement. Each Agent may
employ agents, trustees or attorneys-in-fact, may vest any of them with any property, title, right or power deemed necessary for the purposes of such appointment and shall not
be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any of them selected by it. Neither Agent nor any of its respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, or in connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Neither
Agent shall have any duty or obligation to manage, control, use, operate, store, lease, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Premises, any other
Collateral or the Lease, or to otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Lease or any related document to which such Agent is a party, except
as expressly provided by the terms hereof or
by law, and no implied duties of any kind shall be read into any Operative Agreement against either Agent. The permissive right of either Agent to take actions enumerated in any Operative Document
shall never be construed as a duty, unless such Agent is instructed or directed to exercise, perform or enforce one or more rights by the Required Participants (provided that such Agent has received
indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it). No provision of the Operative Documents shall require either Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its obligations under the Operative Documents, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers thereunder. It is understood and agreed that the duties of each Agent are
ministerial in nature.</FONT></P>

Neither Agent shall be deemed to have notice or knowledge of an Event of Default or Default unless a Responsible Officer of such Agent is notified in writing of such Event of Default or Default. If

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of ADC Telecommunications, Inc. is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of all financial statements and other information
contained in this Annual Report. To ensure reliability of financial data, ADC has established and maintains an internal control system, which provides reasonable assurance that financial reports do
not contain any material misstatement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit Committee of the board of directors is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the overall performance of the ADC's financial reporting and accounting practices. The
Committee meets periodically and independently with management, internal auditors and the independent public accountants to discuss ADC's internal accounting controls, auditing and financial matters.
The internal auditors and independent public accountants have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the financial statements and related notes in this report are presented fairly in all material respects, and that they were prepared according to generally accepted
accounting principles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>To ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc.:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. and Subsidiaries as of October&nbsp;31, 1999 and 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareowners' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October&nbsp;31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of
ADC's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Saville Systems PLC, a company acquired
during 1999 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests, as of October&nbsp;31, 1998, or for each of the two years in the period ended October&nbsp;31, 1998 (see Note&nbsp;5). Such
statements are included in the consolidated financial statements of ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. and Subsidiaries and reflect total assets and total revenues of 9.6&nbsp;percent and
10.8&nbsp;percent in 1998, and 7.2&nbsp;percent and 8.4&nbsp;percent in 1997, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. These statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have
been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to amounts included for Saville Systems PLC, is based solely upon the reports of the other auditors.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and
the reports of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ADC Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. and Subsidiaries as of October&nbsp;31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the three years then ended October&nbsp;31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principles of Consolidation:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADC
Telecommunications,&nbsp;Inc. (a Minnesota corporation) and all significant subsidiaries in which ADC has more than a 50% equity ownership (collectively, "ADC"). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash Equivalents:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents represent short-term investments in commercial paper with original
maturities of three months or less. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term Investments:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term investments held by ADC and its subsidiaries are classified
as available-for-sale securities under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.&nbsp;115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at market value with any unrealized holding gains and losses presented as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income within shareowners' investment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories include material, labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of first-in,
first-out cost or market.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and Equipment:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
method over estimated useful lives of three to thirty years or, in the case of leasehold improvements, over the term of the lease, if shorter. Both straight-line and accelerated methods of
depreciation are used for income tax purposes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired is amortized on
a straight-line basis ranging from five to twenty-five years. Management periodically assesses the amortization period and recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill
based upon an estimate of future cash flows from related operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and Development Costs:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's policy is to expense all research and development costs in the period incurred.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Taxes:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue Recognition:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized at time of delivery and acceptance, and after consideration of all the terms and conditions of
the customer contract.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue
from services consists of fees for systems requirements definition, system design and analysis, customization and installation services, ongoing system management, system
enhancements, service bureau processing, facilities management and maintenance fees. Services revenue is recognized as the services are performed, primarily on a time and materials basis and to a
lesser extent on a fixed fee basis over the term of the services provided. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, generally one year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue
from the licensing of software rights is recognized at the time of delivery of the product to the customer, provided that ADC has no remaining service obligations,
collectibility is considered
<!-- ZEQ.=1,SEQ=7,EFW="9930982",CP="ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.",DN="10",FOLIO=7,FILE='DISK039:[99STP0.99STP3280]KJ3280A.;16',USER='DMATHES',CD='30-DEC-1999;15:45' -->
probable and the fees are fixed and determinable. Where there are service obligations that are essential to the functionality of the software installed, license fees are recorded over the term of the
initial customization period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Currency Translation:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC converts assets and liabilities of foreign operations to their U.S. dollar
equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet date and records translation adjustments in shareowners' investment in the balance sheet. Income statements of foreign operations are translated
from the operations' functional currency to U.S. dollar equivalents at the exchange rate on the transaction dates. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are reported in other income (expense),
net.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Estimates:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge
of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.</FONT></P>

identifies projects that do not have technological feasibility or other uses at the time of acquisition and records expense at the time of acquisition for these
in-process research and development projects. Acquired in-process research and development expenses aggregating $88.6&nbsp;million in 1999 were associated with the purchase
acquisitions. Appraisals for each acquired in-process technology were determined using the income approach, discounted based on the estimated likelihood that the project will ultimately
succeed. The most significant components of acquired in-process research and development were $47.5&nbsp;million associated with optical components, which are used in fiber amplifiers,
under development at Spectracom, and $23.6&nbsp;million associated with products which enhance speed and capacity of digital loop networks, under development at Teledata. Upon acquisition, the
acquired Spectracom optical components were estimated to be 69% complete, and the acquired Teledata products under development were estimated to be 65% complete.

1999. ADC also maintains a Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan in order to enhance the ability to attract and retain the services of experienced and knowledgeable outside directors.
This plan provides for granting of a maximum of 840,000 non-qualified stock options at fair market value. As of October&nbsp;31, 1999, 240,500 shares were available for option grants

15% or more of ADC's common stock, each right (a "Right") not owned by such person or group will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's then current purchase price ($62.50 for each
one-half share of ADC's common stock at October&nbsp;31, 1999), common stock of ADC having a value of twice the Right's purchase price. The Rights would not be triggered, however, if the
acquisition of 15% or more of ADC's common stock is pursuant to a tender offer or exchange for all outstanding shares of ADC's common stock which is determined by the board of directors to be fair and
in the best interests of ADC and its shareowners. The Rights are redeemable at $0.01 per share any time prior to the time they become exercisable. The Rights will expire on November&nbsp;28, 2005,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the first quarter of 1999, ADC's management approved a restructuring plan, which included initiatives to integrate the software operations of the former Wireless Systems Group
with the newly formed Integrated Solutions Group, consolidate unproductive and duplicative facilities and dispose of product lines that no longer fit ADC's current focus and growth strategy. This
business restructuring plan was completed during the fourth quarter of 1999. Actual costs incurred were $30&nbsp;million, an amount equal to the initial estimate recorded during the first quarter of
1999. The charges included $4.4&nbsp;million for employee termination costs, $8.8&nbsp;million on the sale of a subsidiary, $11.1&nbsp;million associated with the write-off of
goodwill and discontinuance of the City RFX product line, as well as $5.7&nbsp;million in facilities closing and other costs that were directly related to ADC's exit plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the fourth quarter of 1999, ADC's management approved a restructuring plan to consolidate the Portland, Oregon manufacturing operations of the Broadband Access and Transport
Group into Minneapolis, Minnesota. The estimated restructuring charges were $9&nbsp;million. The estimate was composed of $4.8&nbsp;million for employee termination costs, $1.5&nbsp;million for
facilities closing costs, and $2.7&nbsp;million for asset disposals and other directly associated costs. As of October&nbsp;31, 1999, there have been no costs incurred as part of this
restructuring because the plan was still in its initial stages. Completion of the consolidation is expected by the end of the third quarter of 2000.</FONT></P>

(3)&nbsp;a foreign-currency hedge, (4)&nbsp;a net investment in a foreign operation or (5)&nbsp;a trading instrument. ADC engages primarily in derivatives classified as trading instruments, and
changes in the fair value of
the derivatives are reported in current-period earnings. ADC also hedges some selected foreign-currency denominated forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), in which changes in the fair value of
highly effective derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
formally documents all relations between hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. ADC formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in
cash flows of the hedged items.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash Flow Hedges:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC uses foreign-currency forward-exchange contracts with durations of less than twelve months to
hedge against the effect of exchange-rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany transactions. Such contracts had a total notional amount of $8.5&nbsp;million at October&nbsp;31,
1999. For the year ended October&nbsp;31,1999, ADC recognized a gain of $352,415 reported in other income (expense) in the statements of income for the hedges that have settled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of October&nbsp;31,1999, $580,997 of deferred net gains on derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to earnings
during the next twelve months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading Derivatives:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC purchases foreign-currency forward exchange contracts with contract terms normally lasting
less than six months to protect against the adverse effect that exchange-rate fluctuations may have on foreign-currency-denominated assets, principally Canadian Dollars, Mexican Pesos and
the Euro. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, in accordance with SFAS&nbsp;No.133, because they relate to existing assets denominated in a foreign currency. The gains and losses
on both the derivatives and the foreign-currency-denominated assets are recorded as transaction adjustments in current earnings. At October&nbsp;31, 1999, there were no open trading derivatives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating Leases:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of ADC's operations are conducted using leased equipment and facilities. These leases are
non-cancelable and renewable, with expiration dates ranging through the year 2014. The rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income was
$24.2&nbsp;million, $24.9&nbsp;million and $17.7&nbsp;million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
has entered into a five-year operating lease agreement for new domestic administrative facilities. The total cost of the facilities covered by the agreement is
expected to be approximately $100&nbsp;million. Construction of the facilities began late in fiscal 1999 and is expected to be completed in 2001. The lease provides for a substantial residual value
guarantee (less than 90% of the total cost), which is due upon termination of the lease and includes purchase and renewal options. ADC may exercise its purchase option or the facilities may be sold to
a third party. Upon termination of the lease, ADC expects the fair market value of the leased facilities to substantially reduce or eliminate the payment under the residual value guarantees. The table
of future minimum operating lease payments below excludes any payments related to these guarantees.

telephone companies, cable television operators, wireless service providers, new competitive service providers, broadcasters, enterprises, governments, system integrators and communications equipment
manufacturers and distributors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BROADBAND ACCESS AND TRANSPORT</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;products include access and transport systems that deliver broadband, multiservice
communications to residences and businesses over copper, coaxial, fiber-optic and wireless networks. These products are used globally to deliver Internet/data, video and voice services to residential
and business customers</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Generally, these products are aimed at upgrading service providers' networks to broadband capabilities, while also introducing
new service delivery functionality and cost effectiveness into the networks. Broadband Access and Transport products are sold to local
and long-distance telephone companies, cable television operators, wireless service providers, new competitive service providers, broadcasters, enterprises, governments and communications
equipment distributors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
group's transport systems operate between central offices and in the "last mile/kilometer" portion of communications networks and include Soneplex&reg;,
Cellworx&reg;, CellSpan&#153;, Homeworx&#153;, Optiworx&#153;, DV6000&#153; and BroadAccess&#153; systems. The Soneplex system delivers T1-based

copper or fiber facilities. As the industry's first global ATM Virtual Path transport element, the Cellworx system offers bandwidth-efficient, multiservice delivery of Internet/data, video and voice
services, allocates only the bandwidth needed per service type and extends communications services over fiber-optic and copper (using xDSL technologies) facilities to businesses and residences. The
CellSpan broadband wireless system delivers high-speed Internet/data, video and voice services. The Homeworx system enables cable television operators to transport high-speed
digital signals for two-way Internet/data, video and voice services. ADC also provides the Optiworx family of fiber-optic transmitter and node products, along with coaxial amplifiers that
cable television operators use to upgrade their networks to broader bandwidths for digital Internet/data, video, and voice services. The DV6000 system transmits a variety of signal types using a
high-speed, uncompressed digital format over fiber facilities, and is used in the long haul portions of cable television, broadcast and interactive video networks, including distance
learning, government and campus networks. The BroadAccess digital loop carrier system is used to deliver Internet/data and voice services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
group's access systems include both customer located devices (which are part of the service provider's network) and customer premise devices (which are owned by the service
provider's business customer) that can work alone or in conjunction with one of ADC's transport systems or with other vendors' transport systems. These devices include data service units (DSUs),
channel service units (CSUs), T1/E1 multiplexers, T3/E3 multiplexers, integrated access devices (offering a wide variety of Internet/data, video and voice interfaces), MPEG video products and ATM
access concentrators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;products and services consist of systems integration services, operations support systems (OSS)
software and enhanced services/intelligent network software that positions service providers to deliver broadband, multiservice communications over wireline and wireless networks. Systems integration
services are used to design, equip and build communications networks and OSS applications that deliver Internet/data, video and voice services to residences and businesses. OSS software includes the
Saville Systems&reg; line of communications billing and customer care software and the Metrica&reg; line of network performance and service level assurance software. Enhanced services/
intelligent network software includes the NewNet&reg; line of Signaling System 7 (SS7), intelligent network, wireless messaging and provisioning, Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement
Act (CALEA) and Internet applications software. Integrated Solutions products and services are sold to local and long-distance telephone companies, cable television operators, wireless
service providers, new competitive service providers and communications equipment manufacturers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically,
ADC's principal product offerings generally consisted of copper-based and fiber-optic-based products designed to address the needs of its customers for transmission and
connectivity on traditional communications networks. With the growth of multimedia applications and the related development of enhanced Internet/data, video and voice services, ADC's more recent
product offerings and research and development efforts have increasingly focused on emerging technologies and network equipment, software and integration service offerings for broadband communications
applications. The market for broadband communications network equipment, software and integration services is evolving and rapidly changing. ADC's growth is dependent in part on its ability to
successfully develop and commercially introduce new products in each of its product groups and is also dependent on the
growth of the market. The growth in the market for such broadband communications products and services is dependent on a number of factors, including the amount of capital expenditures by
communications service providers, regulatory and legal developments, changes to capital expenditure rates by communications service providers (which could result from the ongoing consolidation of
customers in the market as well as the addition of new customer entrants to the market) and end-user demands for integrated Internet/data, video, voice and other communications services.
There can be no assurance that ADC's new or enhanced products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's
operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to several factors. ADC is growing through acquisition and expansion, and results of operations
described in this report may not be indicative of results to be achieved in future periods. ADC's expense levels are based in part on management's expectations of future revenues. Although management
has and will continue to take measures to adjust expense levels, if revenue levels in a particular period fluctuate, operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, ADC's results of
operations are subject to seasonal factors. ADC historically has experienced a stronger demand for its products in the fourth fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of customer budget cycles and ADC's
fiscal year-end incentives, and has experienced a weaker demand for its products in the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of the number of holidays in late November, December and
early January and a general industry slowdown during that period. There can be no assurance that these historical seasonal trends will continue in the future.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used in this report, the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 refer to ADC's fiscal years ended October&nbsp;31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, and 2000 refers to ADC's fiscal year
ending October&nbsp;31, 2000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;8, 1999, ADC completed the acquisition of Saville Systems PLC. The acquisition was accounted for using the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting. Accordingly, all years have been restated to include the operations and balances of Saville Systems as part of ADC and the Integrated
Solutions Group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
1999, 1998 and 1997, net sales of Broadband Connectivity products increased by 40.4%, 19.8% and 36.8%, respectively. This growth reflects continued strong global demand for
ADC's copper- and fiber-connectivity systems. In addition, sales of fiber-optic components more than doubled in 1999 compared to 1998. Broadband Connectivity's sales have grown in recent years and now
represent approximately half of ADC's net sales. ADC expects that future sales of Broadband Connectivity products will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net sales, although these
products may decline as a percentage of total revenues due to the ongoing evolution of technologies in the marketplace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
1999, 1998 and 1997, net sales of Broadband Access and Transport products increased by 16.0%, 8.1% and 30.2%, respectively. This growth is primarily the result of business
acquisitions, higher
sales of telephone transport systems and ATM access products, and the emerging sales of Homeworx cable telephony systems, but is partially offset by lower sales of other access products.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
1999, 1998 and 1997, net sales of Integrated Solutions products increased 8.4%, 56.6% and 127.9%, respectively. The increase was generated primarily by growth in systems
integration services and software sales, but was partially offset in 1999 by lower sales of Saville Systems software products and the discontinuance of low-margin consulting services.
Sales of systems integration services in 1998 were also favorable as a result of a business acquisition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross Profit:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1999, 1998 and 1997, gross profit percentages were 47.6%, 48.3% and 47.9%, respectively. The
decrease in 1999 was primarily the result of a lower gross profit percentage at Saville Systems due to lower sales of older generation software products during the introduction of
next-generation software products. ADC anticipates that its future gross profit percentage will continue to be affected by many factors, including product mix, the timing of new product
introductions and manufacturing volume.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating Expenses:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Total operating expenses for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $754.3&nbsp;million, $489.0&nbsp;million
and $413.8&nbsp;million, respectively, representing 39.2%, 31.6% and 32.5% of net sales, respectively. Non-recurring charges of $149.0&nbsp;million, $9.2&nbsp;million and
$22.7&nbsp;million are included in the results for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Excluding non-recurring charges, operating expenses would have represented 31.4%, 31.0% and 30.8% of
net sales, respectively. The non-recurring charge in 1999 related to the write-off of purchased in-process research and development costs resulting from the
acquisitions of Teledata Communications, Hadax Electronics, Phasor Electronics, Spectracom and Pathway, together with costs for the strategic restructuring of the former Wireless Systems Group,
consolidation of Broadband Access and Transport manufacturing, and costs directly related to the acquisition of Saville Systems. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by costs
associated with acquired companies, as well as expanded operations necessary to support higher business volumes.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research
and development expenses were $192.9&nbsp;million, $159.3&nbsp;million and $132.8&nbsp;million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, representing 10.0%, 10.3% and
10.4% of net sales, respectively. The dollar increases are primarily due to new product initiatives and business acquisitions. ADC believes that, given the competitive environment and rapidly changing
technology in the communications equipment industry, continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for ADC to remain competitive. Accordingly, ADC intends to continue to
allocate substantial resources to product development for each of its product groups. However, ADC recognizes the need to balance the cost of product development with expense controls, and remains
committed to carefully managing the rate of increase of such expenses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling
and administration expenses were $390.2&nbsp;million, $308.0&nbsp;million and $248.3&nbsp;million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, representing 20.3%, 19.9% and
19.5% of net sales, respectively. These increases primarily reflect the activities of acquired companies, incentives associated with selling activities and additional personnel related to expanded
operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
of ADC's acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase transactions in which the initial purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired assets. As a result of ADC's
acquisition activity, goodwill amortization increased to $22.2&nbsp;million in 1999, compared to $12.5&nbsp;million and $10.0&nbsp;million for 1998 and 1997, respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
identifies projects that do not have technological feasibility or other uses at the time of acquisition and records expense at the time of acquisition for these
in-process research and development projects. Acquired in-process research and development expenses aggregating $88.6&nbsp;million in 1999 were associated with the purchase
acquisitions described in Note&nbsp;5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Appraisals for each acquired in-process technology were determined using the income approach, discounted
based on the estimated likelihood that the project will ultimately succeed. The most significant components of acquired in-process research and development were $47.5&nbsp;million
associated with optical components, which are used in fiber amplifiers, under development at Spectracom, and $23.6&nbsp;million associated with products which enhance speed and capacity of digital
loop networks, under development at Teledata Communications. Upon acquisition, the acquired Spectracom optical components were estimated to be 69% complete, and the acquired Teledata Communications
products under development were estimated to be 65% complete. ADC estimates that the Spectracom and Teledata Communications projects will require an additional $40&nbsp;million and
$15&nbsp;million, respectively, of research and development expenses to complete these technologies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Income (Expense), Net:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1999, 1998 and 1997, interest income was $12.4&nbsp;million, $9.3&nbsp;million and
$9.9&nbsp;million, respectively. For 1999, 1998 and 1997, interest expense was $7.6&nbsp;million, $0.8&nbsp;million and $0.5&nbsp;million, respectively. The
year-over-year changes reflect the use of debt to finance acquisitions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
remaining other income (expense) represents the gain or loss on foreign exchange transactions, the sale of fixed assets and activity associated with investments.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Taxes:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The effective income tax rate for 1999, 1998 and 1997 was significantly affected by non-tax
deductible acquisition costs and purchased in-process research and development charges. These expenses are associated with the acquisitions made during the current year. In addition, the
marginal tax rate of 37% was applied to restructuring expenses. Excluding the impact of the benefits associated with non-recurring charges, the effective income tax rate was 34%, 33% and
34% for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.</FONT></P>

Connectivity sales increased $262.7&nbsp;million, or 40.4%, in 1999 compared to 1998 due primarily to increased demand for copper- and fiber-connectivity systems. In
addition, sales of fiber-optic components more than doubled in 1999 compared to 1998. In 1998, sales increased $107.4&nbsp;million, or 19.8%. Strong worldwide growth in Broadband Connectivity
systems continues as a result of growth in Internet/data traffic and digital services, which are creating demand for broader bandwidth connections, and the growth of new service providers, which are
creating demand for connectivity to new and existing communications networks.</FONT></P>

due to the expansion of manufacturing facilities as a result of increases in product demand. The decrease in capital spending activity in 1998
was caused primarily by the completion of the Shakopee, Minnesota and Juarez, Mexico manufacturing facilities in 1998. The majority of the spending for these facilities occurred in 1997. Subsequent

Access and Transport sales increased $87.3&nbsp;million, or 16.0%, in 1999 compared to 1998 due primarily to business acquisitions (mainly Teledata Communications) and
higher sales of telephone transport systems and ATM access products. This growth was partially offset by lower demand for other access products. In 1998, sales increased $40.9&nbsp;million, or 8.1%.
For 1998, sales growth was due to higher sales of telephone transport systems and the rollout of Homeworx cable telephony systems in the United States, but was partially offset by lower sales of
access products. Broadband Access and
Transport products are aimed at upgrading service providers' networks to broadband capabilities, while also introducing new service delivery functionality and cost effectiveness into these networks.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
1999, the Broadband Access and Transport segment reported an operating loss of $20.9&nbsp;million, after reporting operating income of $13.1&nbsp;million in 1998. The segment
experienced declining profitability due to increased research and development and selling/marketing expenses for the development and marketing of new products, combined with slower than expected
shipments of new products during 1999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation
and amortization increased $6.4&nbsp;million, or 31.3%, compared to 1998, due primarily to the acquisition of Teledata Communications. For 1998, depreciation and
amortization increased $2.5&nbsp;million, or 14.2%.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
segment's capital additions for 1999 were $18.5&nbsp;million, a decrease of $12.0&nbsp;million, or 39.4%, compared to 1998. Expenditures for software upgrades decreased in
1999 because the majority of software upgrades occurred in 1998 and 1997. Attention was focused on streamlining the cost of operations in 1999 and, as a result, less capital was spent on expansions.
During the fourth quarter of 1999, ADC announced a consolidation of the segment's manufacturing operations to improve cost efficiency. Asset increases during 1999 are mainly attributable to the
acquisition of Teledata Communications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated
Solutions sales increased $29.6&nbsp;million, or 8.4%, in 1999 compared to 1998 due primarily to increases in sales generated by systems integration services, but this
increase was partially offset by lower sales of Saville Systems software products and the discontinuance of low-margin consulting services. The 56.6% increase in 1998 sales was
attributable to an approximately 56% increase in sales for both systems integration services and software products. Sales of systems integration services in 1998 were also favorable as a result of the
acquisition of W.E. Tech,&nbsp;Inc. The growth in systems integration services is a result of a broad range of service providers building and upgrading networks that offer integrated Internet/data,
video and voice services. Service providers select ADC's systems integration services for consulting, engineering, installation, software and system support, and activation of broadband, multiservice
communications networks for growth, flexibility and rapid deployment. Service providers also are purchasing OSS software and enhanced services/intelligent network software to generate, deliver and
manage multiple communications services delivered to residential and business customers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
1999, operating income for the Integrated Solutions segment decreased $26.7&nbsp;million, or 51.9%. The decrease was primarily due to Saville Systems generating lower sales
of older generation software products during the introduction of next-generation software products.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation
and amortization increased $5.7&nbsp;million from 1998 to $10.4&nbsp;million in 1999. Implementation of new software systems in 1998 and 1999 contributed to this
overall increase.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
1999, capital expenditures increased by $9.1&nbsp;million, or 90.8%. The increase is due to expansion of operations and implementation of software systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents, primarily short-term investments in commercial paper with maturities of less than 90&nbsp;days, decreased
$184.5&nbsp;million, increased $162.5&nbsp;million and decreased $52.0&nbsp;million during 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The major cause of the 1999 decrease was related to acquisitions. To
prepare for the acquisition of Teledata Communications, ADC borrowed $200.0&nbsp;million late in 1998, resulting in a $328.0&nbsp;million temporary cash balance at year-end. During
1999, $343.3&nbsp;million of cash generated from operations allowed ADC to reduce its note payable from $200.0&nbsp;million to $3.9&nbsp;million. Compared to 1998, ADC generated substantially
greater cash from operations in 1999 as a result of improved sales, as discussed in "Results of Operations" above, and improved management of working capital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
1998, ADC purchased an investment in Efficient Networks,&nbsp;Inc. The initial investment was $5.0&nbsp;million, representing a 5.3% ownership position. During the third
quarter of fiscal 1999, Efficient Networks completed an initial public offering of its common stock, which caused a valuation adjustment in ADC's investment. At October&nbsp;31, 1999, ADC carried
the investment at a market value of $93.1&nbsp;million.

</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent
to year end, Siara Systems, in which ADC has a 7.75% ownership interest, agreed to be acquired by Redback Networks,&nbsp;Inc. in a stock for stock transaction valued at
approximately $4.3&nbsp;billion. ADC's initial investment in Siara Systems was $3.5&nbsp;million. Upon consummation of the acquisition of Siara Systems by Redback Networks, ADC's investment will
be reflected on the balance sheet at the market value of its shares.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
October&nbsp;31, 1999, ADC had a $340&nbsp;million five-year revolving credit facility, which is available for general corporate purposes. Under this
five-year revolving credit facility, borrowings carry an initial interest rate equal to the commercial paper rate plus 25 basis points.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
believes that its current cash and investments, cash generated from operating activities, and available credit facilities will be adequate to fund its working capital requirements
and planned capital expenditures for 2000. However, ADC may find it necessary to seek additional sources of financing to support its capital needs, for additional working capital, potential
investments or acquisitions or otherwise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>YEAR 2000 MATTERS</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many currently installed computer systems and software are coded to accept only two-digit entries in the date code fields. These date code fields
will need to accept four-digit entries to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. This problem could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of
business operations (including, among other things, a temporary inability to process transactions, send invoices or engage in other similar business activities). As a result, many companies' computer
systems and software will need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with Year 2000 requirements. The potential global impact of the Year 2000 problem is not known, and, if not corrected in a
timely manner, could affect ADC and the United States and world economy generally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's
project team (consisting of representatives from its information technology, finance, business development, manufacturing, product development, sales, marketing and legal
departments) has addressed both internal and external Year 2000 issues. ADC's internal financial, manufacturing and other computer systems have been reviewed to assess and minimize Year 2000 issues.
ADC's assessment of internal systems included its information technology ("IT") as well as non-IT systems (systems which may contain embedded technology in manufacturing or process control
equipment containing microprocessors or other similar circuitry). ADC's Year 2000 readiness program included the following three phases: identifying systems that needed to be modified or replaced,
carrying out the modifications to existing systems or conversion to new systems, and conducting validation testing of various systems and applications to determine their readiness. ADC has completed
all three phases of this program for both corporate-level IT and non-IT systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC's
product development processes contain steps to include Year 2000 readiness verification for all current and future products. Most of ADC's existing products are currently Year
2000 ready, and all of its active products are either Year 2000 ready or have an upgrade path identified on the ADC Year 2000 Internet web page. Several obsolete or ADC discontinued products will not
be upgraded and are so listed on ADC's web page.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amount of work required to address Year 2000 issues was not extensive. ADC has replaced certain of its financial and operational systems in the last several years, and the new
equipment and software has substantially addressed Year 2000 issues. Existing hardware and software was assessed, and any required modifications have been made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
retained a consulting firm to assess ADC's corporate-level IT system readiness for Year 2000. The firm concluded that more than 75% of these hardware and software systems were
Year 2000 ready. ADC has addressed the remaining 25% and the other hardware and software used by ADC and
<!-- ZEQ.=9,SEQ=31,EFW="9930982",CP="ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.",DN="10",FOLIO=9,FILE='DISK039:[99STP0.99STP3280]KC3280B.;7',USER='CTAFT',CD='30-DEC-1999;08:07' -->
its business units for Year 2000 readiness. ADC completed its Year 2000 readiness program for all of its significant internal systems by October&nbsp;31, 1999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, ADC has requested assurances from its major suppliers that they are addressing Year 2000 issues and that products and services purchased by ADC from such suppliers will
function properly in the Year 2000. Also, ADC has requested similar assurances from its major customers that they have adequately addressed Year 2000 issues. These actions have been completed and are
intended to help mitigate the possible external impact of Year 2000 issues. However, it is impossible to fully assess the potential consequences in the event that service interruptions from suppliers
occur or in the event that there are disruptions in such infrastructure areas as utilities, communications, transportation, banking and government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
total estimated cost for resolving ADC's Year 2000 issues was approximately $4.6&nbsp;million, of which approximately $4.1&nbsp;million has been spent through
October&nbsp;31, 1999. The total cost estimate includes the cost of replacing systems in cases where ADC had accelerated plans to replace such systems that were not Year 2000 ready.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
upon assessments to date, ADC completed all major activities for Year 2000 readiness by October&nbsp;31, 1999 and believes it will not experience any material disruption as a
result of Year 2000 issues in internal manufacturing processes, information processing, interfacing with major customers, or with processing orders and billing. However, if certain critical
third-party providers, such as those providers supplying electricity, water, or telephone service, experience difficulties resulting in disruption of service to ADC, a shutdown of certain of ADC's
operations at individual facilities could occur for the duration of the disruption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
most reasonably likely worst-case scenario of failure by ADC or its suppliers or customers to resolve Year 2000 issues could potentially be a temporary slowdown or
cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of ADC's facilities, and/or a temporary inability on the part of ADC to timely process orders and to deliver finished products to customers. Delays
in meeting customers' orders could potentially affect the timing of billings to and payments received from customers and could result in complaints, charges or claims. Customers' Year 2000 issues
could delay the timing of customers' payments to ADC, or result in a change in spending patterns by customers which could affect orders and shipments of ADC's products.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
has a number of contingency plans (in the event of a Year 2000 disruption) for its headquarters and major business unit sites, ranging from primary business systems, to
manufacturing processes and facilities, to customer support procedures. Areas addressed in the plans include: establishing an early warning system to gather information from ADC sites around the
world, arranging additional customer and technical support staff to maintain customer service levels with 24&nbsp;hour&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;day a week coverage during the Year 2000
transition period, and developing contingency planning coordination with key suppliers and customers. Year 2000 readiness and business continuity plans will continue to be reviewed by ADC's Year 2000
program team. Assuming no major disruption in service from utility companies or other critical third-party providers, ADC believes that it will be able to manage its Year 2000 transition without any
material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>EURO CONVERSION</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 1999, several member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates and adopted the Euro as their new common legal
currency. Beginning on such date, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges while the legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between
January&nbsp;1, 1999 and January&nbsp;1, 2002. During the transition period, parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the
<!-- ZEQ.=10,SEQ=32,EFW="9930982",CP="ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.",DN="10",FOLIO=10,FILE='DISK039:[99STP0.99STP3280]KC3280B.;7',USER='CTAFT',CD='30-DEC-1999;08:07' -->
Euro or a legacy currency. Between January&nbsp;1, 2002 and July&nbsp;1, 2002, the participating countries will introduce Euro hard currency and withdraw all legacy currencies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Euro conversion may affect cross-border competition by creating cross-border price transparency. ADC is assessing its pricing and marketing strategy in order to ensure that ADC
remains competitive in a broader European market. ADC is also modifying its information technology systems to permit transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the Euro and provide
for the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies. In addition, ADC is reviewing whether certain existing contracts will need to be modified. ADC's currency risk and risk management for operations
in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the Euro. ADC will continue to evaluate issues involving introduction of the Euro. Based on current information and
assessments, ADC does not expect that the Euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>RISK MANAGEMENT</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact ADC's results of operations and financial condition. To a
limited extent, ADC manages its exposure to these market risks through the use of short-term foreign currency forward contracts. ADC has historically hedged accounts receivable in foreign
currencies, but in 1999 entered into a limited number of contracts to hedge anticipated transactions. See Note&nbsp;10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. ADC uses
forward contracts as risk management tools and not for speculative
purposes. While ADC manages exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relating to customer transactions, the decline in the value of currencies may adversely affect future product sales because ADC's
products may become more expensive for customers to purchase in their local currency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC
owns approximately 2&nbsp;million shares of Efficient Networks,&nbsp;Inc. (EFNT) common stock. With EFNT's recent public offering in July&nbsp;1999 and subsequent changes to

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
our opinion, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1998 and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows (not presented separately
herein) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Saville Systems PLC and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the
United States which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. The financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 1997 and for
the year then ended were audited by other independent accountants, whose report dated January 22, 1998 (except for Comprehensive Income and Note 15 as to which date is March 12, 1999), expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADC Telecommunications, Inc. desires to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is filing
this cautionary statement in connection with the Reform Act. This Form 10-K and our Annual Report to Shareholders, any Form 10-Q or Form 8-K, or any other written or oral statements made by or on our
behalf may include forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. The words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends,"
"estimates," "forecasts," "projects," "could," "may" and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
wish to caution you that any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause such statements to be wrong. Some
of these uncertainties and other factors are listed under the caption "Risk Factors" below (many of which we have discussed in prior SEC filings). Though we have attempted to list comprehensively

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Demand for our products may decrease if we are unable to anticipate and adapt to rapidly changing technology.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communications equipment industry is characterized by rapid technological change. In our industry, we also face evolving industry standards, changing
market conditions and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products using new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards can make existing
products or products under development obsolete or unmarketable. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to these rapidly changing technologies, to enhance our existing
solutions, and to introduce new solutions to address our customers' changing demands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, new product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, development and implementation of new technologies and processes, and a substantial capital
commitment. We have invested, and we will continue to invest, substantial resources for the development of new products. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful
design, development, introduction or marketing of new solutions. In addition, these new solutions and enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve
significant market acceptance. If we fail to anticipate or respond on a cost-effective and timely basis to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we
have any significant delays in product development or introduction, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected in a material adverse way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
future will also depend on the growth of the communications equipment market. The growth in the market for communications equipment products and services is dependent on a number
of factors. These factors include:</FONT></P>

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
cannot predict whether the market for communications equipment products and services will develop rapidly. Also, we cannot predict technological trends or new products in this
market. In addition, we cannot predict whether our products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable. We may not be able to compete successfully, and competitive pressures may
materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our industry is highly competitive.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the communications equipment industry is intense. We believe that competition may increase substantially with the increased use of broadband
networks and recent regulatory changes. We believe our success in competing with other manufacturers of communications equipment products and services will depend primarily on our engineering,
manufacturing and marketing skills, the price, quality and reliability of our products, and our delivery and service capabilities. We anticipate increasing pricing pressures from current and future
competitors. Many of our foreign and domestic competitors have more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, financial and personnel resources than we have. As a result, they may be able to
respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. We cannot predict whether we will be able to compete successfully with our existing and new products and
services or with current and future competitors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we believe that technological change, the increasing addition of Internet/data, video, voice, and other services to networks, continuing regulatory changes and industry
consolidation or new entrants will continue to cause rapid evolution in the competitive environment. The full scope and nature of these changes is difficult to predict at this time. Increased
competition could lead to price cuts, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, which may seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our operating results fluctuate significantly.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter. These fluctuations are the result of a number of factors, including:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition
may also be affected by consolidation among communications equipment providers. We are growing through acquisition and expansion, and our recent results of operations may
not be a good predictor of our results in future periods. Our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular period are lower than expected, our
operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, our results of operations are also subject to seasonal factors. We historically have had stronger demand for our products and services in the
fourth fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of our year-end incentives and customer budget cycles. We have experienced weaker demand for our products and services in the first fiscal quarter,
primarily as a result of the number of holidays in late November, December and early January and a general industry slowdown during that period. We cannot predict if historical seasonal trends will
continue in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>The regulatory environment in which we operate is changing.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communications equipment industry is subject to regulation in the United States and other countries. Our business is dependent upon the continued growth of
the telecommunications industry in the United States and internationally. Federal and state regulatory agencies regulate most of our domestic customers. In early 1996, the U.S. Telecommunications Act
of 1996 was enacted. The Telecommunications Act lifted certain restrictions on the ability of companies, including the Regional Bell Operating Companies and other customers of ours, to compete with
one another. The Telecommunications Act also made other significant changes in the regulation of the telecommunications industry. While we believe that these changes could increase our opportunities
to provide solutions for our customers' Internet/data, video and voice needs, this result is dependent on the reaction of our existing and prospective customers to these new regulatory trends. The
full impact of these regulatory changes on the market for our products is difficult to predict; however, competition in our markets could intensify as a result of the changes in regulation. Changes in
current or future laws or regulations in the United States or elsewhere could adversely affect our business.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Conditions in international markets could affect our operations.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our international sales accounted for approximately 23% of our net sales in fiscal 1999, 22% of our net sales in fiscal 1998 and 21% of our net sales in fiscal
1997. We expect international sales to increase as a percentage of net sales in the future. In addition to sales and distribution in numerous countries, we own or subcontract operations located in
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Due to our international sales and our international manufacturing and software development
operations, we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally. These risks include:</FONT></P>

are also subject to general geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. We maintain business operations and
have sales in many international markets. Economic conditions in many of these markets represent significant risks to us. We cannot predict whether our sales and business operations in these markets
will be adversely affected by these conditions. Instability in foreign markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Potential turmoil in
the Middle East could also negatively impact our results of operations for our ADC Teledata Communications, Ltd. subsidiary, located in Herzliya, Israel. In addition to the effect of international
economic instability on foreign sales, domestic sales to U.S. customers having significant foreign operations could be adversely impacted by these economic conditions. These factors may materially and
adversely affect our business and operating results in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>We may face higher costs associated with protecting our intellectual property.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and
trade secrets, our future success will depend upon product development, technological expertise and distribution channels. We cannot predict whether we can protect our technology, or whether
competitors can develop similar technology independently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
the competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap, we believe that companies in the
communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. We have received and may continue to receive from third parties, including some of our competitors, notices
claiming that we are infringing third-party patents or other proprietary rights. We cannot predict that we will prevail in any litigation over third-party claims, or that we will be able to license
any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, divert our management's time, attention and
resources, delay our product shipments, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. A third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable
terms, if at all. If a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non-infringing technology, our business and operating results could
be adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>We may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify
suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms,
if at all. If we acquire a company, we may have difficulty assimilating its businesses, products, services, technologies and personnel into our operations. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing
business, distract our management and workforce, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay
for future acquisitions or investments. The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our shareowners.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our products, systems and sales may be subject to Year 2000 problems.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many currently installed computer systems and software are coded to accept only two digit entries in date code fields. These date code fields will need to
accept four-digit entries to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. As a result, many companies' computer systems and software will need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply
with Year 2000 requirements. The potential global impact of the Year 2000 problem is not known, and, if not corrected in a timely manner, could affect us and the U.S. and world economy generally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we believe our current products and systems are Year 2000 ready, our products operate in complex network environments and directly or indirectly interact with a number of
other hardware and software systems. Despite preliminary testing, we cannot predict all of the possible Year 2000 issues arising from the interaction of our products with older hardware and software
systems. Even though we have requested assurances from our major suppliers and customers that they have adequately addressed Year 2000 issues, it is impossible to fully assess the potential
consequences in the event that service interruptions from suppliers occur or in the event that there are disruptions in such infrastructure areas as utilities, communications, transportation, banking
and government. Known or unknown errors arising from Year 2000 issues could result in a delay or loss of revenue, interruption of service, cancellation of client contracts, diversion of development
resources, damage to our reputation, increased service and warranty costs, and litigation. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and operating results.</FONT></P>
