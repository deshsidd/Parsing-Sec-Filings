                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    AAR  CORP. and its  subsidiaries are referred to  herein collectively as the
"Company," unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company was organized  in
1955  as the successor to  a business founded in  1951 and was reincorporated in
Delaware in 1966. The  Company supplies a variety  of products and services  for
aviation in the United States and abroad.

    Certain  of  the  Company's  aviation-related  activities  and  products are
subject to  licensing,  certification  and other  requirements  imposed  by  the
Federal Aviation Administration and other regulatory agencies, both domestic and
foreign.  The Company believes that it  has all licenses and certifications that
are material to the conduct of its business.

    The Company's trading activities include the  purchase, sale and lease of  a
wide variety of new, used and overhauled aviation products, principally aircraft
equipment  such as engines, avionics, accessories, airframe and engine parts and
components. The Company also provides customized inventory supply and management
programs  for  certain  aircraft  and  engine  parts  in  support  of   customer
maintenance  activities.  The  Company is  also  a distributor  of  new aviation
hardware and  parts. The  Company's  primary sources  of aviation  products  are
domestic  and  foreign  airlines,  independent  aviation  service  companies and
airframe, engine  and  other  original equipment  manufacturers.  The  Company's
trading activities also include the purchase, sale, lease and lease financing of
new and used jet aircraft.

    The Company provides a wide range of services, parts, component exchange and
other  products  as  part of  its  overhaul activities.  The  Company overhauls,
repairs and modifies components for commercial and military aircraft,  including
landing  gear and engine  components for most models  of commercial aircraft. It
provides aircraft terminal services (fueling and aircraft storage), maintenance,
modification,  special  equipment   installation  and   painting  services   for
commercial and business aircraft.

    The   Company  manufactures,  installs   and  repairs  specialized  aviation
products, including pallets, containers, cargo handling systems and  lightweight
air   logistics   shelters,  primarily   for   domestic  and   foreign  military
organizations, airframe manufacturers, commercial airlines and others.

    The Company furnishes Aviation Services directly through its own  employees.
Domestic  and foreign  airlines, airframe,  engine and  other original equipment
manufacturers,  aircraft  leasing  companies,  domestic  and  foreign   military
organizations  and  independent  aviation support  companies  are  the principal
customers for the Company's aviation trading activities. Principal customers  of
the  Company's aviation  overhaul activities  are commercial  airlines, aircraft
leasing  companies,  business  aircraft  operators,  military  overhaul  depots,
military  contractors and  original equipment  manufacturers. Sales  of Aviation
Services to commercial airlines  are generally affected by  such factors as  the
number,  type and  average age  of aircraft in  service, the  levels of aircraft
utilization (E.G., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators  and
the level of sales of new and used aircraft.

    The  Company is a  leading independent supplier of  Aviation Services to the
aviation aftermarket,  which  is highly  competitive.  Competition is  based  on
quality,  ability to provide  a broad range  of products and  services, speed of
delivery and  price.  During the  past  three  years, the  demand  for  aviation
aftermarket  products and services improved, particularly  in the latter half of
this period. At the  beginning of this  three-year period, airlines  experienced
significant  financial losses from reduced  traffic demands and increased costs.
As a result, airlines curtailed purchases and reduced or, in some cases,  ceased
operations, leading to a decline in demand for aviation

                                       2
<PAGE>
aftermarket products and services during the early 1990s. This decline in demand
was  exacerbated by  the availability  of parts  from grounded  aircraft, excess
airline inventories and material from airlines that ceased operations.

    Demand improved during the last half of this period as airlines,  generally,
experienced  increased revenue  passenger and freight  miles, increased aircraft
fleet utilization,  and  in many  cases,  returned to  operating  profitability.
During  this period of improvement,  start-up airlines emerged in niche-markets,
began to  record  operating  earnings  and, in  some  instances,  are  expanding
operations.  The improvement in the operating results of many airlines stem from
increased traffic demands, internal cost  controls and from outsourcing  certain
support activities to third party providers. Additionally, the supply of surplus
aircraft and parts inventories that increased during the industry downturn, have
begun  to be absorbed at a faster  rate due to increased utilization of aircraft
fleets by airlines and conversion of aircraft to alternative uses.

    Aerospace and  defense manufacturers  also experienced  lower demand  during
this  three year period  due to reduced  and cancelled orders  for new aircraft.
While this reduced demand still exists, increases in orders for new aircraft are
expected over the  next few years.  Also during this  period, government  budget
cuts  resulted  in  a  downsizing  of the  United  States  military.  While this
downsizing adversely  effected  the aerospace/aviation  industry,  the  military
continues  to require products to  support ongoing rapid deployment requirements
and services previously performed within the military.

    The Company  competes with  other independent  distributors and  independent
support   facilities,  as   well  as   with  airlines   and  original  equipment
manufacturers, including aerospace equipment  manufacturers, some of which  have
greater resources than the Company. In certain of its leasing and commercial jet
aircraft  trading  activities,  the  Company  faces  competition  from financial
institutions, syndicators,  commercial  and specialized  leasing  companies  and
other entities that provide financing, some of which have greater resources than
the  Company. The Company believes it  has maintained a satisfactory competitive
position.

    In addition  to its  aviation-related activities,  the Company  manufactures
highly  engineered proprietary products, including industrial floor cleaning and
material handling equipment  and nuclear shielding  material. The Company  sells
these  products directly and through independent  distributors to a wide variety
of commercial customers and  domestic and foreign  governments. The markets  for
these products are highly competitive, based on price, quality and availability.

    At  May 31, 1995, backlog believed  to be firm was approximately $79,407,000
compared to $84,550,000 at May 31,  1994. An additional $85,076,000 of  unfunded
government  options on awarded  contracts also existed  at May 31,  1995. Of the
1995 year-end backlog that  is firm, $23,460,000  is attributable to  government
contracts  for  products  related  to  the  U.S.  Government's  rapid deployment
programs. It is expected that approximately  $68,188,000 of the backlog will  be
shipped in fiscal 1996.

    Sales  to the  United States government,  its agencies,  and its contractors
were approximately $82,708,000 (18.3% of total net sales), $77,500,000 (19.0% of
total net sales) and $57,600,000 (15.0% of total net sales) in fiscal 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively. Because  such sales are  subject to competitive  bidding
and  government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue
at levels  previously  experienced. The  majority  of the  Company's  government
contracts  are  for  aviation products  and  services used  for  ongoing routine
military logistic  support activities;  unlike weapons  systems and  other  high
technology military requirements, these products and services are less likely to
be  affected by reductions in defense spending. The Company's contracts with the
United States  government and  its  agencies are  typically firm  agreements  to
provide  aviation products and services at a fixed  price and have a term of one
year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods
of one  year at  the option  of the  government agency.  Although the  Company's
government contracts are subject to termination at

                                       3
<PAGE>
the  election of the government, in the  event of such a termination the Company
would be entitled to recover from the government all allowable costs incurred by
the Company through the date of termination.

    At May 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately 1,940 persons worldwide.

    For  information  concerning  the  Company's  Business  Segment  activities,
including  classes of similar  products and services,  see Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations."  For
information  concerning export sales, see "Business Segment Information" in Note
1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    Aviation trading activities are conducted from three buildings in Elk  Grove
Village,  Illinois, one owned  by the Company, another  subject to an industrial
revenue bond mortgage until June 1, 1995 and the third is leased. In addition to
warehouse space,  which  is  mechanized  for efficient  access  to  the  diverse
inventory,  these  facilities include  executive  offices, sales  offices  and a
service center.  Warehouse facilities  are leased  in Cerritos,  California  and
Hawthorne,  New York  for the purpose  of aviation hardware  distribution and in
Hamburg, Germany and Nantgarw, United Kingdom  for the purpose of aviation  part
and component distribution.

    Aviation  overhaul facilities are  located in The  Netherlands near Schiphol
International Airport (in  a building owned  by the Company);  Garden City,  New
York  (in a building owned  by the Company); Frankfort,  New York (subject to an
industrial revenue  bond lease  to the  Company until  2001, at  which time  the
Company  shall  purchase the  facility  for a  nominal  consideration); Windsor,
Connecticut (in a  building owned  by the  Company); Miami,  Florida (in  leased
facilities near the airport); Singapore (in leased facilities near the airport);
London, England (in leased facilities); Paris, France (in leased facilities) and
Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma  (in facilities  leased from  airport authorities). The
Company's experience indicates  that lease  renewal is  available on  reasonable
terms consistent with its business needs.

    The  Company's  principal manufacturing  activities  are conducted  at owned
facilities in  Port  Jervis,  New  York, and  Cadillac  and  Livonia,  Michigan.
Industrial  floor  cleaning  equipment is  manufactured  in a  plant  located in
Aberdeen, North Carolina  (subject to an  industrial revenue bond  lease to  the
Company  until  October 1994,  following which  the  Company shall  purchase the
facility for a nominal consideration).

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company  is not  a party  to any  pending legal  proceedings other  than
routine litigation incidental to its business.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
        STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

    The Company's Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and  the
Chicago  Stock  Exchange.  On June  30,  1995, there  were  approximately 12,000
holders of the Common Stock of  the Company, including participants in  security
position listings.

    Certain  of the Company's debt agreements contain provisions restricting the
payment of  dividends or  repurchase  of its  shares. See  Note  2 of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Under the most restrictive of
these provisions, the Company may not pay dividends (other than stock dividends)
or  acquire  its capital  stock  if after  giving  effect thereto  the aggregate
amounts paid on or  after June 1,  1995 exceed the sum  of (i) $20,000,000  plus
(ii)  50% of Consolidated Net  Income of the Company after  June 1, 1994. At May
31, 1995, unrestricted consolidated retained  earnings available for payment  of
dividends   and  purchase   of  the  Company's   shares  totalled  approximately
$20,000,000. Effective June 1, 1995 unrestricted consolidated retained  earnings
increased  to $25,232,000 due to inclusion of  50% of Consolidated Net Income of
the Company for fiscal 1995.

    The table below sets forth for each quarter of the fiscal year indicated the
reported high and low sales price of the Company's Common Stock on the New  York

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    The Company  reports  its  activities  in  one  business  segment:  Aviation
Services.  The table  below sets  forth net sales  for the  Company's classes of
similar products and  services within this  segment for each  of the last  three
fiscal years ended May 31.

THREE-YEAR NET SALES SUMMARY

    The  comparison of net sales of the Company over the last three fiscal years
covers  a  period  of  improving  general  economic  conditions,  and  improving
conditions  in the aerospace/aviation  industry. Airlines continue  to strive to
improve their financial condition which was  weakened due to an extended  period
of  operating  losses  during the  early  1990s. Airlines  are  now experiencing
increased aircraft fleet utilization and increased revenue passenger and freight
miles,  which  are  contributing  to  improved  operating  earnings.   Airlines'
operating  earnings are also being positively affected by their aggressive steps
to control costs through restructuring operations, exiting unprofitable  routes,
and by outsourcing certain support activities to third party providers. Start-up
airlines  emerged  in  niche-markets  during this  period  and  began  to record
operating earnings and, in some instances, are expanding operations. Supplies of
surplus aircraft  and  parts  inventories that  increased  during  the  industry
downturn,  are now  being absorbed  at a faster  rate due  to increased aircraft
utilization and  conversion  of  aircraft  to  alternate  uses,  such  as  cargo
capabilities.  In fiscal 1995  and 1994, the  Company's revenues benefitted from
aggressive pursuit of market  opportunities in the improving  aerospace/aviation
industry.  The Company's  trading sales  of airframe  and large  component parts
increased  as  did  sales  from  inventory  management  programs  and  inventory
provisioning  for  start-up airlines.  Sales of  certain airframe  and component
overhaul services,  as  well  as manufactured  commercial  cargo  systems,  also
improved in fiscal 1995.

    Aerospace/aviation manufacturers and certain defense contractors experienced
delays  and cancellations of new aircraft orders and other manufactured aviation
products during this  period. This  decreased demand  resulted in  a decline  in
Company sales of aviation fasteners for the first two years of the period. These
sales  have now  stabilized and aerospace/aviation  manufacturers are projecting
increases in new aircraft  orders over the next  few years which should  provide
increased  aviation fastener demand. Also, government  budget cuts resulted in a
downsizing of  the  United  States military.  While  this  downsizing  adversely
affected  the aerospace/aviation  industry generally, the  military continues to
require products to support ongoing  rapid deployment requirements and  services
previously  performed  within  the  military. The  Company's  response  to these
changed requirements has resulted in  increased sales of manufactured  products.
The  Company's  sales  of  overhaul  services  also  benefitted  from government
outsourcing of certain activities previously performed within the military.

    The difficult  general economic  conditions during  the early  part of  this
three  year  period also  adversely affected  the Company's  nonaviation related
businesses.  As   the  general   business  environment   improved  the   Company
aggressively  pursued availing  business opportunities  in response  to changing
customer needs,  which  resulted  in  increased sales  of  the  Company's  floor
maintenance products and overhaul services on industrial gas turbines during the
latter part of fiscal 1994 and during fiscal 1995.

<PAGE>
    The  Company believes that  its established market  position, its ability to
respond to changes in  the industry and its  diverse customer base coupled  with
continued  improvement in the aerospace/aviation industry, positions the Company
to take advantage of opportunities in improving markets.

</TABLE>

FISCAL 1995 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1994

    The Company's operating results continued to improve in fiscal 1995 building
on improvements  in the  prior  year. Consolidated  net  sales for  fiscal  1995
increased  $43,641,000 or  10.7% over  the prior  fiscal year,  primarily due to
increased sales of major products within each of the classes of similar products
and services. Operating income increased $2,614,000 or 11.9% over the prior year
due to increased  consolidated net sales  partially offset by  a slightly  lower
consolidated  gross  profit  margin  and increased  total  selling,  general and
administrative costs. Net income  increased $969,000 or  10.2% primarily due  to
increased consolidated net sales partially offset by the factors described above
and  increased  interest expense  on additional  borrowings and  higher interest
rates, primarily resulting from the sale of $50 million of 10 year, 7 1/4% notes
in October 1993.

    Trading sales  increased  $28,162,000 or  13.5%  primarily as  a  result  of
increased sales of airframe and large component parts as well as sales resulting
from  inventory  management  programs  and  inventory  provisioning  of start-up
airlines. Overhaul sales increased $5,765,000 or  5.6% primarily as a result  of
increased  airframe and airframe component overhaul services partially offset by
reduced  sales  of  large  component  overhaul  services.  Manufacturing   sales
increased  $9,714,000  or  10.1%  primarily  due  to  the  sale  of manufactured
commercial cargo systems,  products and  product repairs  supporting the  United
States governments' rapid deployment program and floor maintenance products.

    Consolidated gross profit increased $5,961,000 or 8.3% over the prior fiscal
year  due to increased  consolidated net sales,  although the consolidated gross
profit margin  of 17.3%  was lower  than  the prior  year's 17.6%  gross  profit
margin. However, the prior fiscal year included $700,000 from a reduction in the
interest  rate on a  nonrecourse leveraged lease  obligation and $1,300,000 from
leveraged lease repricing  required to  adjust for tax  rate differentials.  The
margin  on manufactured products  and principal trading  products increased year
over year. Overhaul margins declined over  the prior year primarily as a  result
of  changes in  the mix  of labor  and parts  provided in  overhaul services and
highly competitive pricing on overhaul business.

    Consolidated operating income increased $2,614,000  or 11.9% over the  prior
year   due  to  increased  consolidated  net   sales  partially  offset  by  the
consolidated margin decline described above  and increased selling, general  and
administrative costs which declined as a percentage of net sales.

    Consolidated  net income increased $969,000 or 10.2% over the prior year due
to the  increased  consolidated  net  sales  partially  offset  by  the  factors
described above and increased interest expense.

<PAGE>
FISCAL 1994 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1993

    The  Company's operating results improved in  fiscal 1994 despite the highly
competitive and economically  weak aerospace/aviation  market. Consolidated  net
sales  for fiscal 1994 increased $24,974,000 or  6.5% over the prior fiscal year
primarily as a result of increased manufacturing and overhaul sales. Net  income
increased  $9,211,000 over the prior year, which included restructuring expenses
of $11,000,000  ($7,200,000 after  tax)  related to  the write-down  of  certain
inventories.  Excluding restructuring expenses,  net income increased $2,011,000
or 26.9%  as the  result of  sales increases  and reduced  selling, general  and
administrative costs.

    Manufacturing  sales increased $18,287,000 or 23.5%, primarily from the sale
of products  to the  U.S. government.  Overhaul sales  increased $10,082,000  or
10.9%  due to  increased demand  for maintenance  services at  the Oklahoma City
facility and increased sales  of rotable landing  gear inventory. Trading  sales
increased  in its primary products, such  as airframe and engine parts; however,
these gains  were  offset by  reduced  demand  for aviation  fasteners  and  the
Company's  decision not  to enter  into fastener  programs requiring significant
inventory investment  with  uncertain  returns. These  factors  resulted  in  an
overall decline in trading sales of $3,395,000 or 1.6%.

    Consolidated  gross profit increased $3,474,000 or  5.1% over the prior year
primarily due to increased sales revenue. Fiscal 1994 consolidated gross  profit
included  $700,000  from  a reduction  in  the  interest rate  on  a nonrecourse
leveraged lease  obligation  negotiated  by the  Company,  and  $1,300,000  from
leveraged  lease repricing  required to adjust  for tax  rate differentials. The
consolidated gross profit margin  was slightly lower than  the prior year,  down
from  17.9% to 17.6%. Trading and  manufacturing margins improved year over year
while overhaul  margins  declined.  The  overhaul  margin  decline  was  due  to
increased  price  competition  resulting from  maintenance  overcapacity  in the
industry and  airlines using  lower-cost serviceable  replacement components  in
preference to overhaul services.

    Consolidated  operating income  increased $16,481,000  over the  prior year.
Without the fiscal 1993 restructuring expenses of $11,000,000, operating  income
increased  $5,481,000  or  33.5% due  primarily  to  the increased  sales  and a
reduction of  $2,007,000  in  selling, general  and  administrative  costs.  The
Company maintained its effort to contain costs, reduce nonessential spending and
create operating efficiencies wherever possible.

    Consolidated  net  income  increased  $9,211,000  notwithstanding  increased
interest expense of $1,457,000  due to higher fixed-rate  interest on debt  from
the  issuance of  $50 million  of new 7.25%  long-term notes  issued in October,
1993. Proceeds from this fixed-rate debt  repaid $28 million of short-term  bank
borrowings  at lower interest rates. Higher  margins on fiscal 1994 export sales
reduced the  effective  tax rate,  which  also  contributed to  the  net  income
increase.

FISCAL 1993

    Consolidated  net sales for fiscal 1993 decreased $39,877,000 or 9% from the
prior fiscal year. Net income decreased $9,737,000  or 97% as the result of  the
sales  decrease, restructuring expenses of $11,000,000 (or $7,200,000 after tax)
and a reduction in the consolidated  gross profit margin. The operating  results
of  each major business activity  in fiscal 1993 were  adversely affected by the
continued weak  economic  environment, particularly  in  the  aerospace/aviation
market.

    Trading  activities benefitted from increased sales of its primary products,
such as airframe  and engine  parts. Even  with these  increases, trading  sales
decreased  $6,946,000  or  3%,  primarily due  to  reduced  demand  for aviation
fasteners.  The  sales  of  overhaul  services  decreased  $13,986,000  or  12%,
primarily  as a result of lower demand and the effect of downsizing the Oklahoma
City maintenance facility. The  lower demand was  caused by airlines  downsizing
their  active  fleets,  focusing  on  lowering  maintenance  costs,  maintenance
overcapacity in the industry

and  airlines  using   lower-cost  serviceable  components,   abundant  in   the
marketplace,  in preference  to overhauling  certain units.  Manufacturing sales
decreased $18,945,000, or  20%; however,  it should  be noted  that fiscal  1992
included  $11,000,000  of  non-recurring  product  sales  for  the  Persian Gulf
conflict. Sales for the government's  rapid deployment program increased  during
fiscal  1993 and  the order  backlog was  higher at  the end  of fiscal  1993 as
compared to the same period in fiscal  1992. Further, sales were reduced due  to
the  reduction and deferral of orders for commercial and military aircraft cargo
systems and spare  parts, and  lower sales  at the  Company's floor  maintenance
equipment unit due to a recession-induced decline in demand, intense competition
and the effect of converting to a direct distribution system in Europe.

    Consolidated gross profit decreased $15,004,000 or 18% from the prior fiscal
year  due to a  reduction in sales  and a decrease  in consolidated gross profit
margin from 19.7%  to 17.9%. Lower  production and sales  levels in relation  to
fixed  costs at  a few  units, as  well as  increased competition,  hampered the
margin.  The  Company  reduced  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses
$4,817,000  or 8%  in response  to a  decrease in  sales and  competitive market
conditions. The Company continued its focus on cost containment and  improvement
in operating efficiencies in an effort to maintain its operating margins.

    In  February, 1993  the Company  recorded noncash  restructuring expenses of
$11,000,000 for the writedown of  certain inventories and associated costs.  The
inventories  most  affected  were  parts  for  older-model  commercial aircraft,
certain  manufactured  products  and  material  supporting  original   equipment
manufacturers.  The  writedown resulted  from  the Company's  assessment  of the
impact on  inventories of  then very  recent changes  in the  aerospace/aviation
market, as well as the continued recessionary environment.

    The  income tax  benefit of $2,200,000  reported in fiscal  1993 included an
expense reduction of $1,200,000 from the reversal of income tax liabilities. The
income tax benefit before the expense reduction was higher than that  determined
using  the statutory  rate as  the result  of state  income tax  refunds and the
effect of tax  benefits on  exempt earnings from  export sales.  The income  tax
expense reduction was for income tax liabilities recorded in prior years, but no
longer  required due to  the conclusion by  the Internal Revenue  Service of its
examination of the Company's Federal income tax returns for prior years.

                              FINANCIAL CONDITION

AT MAY 31, 1995 COMPARED WITH MAY 31, 1994

    In fiscal 1995 the  Company generated $15,255,000  of cash from  operations,
primarily  in the last half  of the fiscal year,  through increased earnings and
effective working  capital management.  The Company  also issued  $6,186,000  of
long-term  debt bearing an interest rate of  5% in conjunction with the purchase
of inventory to  support long-term  inventory management  programs. The  overall
cash  and  cash  equivalents position  of  the Company  increased  $4,413,000 to
$22,487,000 at fiscal year  end. The increase in  cash and cash equivalents  was
accomplished  while making $9,073,000 of capital improvements, paying $7,650,000
in dividends and  carrying increased  trade accounts  receivable of  $23,375,000
stemming from record sales in the last quarter of the fiscal year.

    The  Company's  financial  position  continued to  improve  in  fiscal 1995.
Working  capital  increased  $8,483,000,  average  short-term  borrowings   were
reduced,  and the ratio  of long-term debt to  capitalization improved to 37.8%.
The Company believes that its improved financial condition, along with available
sources of  financing, including  its unused  bank credit  lines and  facilities
amounting  to  $133,750,000, will  enable the  Company  to meet  its anticipated
working capital requirements and pursue advantageous business opportunities.

                              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
  OF AAR CORP.:

    We have audited the  accompanying consolidated balance  sheets of AAR  CORP.
and  subsidiaries  as of  May 31,  1995  and 1994  and the  related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the  three-year  period ended  May  31, 1995.  These  consolidated  financial
statements   are   the   responsibility  of   the   Company's   management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

    We  conducted  our audits  in  accordance with  generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also  includes
assessing  the  accounting principles  used  and significant  estimates  made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In  our  opinion, the  consolidated financial  statements referred  to above
present fairly, in all  material respects, the financial  position of AAR  CORP.
and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of their operations
and  their cash flows for  each of the years in  the three-year period ended May
31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the  Financial Accounting Standards Board's  Statement
of  Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.  109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES,

statements,  the Company also adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards  Board's  SFAS  No.  106,  EMPLOYERS'  ACCOUNTING  FOR  POSTRETIREMENT
BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, as of June 1, 1993.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

    The  accompanying consolidated financial statements  include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts  and
transactions.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

    Sales  and related cost  of sales are recognized  primarily upon shipment of
products and  performance  of services.  Sales  and  related cost  of  sales  on
long-term  contracts are  recognized as units  are delivered,  determined by the
percentage of completion method based on  the relationship of costs incurred  to
date  to estimated total costs under  the respective contracts. Lease revenue is
recognized as earned.

  ACCOUNTING CHANGES

    Effective June 1, 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 109 "Accounting  for Income Taxes." Prior years'  results
were  not restated.  The cumulative  effect of the  accounting change  was a tax
benefit of $900,000 ($.06  per share) recorded in  the three month period  ended
August  31, 1993. The adoption  of SFAS No. 109  changes the Company's method of
accounting for income taxes  from the deferred  method of Accounting  Principles
Board  Opinion ("APB") No. 11  to the asset and  liability method of accounting.
Under the asset and  liability method, deferred tax  assets and liabilities  are
recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences
between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and  liabilities
are  measured using statutory  tax rates in  effect for the  year in which those
temporary differences are  expected to be  recovered or settled.  The effect  on
deferred  tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates will be recognized
in the consolidated results  of operations for the  period in which the  changes
occurred. Pursuant to the deferred method under APB No. 11, which was applied in
1993  and  prior years,  deferred  income taxes  are  recognized for  income and
expense items that are reported in  different years for financial reporting  and
income  tax purposes using the tax rate  applicable for the year of calculation.
Under the  deferred  method, deferred  taxes  are not  adjusted  for  subsequent
changes in tax rates.

    Effective  June  1,  1993  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106 "Employers'
Accounting for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other  than  Pensions."  Prior  years'
results  were not restated. SFAS No. 106 requires that the projected future cost
of nonpension postretirement benefits be  recognized as an expense as  employees
render  services instead of when claims are incurred, as the Company had done in
the past. Upon adoption, the Company  elected, as permitted under SFAS No.  106,
to  record a one-time transition obligation of $1,350,000 ($890,000 after tax or
$.06 per share) which  represents that portion of  future retiree benefit  costs
related  to service already rendered by both  active and retired employees up to
the date of adoption. The initial accumulated postretirement benefit  obligation
of  $1,350,000  primarily represented  health  and life  insurance  benefits for
certain current employees and retirees.

    In fiscal 1995 the Company adopted  SFAS No. 112 "Employers' Accounting  for
Postemployment  Benefits." Prior years' results were not restated. This standard
requires an accrual method of recognizing the costs of providing  postemployment
benefits  relating to employee severance, disability, health and life insurance.
Since the Company either does not  provide such benefits or accounted for  those
benefits  provided  on  an accrual  basis,  the cumulative  after-tax  charge of
accruing the cost of  benefits under this statement  was not significant to  the
results of operations in fiscal 1995.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. At May 31, 1995 and 1994 cash equivalents
of  approximately $19,129,000 and  $5,717,000, respectively held  by the Company
represent  investments   in  funds   holding  high-quality   commercial   paper,
Eurodollars and U.S. government agency-issued securities. The carrying amount of
cash equivalents approximates fair value at May 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

  MARKETABLE SECURITIES

    The Company recorded net proceeds of $1,593,000 in fiscal 1993 from the sale
of marketable securities and included a $57,000 net loss determined on the basis
of specific identification in the consolidated results of operations. Marketable
securities were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY

    Gains  and  losses  on  foreign currency  translation  and  foreign exchange
contracts are determined in accordance with the method of accounting  prescribed
by  SFAS No.  52. All  balance sheet  accounts of  foreign and  certain domestic
subsidiaries  transacting  business  in  currencies  other  than  the  Company's
functional  currency  are translated  at year-end  exchange rates.  Revenues and
expenses are translated at average  exchange rates during the year.  Translation
adjustments  are excluded  from the  results of  operations and  are recorded in
Stockholders' equity as Cumulative translation adjustments.

    The Company from time to time uses forward exchange contracts or options  to
hedge  its loss exposure from the translation of foreign subsidiaries results of
operations from  functional  currencies  into  United  States  dollars.  Forward
exchange  contracts or options  losses are included in  results of operations in
the period  the loss  is determinable.  Gains are  recorded when  realized  upon
contract  settlement.  At May  31, 1995  and  during fiscal  1995 there  were no
forward exchange contracts or options outstanding. Foreign and certain  domestic
subsidiaries  incur transaction gains and  losses upon settlement of obligations
in  currencies  other  than  their   functional  currency.  The  aggregate   net
transaction   gains  (losses),  including  those  related  to  forward  exchange
contracts, reported  in  results  of operations  were  $45,000,  $(32,000),  and
$(578,000) for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF MARKET OR CREDIT RISK

    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of  market or credit  risk consist principally of  forward exchange contracts or
options and trade  receivables. The forward  exchange contracts discussed  above
subject  the Company to  market risk from  exchange rate movements. Accordingly,
the Company recognizes losses in the period such losses are determinable.  While
the  Company's trade receivables are diverse based on the number of entities and
geographic locations, the  majority are concentrated  in the  aerospace/aviation
industry.  The Company  performs evaluations  of customers'  financial condition
prior to extending credit privileges and performs on-going credit evaluations of
payment experience, current financial condition, and risk analysis. The  Company
typically  requires  collateral  in the  form  of security  interest  in assets,
letters of  credit, or  obligation guarantees  from financial  institutions  for
transactions other than normal trade terms.

    SFAS  No.  107  "Disclosures  About Fair  Value  of  Financial Instruments,"
requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable,

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
short-term borrowing, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected  in
the  financial statements  at fair value  because of the  short-term maturity of
these instruments. Non-current  notes receivable  and long-term  debt bearing  a
variable  interest rate are reflected in the financial statements at fair value.
Those bearing a fixed  interest rate have fair  values based on estimates  using
discounted future cash flows at an assumed discount rate for borrowing currently
prevailing in the marketplace for similar instruments.

    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant
market   information  about  the  financial   instrument.  These  estimates  are
subjective in  nature  and  involve uncertainties  and  matters  of  significant
judgement  and  therefore  cannot  be  determined  with  precision.  Changes  in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

  INVENTORIES

    Inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by
either the specific identification, average cost, or first-in, first-out method.
Inventoried costs relating to long-term contracts and programs are stated at the
actual production costs, including factory burden and initial tooling,  incurred
to  date,  reduced  by  amounts  identified  with  revenue  recognized  on units
delivered. The costs attributed to units delivered under long-term contracts and
programs are based on the  estimated average cost of  all units scheduled to  be
produced. Progress billings under government contracts are based on an allowable
percentage  of  the  cost of  material  received  and labor  and  factory burden
incurred.

</TABLE>

  EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES

    Lease revenue is recognized as earned. The cost of the asset under lease  is
original  purchase  price  plus  overhaul costs.  Depreciation  of  the  cost is
computed on  a straight-line  method  over the  estimated  service life  of  the
equipment.  Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The assets are available
for sale at  the end of  each lease  term. The balance  sheet classification  is
based  on  the lease  term. Leases  with a  fixed term  under twelve  months are
considered short-term and all others are classified as long-term.

    Equipment on short-term lease consists of  aircraft engines and parts on  or
available  for lease to satisfy  immediate short-term customer requirements. The
leases are renewable  with fixed  terms, which generally  vary from  one to  six
months.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

    Depreciation  is computed on  the straight-line method  over useful lives of
10-40 years  for  buildings  and  improvements and  3-10  years  for  equipment,
furniture  and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the estimated
useful life or the term of the applicable lease.

    Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Upon sale  or
disposal,  cost and accumulated  depreciation are removed  from the accounts and
related gains and losses included in results of operations.

  LEVERAGED LEASES

    The Company acts as an  equity participant in leveraged lease  transactions.
The  equipment cost in excess of equity contribution is furnished by third party
financing in the  form of secured  debt. Under the  lease agreements, the  third
parties have no recourse against the Company for non-payment of the obligations.
The  third party debt  is collateralized by the  lessees' rental obligations and
the leased equipment. The Company has ownership rights to the leased assets  and
is  entitled to the investment  tax credits, and benefits  of tax deductions for
depreciation on  the  leased  assets  and  for  interest  on  the  secured  debt
financing.

  COST IN EXCESS OF UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES

    The  cost in excess of underlying net  assets of companies acquired is being
amortized over a period of forty years. Amortization was $230,000, $240,000  and
$240,000  in fiscal 1995, 1994  and 1993, respectively. Accumulated amortization
is $3,155,000,  $2,950,000  and $2,710,000  at  May  31, 1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.

  INCOME TAXES

    Income  taxes are  determined in  accordance with  the method  of accounting
prescribed by SFAS No. 109.

    Federal income  taxes are  not  provided on  the undistributed  earnings  of
certain  foreign subsidiaries (approximately $15,200,000  and $14,600,000 at May
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively), as it is the Company's intention to reinvest a
portion of these earnings indefinitely in  the foreign operations. From time  to
time,  as the earnings are treated as  taxable in the United States, the related
tax expense would be offset substantially by foreign tax credits. Foreign income
taxes are provided  at the  local statutory  rates and  reflect estimated  taxes
payable.

    The  benefits of  investment tax  credits are  recognized for  book purposes
under the deferral method of accounting for leveraged leases. The investment tax
credits are recognized in the year earned for income tax purposes.

    The  Company is subject to a number  of covenants under the revolving credit
and term loan agreements, including restrictions which relate to the payment  of
cash  dividends, maintenance  of minimum  net working  capital and  tangible net
worth levels, sales of assets,  additional financing, purchase of the  Company's
shares  and other  matters. The  Company is  in compliance  with all restrictive
financial  provisions  of  the  agreements.   At  May  31,  1995,   unrestricted
consolidated  retained earnings available for  payment of dividends and purchase
of the Company's shares was  approximately $20,000,000. Effective June 1,  1995,
unrestricted  consolidated  retained earnings  increased  to $25,232,000  due to
inclusion of 50% of the consolidated net income of the Company for fiscal 1995.

    The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing during each of the next five
fiscal years is  $1,632,000 in  1996, $1,474,000  in 1997,  $1,474,000 in  1998,

depreciation and  leveraged  leases.  Refundable income  taxes  included  within
Deferred  tax  assets,  deposits  and other,  principally  represent  refunds of
Federal income  taxes  resulting from  additional  tax benefits  generated  from
export  sales  and foreign  tax credits  carried back  to prior  years. Interest
income relating to refundable income  taxes was $371,000, $576,000 and  $390,000
for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

</TABLE>

    The  provision for income taxes was reduced by $1,200,000 in fiscal 1993 due
to the reversal of tax liabilities previously recorded but no longer required as
the result  of  the resolution  of  issues  arising from  the  Internal  Revenue
Service's  examination of  the Federal income  tax returns for  the fiscal years
1979 through 1989. The  years are now closed  to assessments, therefore  certain
tax  accruals previously provided are no longer required. The fiscal 1993 income
tax benefit  before the  reversal  of tax  liabilities on  consolidated  pre-tax
income  was higher  than the  statutory rate  primarily as  the result  of state
income tax refunds received  and the effect of  tax benefits on exempt  earnings
from export sales.

    Pretax   income  from  foreign   subsidiaries  was  approximately  $600,000,
$1,300,000 and $1,200,000 at  May 31, 1995, 1994  and 1993, respectively.  Total
foreign  income taxes provided were in excess  of total local statutory rates in
fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 due  to net operating losses of certain  subsidiaries
not deductible for tax purposes.

    The options are granted at prices equal  to the closing market price on  the
date of grant, become exercisable at such times as may be specified by the Board
of  Directors or as otherwise provided by  the applicable stock option plan, and
expire five to ten years from date of grant. Upon exercise of stock options, the
excess of the proceeds over par value, or cost in the case of treasury stock, is
credited to Capital surplus in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    The AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan  also provides for the grant of  restricted
stock  awards. Restrictions  are released  at the  end of  applicable restricted
periods. The number of shares and  the restricted period, which varies from  two
to  ten years,  are determined  by the  Compensation Committee  of the  Board of
Directors. The market value of the award on  the date of grant is recorded as  a
deferred  expense, common  stock and  capital surplus.  The deferred  expense is
included in results of operations over the restricted term. The expense relating
to outstanding restricted stock  awards was $266,000,  $538,000 and $610,000  in
fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    The  AAR CORP. Employee Stock Purchase Plan  is open to all employees of the
Company (other than officers,  directors or participants  in other stock  option
plans  of the Company) with six months of service. The plan permits employees to
purchase common stock  in periodic offerings  at the lesser  of the fair  market
value  on  date of  offering or  85% of  the fair  market value  on the  date of
exercise. A participating employee pays for  shares by payroll deduction over  a
two-year  period. Upon  completion of the  purchase, the excess  of the proceeds
over the  par value  (or cost  in the  case of  treasury stock)  is credited  to
capital surplus.

    Pursuant to a shareholder rights plan  adopted in 1987 and amended in  1989,
each  outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock carries with it a Right to
purchase one  additional share  at  a price  of  $85 (subject  to  anti-dilution
adjustments).  The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when
certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 20% or more of  the
common stock by a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") or the commencement of
a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the Common Stock.

    In  the event that  an Acquiring Person  acquires 20% or  more of the Common
Stock, or if the Company is the  surviving corporation in a merger involving  an
Acquiring  Person,  or  if the  Acquiring  Person  engages in  certain  types of
self-dealing transactions, each Right  entitles the holder  to purchase for  $85
(or the then current exercise price) shares of the Company's Common Stock having
a  market value of  $170 (or two  times the exercise  price), subject to certain
exceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other  business
combination  or 50% or more  of its assets or earning  power is sold, each Right
entitles the holder to purchase at  the then current exercise price that  number
of  shares of Common Stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of
two times  the exercise  price. The  Rights,  which do  not entitle  the  holder
thereof  to vote or  to receive dividends, expire  on August 6,  1997 and may be
redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right under certain circumstances.

    On September 21,  1990, the  Board of  Directors authorized  the Company  to
purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock on the open market
or through privately negotiated transactions. As of May 31, 1995 the Company had
purchased  322,721 shares of Common Stock on  the open market under this program
at an average price of $11.57 per share.

5.  NET INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

    Primary net  income per  share is  computed by  dividing net  income by  the
weighted  average number of shares of  common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during the year. Shares granted as restricted stock awards under The
AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan are considered outstanding from the date of  grant.
Common  Stock equivalents consist of the  average number of shares issuable upon
the exercise of  all dilutive  employee stock  options, less  the common  shares
which  could  have  been purchased,  at  the  average market  price  during each
quarter, with the assumed proceeds from the exercise of the options.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
    The Company  has  defined contribution  or  defined benefit  plans  covering
substantially  all  full-time domestic  employees and  certain employees  in the
Netherlands.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)
  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

    The pension  plans for  domestic salaried  employees have  benefit  formulas
based  primarily on years  of service and compensation.  The pension benefit for
hourly employees is generally based on a  fixed amount per year of service.  The
Company  follows  the  provisions of  SFAS  No. 87,  "Employers'  Accounting for
Pensions," for all domestic operations.

    The Company's funding policy for  domestic plans is to contribute  annually,
at  a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes and
that is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits.  Contributions
are  intended to  provide for  benefits attributed  to service  to date  and for
benefits expected to be earned  in the future. The  assets of the pension  plans
are  invested primarily in  mutual funds, common  stocks, investment grade bonds
and United States government obligations.

    Certain foreign operations of domestic subsidiaries also have pension plans.
In most cases, the plans are defined benefit in nature. Assets of the plans  are
comprised  of insurance contracts. Benefit formulas are similar to those used by
domestic plans. It  is the policy  of these  subsidiaries to fund  at least  the
minimum  amounts required by  local law and regulation.  Effective June 1, 1993,
all non-domestic pension plans have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 87.

    The following  table sets  forth the  plans' funded  status and  the  amount
recognized  in the Company's Consolidated Balance  Sheets. The plans are grouped
according to  the  portion  of  the accumulated  benefit  obligation  funded  as
follows:

long-term rate  of  return  on  assets  is  10.0%  for  fiscal  1995  and  1994.
Unrecognized  net  loss,  prior  service  cost  and  transition  obligation  are
amortized on a  straight line basis  over the estimated  average future  service
period.

    The projected benefit obligation for non-domestic plans are determined using
an  assumed weighted average discount rate of  7.5% and 7.0% for fiscal 1995 and
1994, respectively, and an assumed average compensation increase of 2.0% for the
first 5 years  and 4.0%, thereafter.  The expected long-term  rate of return  on
assets is 6.5% for fiscal 1995 and 1994.

    The  provisions of SFAS No. 87  "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" require
recognition in the balance sheet of an additional minimum liability, equity  and
related  intangible assets for pension plans with accumulated benefits in excess
of plan assets. At May 31, 1995  the Company has a minimum pension liability  of
$3,765,000  reported within  Retirement benefit  obligation in  the Consolidated
Balance Sheet with $1,370,000 charged to Stockholders' equity in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 87.

    Pension expense  charged to  results of  operations includes  the  following

  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

    The  defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended to
qualify as  a 401(k)  plan under  the  Internal Revenue  Code. Under  the  plan,
employees  may contribute  up to  15% of  their pretax  compensation, subject to
applicable regulatory limits. The Company may make matching contributions up  to
6%  of  compensation. Participants  vest  immediately in  Company contributions.
Expense charged to results of operations was $830,000, $800,000 and $430,000  in
fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  LONG TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN

    The long term performance incentive plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee  of the Board of Directors. The  plan provides for incentive awards to
certain key employees designated by the Compensation Committee based on the long
term performance of the Company. No awards were earned under this Plan in fiscal
1995, 1994 nor 1993, therefore, no expense was charged to results of operations.

  DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE AND KEY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND PROFIT SHARING
PLANS

    The Company provides its outside directors with benefits upon retirement  on
or after age 65 provided they have completed at least five years of service as a
director.  Benefits are payable as a quarterly annuity in an amount equal to 25%
of the annual retainer fee payable  by the Company to active outside  directors.
Payment  of benefits commences upon retirement  and continues for a period equal
to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director  to
a  maximum of  ten years,  or death,  whichever occurs  first. The  Company also
provides supplemental retirement  and profit  sharing benefits  for current  and
former  executives  and key  employees to  supplement  benefits provided  by the
Company's other benefit plans.  The plans are not  fully funded and may  require
funding  in the event of a change in control of the Company as determined by the
Company's Board of Directors. Expense charged to results of operations for these

respectively.

  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

    The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible
employees  and retirees under  a variety of plans.  Generally these benefits are
contributory, with retiree contributions  adjusted annually. The  postretirement
plans  are unfunded and the Company has the  right to modify or terminate any of
these plans  in  the  future,  in certain  cases  subject  to  union  bargaining
agreements.

    Effective  June  1,  1993  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106 "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other  Than Pensions."  Prior to  fiscal
year 1994, the Company recognized retiree health and life insurance expense when
benefits  were paid. Prior years' results  were not restated. Upon adoption, the
Company elected  to  record  a  one-time  transition  obligation  of  $1,350,000
($890,000  after tax)  which represents that  portion of  future retiree benefit
costs related to service already rendered  by both active and retired  employees
up  to the date of adoption. In fiscal 1995 the Company completed termination of
postretirement healthcare  and life  insurance benefits  attributable to  future
services  of  collective bargaining  and other  domestic employees.  The Company
recognized an after-tax gain of $250,000  from the reduction in the  accumulated
post retirement benefit obligation related to this termination of benefits.

    Net  periodic postretirement benefit  cost for the years  ended May 31, 1995
and 1994 included the following components:

    The assumed discount  rates used to  measure the accumulated  postretirement
benefit  obligation were 8.5% and  8.0% at May 31,  1995 and 1994, respectively.
The assumed rate of future  increases in health care  costs was 10.7% in  fiscal
1995  and 1994, declining  to 6.0% by the  year 2004 and  remaining at that rate
thereafter. A one percent  increase in the assumed  health care cost trend  rate
would  increase  the  accumulated  postretirement  obligation  by  approximately
$22,000 as of May 31, 1995 and would  not result in a significant change to  the
annual postretirement benefit expense.

7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    The  Company leases certain  facilities and equipment  under agreements that
expire at various  dates through  2011. Rental  expense under  these leases  was
$6,545,000,   $4,840,000  and  $5,320,000   in  fiscal  1995,   1994  and  1993,
respectively.

    Future minimum payments under leases with initial or remaining terms of  one
year  or more at  May 31, 1995  were $5,414,000 for  fiscal 1996, $4,020,000 for
fiscal 1997,  $3,800,000  for  fiscal  1998,  $3,343,000  for  fiscal  1999  and
$4,713,000 for fiscal 2000 and thereafter.

    The   Company  regularly  places  deposits   with  suppliers  on  short-term
commitments to purchase inventory. These conditional contractual commitments are
made in the ordinary course  of business. At May 31,  1995 and 1994 the  Company
had  $2,264,000  and  $10,700,000, respectively,  of  deposits  outstanding with
suppliers.

    The Company is involved in various  claims and legal actions arising in  the
ordinary  course  of  business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  the ultimate
disposition of these  matters will  not have a  material adverse  effect on  the
Company's consolidated financial condition.

9.  RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
    The Company recorded noncash restructuring  expenses of $11,000,000 for  the
writedown  of  certain  inventories and  associated  costs in  fiscal  1993. The
inventories most  affected  were  parts  for  older-model  commercial  aircraft,
certain  manufactured products as well as material supporting original equipment
manufacturers. The  writedown  resulted from  the  Company's assessment  of  the
impact  on inventories of  the changes in the  aerospace/aviation market and the
recessionary economic  environment.  The  noncash  restructuring  expenses  that
established inventory realization reserves (see note 11 in Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements) had a remaining balance  of approximately $979,000 at May
31, 1995. As the inventory for  which the realization reserves were  established
is  disposed  of,  the  realization reserve  balance  is  to  be correspondingly
reduced.

10. AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES
    The Company  is an  owner  participant in  four leveraged  lease  agreements
entered into between March 1986 and May 1988. These agreements cover four narrow
body  commercial  aircraft and  spare parts.  The transactions  involve aircraft
currently operated by major  carriers. The remaining terms  of the leases  range
from  6 to 9 years. The Company's equity investment in these aircraft represents
approximately one third of the  aggregate equipment cost. The remaining  portion
of the equipment cost is financed by third-party nonrecourse debt.

    The  Company has ownership rights  to the equipment subject  to the right of
the lessees to exercise certain  purchase, renewal and termination options.  For
Federal income tax purposes, the Company receives investment tax credits and has
the  benefit of tax deductions for  depreciation on the aggregate equipment cost
and  interest   on   the  nonrecourse   debt.   During  the   early   years   of

10. AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES -- (CONTINUED)
the lease Federal income tax deductions exceeded the lease rental income. In the
later  years of the lease,  rental income will exceed  the deductions. In fiscal
1994, the Company's  Investment in leveraged  leases was repriced  approximately
$2,000,000 for the impact of an interest rate reduction on nonrecourse long-term
debt  secured by aircraft under  leveraged lease, the tax  rate change under the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1993 and  the Company's  AMT position  in
accordance with SFAS No. 13 "Accounting for Leases."

    In  August 1990, the  Company sold a  partial residual interest  in a Boeing
737-300 aircraft currently subject to a leveraged lease. The lease term  expires
in  March  2001. The  principal  portion of  the  proceeds from  this  sale were
received in the form of a $2,000,000  note and are included with Prepaid  income
taxes,  retirement  benefits, notes  receivable  and other  on  the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. This note  has an interest  rate of 9.9%.  The note and  accrued
interest  of $3,600,000 are due  in March 2001. The  carrying amount of the note
receivable approximates its fair value at May 31, 1995.

aircraft leasing activities were as follows:

"this  Agreement", including, without  limitation, such a  reference included in
the term "Loan Documents", shall be deemed  to be a collective reference to  the
Credit  Agreement, this  Amendment and the  Credit Agreement as  amended by this
Amendment. A Default under and as defined in the Credit Agreement as amended  by
this  Amendment  shall  be deemed  to  have  occurred if  any  representation or
warranty made pursuant  to the  foregoing sentence of  this Section  3 shall  be

this Amendment and  the other  Loan Documents  embody the  entire agreement  and
understanding  between  the  parties  hereto and  supersede  any  and  all prior

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

    This  Employment Agreement ("Agreement") made and entered into as of the 1st
day of June, 1994, by and between AAR CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Company"),
and DAVID P. STORCH ("Employee").

    WHEREAS, the  Company  currently employs  Employee  as President  and  Chief
Operating Officer; and

    WHEREAS, Employee is currently an elected director of the Company; and

    WHEREAS,  the  Company  and  Employee desire  to  enter  into  an employment
agreement continuing such employment pursuant to mutually acceptable terms.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein set  forth,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

    1.   EMPLOYMENT.   The Company  hereby employs Employee  and Employee hereby
accepts employment by the Company, upon the terms and subject to the  conditions
hereinafter set forth.

    2.   TERM.  The term of this  Agreement shall commence as of the date hereof
and, unless earlier  terminated as hereinafter  provided, shall end  on May  31,
1997, subject to extension as follows:

           On  each  day after  May 31,  1994, while  the Employee  continues in
       employment hereunder,  the  term  of employment  shall  automatically  be
       extended  for an additional  one-day period so  that on any  day from and
       after June 1, 1994, while the Employee continues in employment hereunder,
       the  term  of  employment  shall  expire  three  years  thereafter  until
       terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.

    3.  DUTIES.

    (a)  Employee shall have the title, duties and responsibilities of President
and Chief Operating Officer  and such other duties  and responsibilities as  may
from  time  to  time  be  assigned that  are  consistent  with  such  duties and
responsibilities and shall report to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company.

    (b) Employee agrees to  do and perform all  such acts and duties  faithfully
and  diligently and to furnish such services as the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer may  from time  to time  direct,  and do  and perform  all acts  in  the
ordinary  course of business of  the Company (within such  limits as the Company
may prescribe) necessary and conducive to the best interest of the Company.

    (c) Employee  agrees  to devote  his  full time,  energy  and skill  to  the
business  of  the Company  and to  the promotion  of the  best interests  of the
Company and  the performance  of his  duties as  President and  Chief  Operating
Officer  of the Company; provided that the Employee shall not (to the extent not
inconsistent with paragraphs 3(d) and 10(b) below) be prevented from (a) serving
as a director of any  corporation consented to in  advance by resolution of  the
Board  of Directors of the Company, (b) engaging in charitable, religious, civic
or other non-profit community activities,  or (c) investing his personal  assets
in  such form or manner as will not require any substantial services on his part
in the operation or affairs of the  business in which such investments are  made
which  would detract  from or  interfere or  cause a  conflict of  interest with
performance of his duties hereunder.

    (d) Employee agrees  to observe policies  and procedures of  the Company  in
effect  from  time to  time applicable  to employees  of the  Company including,
without limitation, policies  with respect  to employee  loyalty and  prohibited
conflicts of interest.
<PAGE>
    4.  COMPENSATION.  The Company shall pay to Employee, for all services to be
performed by Employee an annual base salary ("Base Salary") at the rate of Three
Hundred  Thirty-Two  Thousand Dollars  ($332,000.00)  per fiscal  year,  or such
greater amount as may be authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, in
its sole discretion upon annual review during the term of employment, payable in
periodic installments  in  accordance with  the  Company's payroll  practice  in
effect  from  time  to  time and  prorated  for  any portion  of  a  fiscal year
(Company's fiscal  year currently  being the  period from  June 1  of each  year
through May 31 of the following year).

    5.   INCENTIVE  BONUS PAYMENTS.   In addition  to the  Base Salary described
above, Employee will continue to participate in and receive payments under  such
incentive  bonus programs as the Company,  in its sole discretion, may authorize
from time to  time for  Employee and other  executive officers  of the  Company;
provided, however, Employee will be entitled to the following during the term of
this Employment Agreement:

        (a) ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY INCENTIVE BONUS OPPORTUNITY.

           Employee  will have  an annual incentive  bonus opportunity  of up to
       100% of base salary, subject to annual financial targets approved by  the
       Compensation  Committee of the Board of  Directors, and allocated 25% for
       asset management and 75% for  operating performance. Performance will  be
       measured  against annual  financial targets approved  by the Compensation
       Committee of  the  Board  of  Directors. Any  bonus  granted  under  this
       subprovision  in an amount equal  to 80% or less  of base salary shall be
       paid in cash  and the balance  shall be paid  in restricted stock  awards
       subject  to the  Company's qualified Stock  Benefit Plan  (valued at NYSE
       closing price  on date  of  grant). Thirty-three  and one  third  percent
       (33  1/3%)  of  each  such  restricted  stock  award  shall  vest  on the
       successive anniversary dates of  the respective award  over a three  year
       period based solely on the passage of time without reference to continued
       employment with the Company.

           The   cash  portion  of  the   incentive  bonus  payable  under  this
       subprovision 5(a) will be paid no  later than the 15th of July  following
       the  end of  the fiscal  year; the restricted  stock awards  shall have a
       grant date of July 15 each year.

        (b) INCENTIVE STOCK BONUS AWARDS.

           (1) RESTRICTED STOCK.

               The Company  will  grant  Employee restricted  stock  awards  (i)
           subject  to the terms  of the Company's  qualified Stock Benefit Plan
           and Employee's continued employment with  the Company on the  vesting
           date,  and  (ii)  subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  Compensation
           Committee to establish reasonable performance criteria applicable  to
           such grants on or before each award grant date, as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
     GRANT DATE         NUMBER OF SHARES
- --------------------  ---------------------
<S>                   <C>
October 1, 1994                 8,250
October 1, 1995                 9,075
October 1, 1996                 9,983
</TABLE>

           Thereafter, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will
           consider Employee for additional restricted stock awards on an ad hoc
           basis in its sole discretion.

               Twenty percent (20%) of each such restricted stock award shall be
           scheduled  to vest  on the successive  grant date  anniversary of the
           respective award over a five

                                       2
<PAGE>
           year period.  Their terms  and conditions  shall be  consistent  with
           restricted  stock  awards made  to  other executive  officers  of the
           Company or, if none are made, those most recently heretofore made  to
           Employee.

           (2) STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

               The  Company will grant Employee  stock options for 60,000 shares
           of Company Common Stock subject to  the terms of the AAR CORP.  Stock
           Benefit  Plan in fiscal  1995 at such  time as it  makes stock option
           grants to  other  key  employees  under  the  Plan.  Thereafter,  the
           Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  will consider
           Employee for additional stock option grants annually during the  term
           hereof  commensurate with  his position  and duties  as President and
           Chief Operating Officer in their sole  discretion at such time as  it
           considers  annual stock  option grants  for other  key employees. All
           such grants shall vest  20%/year over a five  year period and have  a
           life of 10 years from date of grant. Other terms and conditions shall
           be  consistent with  grants made to  other executive  officers of the
           Company at the time of grant.

    6.   VACATION  AND  FRINGE  BENEFITS.   Employee  will  accrue  vacation  in
accordance  with the  Company's policy  in effect  from time  to time  for other
executive officers; provided that  no decrease in  vacation benefits from  those
available  on the date  hereof shall be  applicable to Employee  during the term
hereof. Employee  shall be  entitled to  participate, according  to  eligibility
provisions  of each,  in such medical,  life and  disability insurance programs,
profit sharing plans, retirement plans and in other fringe benefit plans as  may
be  in effect from  time to time during  the term hereof  and available to other
executive officers of the Company.

    7.  CLUB DUES AND BUSINESS EXPENSES.  During the term hereof, Employee  will
be  entitled  to  reimbursement  for  normal  travel  and  business  expenses in
accordance with applicable  Company policy,  and will  be reimbursed  membership
dues  in the Green Acres  Country Club, the Standard  Club and such professional
clubs/organizations that are appropriate and conducive to the performance of his
duties.

    8.  PROFESSIONAL FEES.  The Company will reimburse Employee for professional
financial planning  and  income  tax preparation  assistance  expenses  actually
incurred in an amount not to exceed $5,000/year during the term hereof.

    9.  TERMINATION.

    (a) The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time for Cause. Any such
termination  will  be  by  majority  action  of  the  Board  of  Directors (with
Employee's vote disregarded) taken at a  regular or specially called meeting  of
the  Board, after a minimum 10 day  notice thereof to Employee, with termination
of this Agreement listed as an agenda item. Employee will be given a  reasonable
opportunity  to  be  heard at  such  meeting  with counsel  present  if Employee
desires.

    The term "Cause" shall be limited to  a good faith finding by resolution  of
the  Board  of  Directors setting  forth  the  particulars thereof,  of  (i) any
material breach by Employee of any statutory  or common law duty of loyalty,  or
(ii)  any material  breach of  this Agreement  which, if  curable, is  not cured
within ten (10)  days of notice  thereof to Employee.  Such resolution shall  be
final and binding upon the Employee.

    Upon termination for Cause, no further compensation or benefits shall accrue
or  be payable to Employee hereunder except for any compensation, bonus or other
benefits which  have  accrued  to  Employee  prior  to  the  date  of  any  such
termination.

    (b)  The Company may terminate this Agreement  at any time prior to a Change
in Control of the Company as  defined in Section 12(c) below for  unsatisfactory
performance by Employee of his

                                       3
<PAGE>
duties  and responsibilities hereunder (including but  not limited to failure to
meet financial goals as may be approved by the Compensation Committee), provided
that the  Company  has given  Employee  (i)  written notice  setting  forth  the
particulars  of his performance deficiencies and  (ii) six months opportunity to
correct them to  the satisfaction  of the  Company. Any  termination under  this
section  9(b) shall be by  resolution of the Board  of Directors of the Company,
which shall be  final and  binding upon Employee.  In the  event of  termination
pursuant  to this section 9(b), the Company will pay to Employee, monthly for 24
months, an  amount  (subject  to applicable  withholding)  equal  to  Employee's
regular  monthly base salary at time of termination; provided, however, all such
payment obligations shall terminate immediately  upon any breach by Employee  of
paragraph  10 of this Agreement. Upon termination pursuant to this section 9(b),
no further compensation or benefits shall accrue or be payable to Employee under
this Agreement  except for  (i) the  salary continuation  payments provided  for
above,  and (ii) any compensation bonus or  other benefits which have accrued to
Employee prior to the date of any such termination.

    (c) The Company  or the Employee  may terminate this  Agreement at any  time
because  of the  Disability of Employee.  "Disability" shall mean  a physical or
mental condition which has prevented Employee from substantially performing  his
duties  under this Agreement for  a period of 180 days  and which is expected to
continue to render Employee unable to  substantially perform his duties for  the
remaining  term of this  Agreement on a  full-time basis. The  Company will make
reasonable accommodation for  any handicap  of Employee  as may  be required  by
applicable law.

    In  the event  of termination  by the Company  for Disability,  a good faith
determination of the existence  of a Disability shall  be made by resolution  of
the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion, setting forth the
particulars  of  the  Disability  which  shall be  final  and  binding  upon the
Employee. The Company may require the submission of such medical evidence as  to
the condition of the Employee as it may deem necessary in order to arrive at its
determination  of the occurrence of a Disability. Employee will be provided with
reasonable opportunity to present additional medical evidence as to the  medical
condition   of  Employee  for  consideration  prior  to  the  Board  making  its
determination of the occurrence of a Disability.

    Upon termination of this Agreement for Disability, Employee will continue to
be eligible to participate in the  Company's medical, dental and life  insurance
programs  available  to  executive  officers  in  accordance  with  their  terms
applicable to  employees  for  a  period  of 3  years  from  the  date  of  such
termination of this Agreement.

    (d)  This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the death of Employee
during the  term.  In  such event,  death  benefits  payable under  any  of  the
Company's  benefit plans in which Employee was  a participant at the time of his
death shall be payable in accordance with the terms of such plans.

    (e) Employee may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days written notice if any
person other than Employee is selected by the Board of Directors to succeed  the
present  Chief  Executive  Officer  upon his  retirement,  resignation  or other
departure from that  office. In the  event of termination  by Employee for  such
reason,  the Company  will pay  to Employee,  monthly for  24 months,  an amount
(subject to applicable  withholding) equal  to Employee's  regular monthly  base
salary  at time of termination plus an amount equal to 1/12th of the most recent
fiscal year cash bonus paid to  Employee; provided all such payment  obligations
shall  terminate immediately upon any breach by Employee of paragraph 10 of this
Agreement. Upon  termination of  this  Agreement by  Employee pursuant  to  this
paragraph, no further compensation or benefits shall

                                       4
<PAGE>
accrue  or be payable to Employee under this Agreement except for (i) the salary
continuation payments provided for  above, and (ii)  any compensation, bonus  or
other  benefits which  have accrued to  Employee prior  to the date  of any such
termination.

    10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND RESTRICTION OF COMPETITION.

    (a) Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential  information,
secret  processes and know-how  developed and acquired by  the Company and other
subsidiaries of  the Company  (together the  "Affiliated Companies")  are  among
their  most  valuable assets  and  that the  value  of such  information  may be
destroyed by  unauthorized  disclosure.  All such  trade  secrets,  confidential
information, secret processes and know-how imparted to or learned by Employee in
the  course of  his employment  with respect to  the business  of the Affiliated
Companies (whether acquired before or after  the date hereof) will be deemed  to
be  confidential and will  not be used  or disclosed by  Employee, except to the
extent necessary to  perform his duties  and, in no  event, disclosed to  anyone
outside  the employ of the Affiliated Companies and their authorized consultants
and advisors,  unless either  such information  is or  has been  made  generally
available to the public or express written authorization to use or disclose such
information  has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be employed by
the Company for any reason,  he shall not take with  him any documents or  other
papers  containing or reflecting trade secrets, confidential information, secret
processes or know-how. Employee acknowledges that his employment hereunder  will
place  him in a  position of utmost confidence  and that he  will have access to
confidential information  concerning  the  operation  of  the  business  of  the
Affiliated  Companies,  including, but  not  limited to,  manufacturing methods,
developments, secret  processes, know-how,  costs, prices  and pricing  methods,
sources  of supply and customer names and  relations. All such information is in
the nature of a  trade secret and  is the exclusive  property of the  Affiliated
Companies  and shall be deemed confidential information for the purposes of this
paragraph.

    (b) Employee agrees that during the term hereof and for a period of two  (2)
years  after  voluntary  termination  of  employment  hereunder  by  Employee or
termination of employment hereunder by Company  pursuant to section 9 above,  he
shall  not, without the express written consent  of the Company, either alone or
as a consultant to, or partner,  employee, officer, director, or stockholder  of
any  organization,  entity  or  business,  (i)  engage  in  direct  or  indirect
competition with the Company or any  Affiliated Company within 100 miles of  any
location  within the  United States  of America or  any other  country where the
Company or any  Affiliated Company does  business from time  to time during  the
term  hereof; (ii) solicit in connection  with any activity which is competitive
with any  of  the businesses  of  the Company  or  any Affiliated  Company,  any
customers  or suppliers of the Company  or any Affiliated Company; (iii) solicit
for employment any  sales, marketing or  management employee of  Company or  any
Affiliated  Company or induce or  attempt to induce any  customer or supplier of
the Company or  any Affiliated Company  to terminate or  materially change  such
relationship.  Company  and  Employee  acknowledge  the  reasonableness  of this
covenant not to  compete and  non-solicitation and  the reasonableness  thereof,
including  but not limited to the geographic area and duration of time which are
a part hereof. This covenant not to compete may be enforced with respect to  any
geographic  area in  which the Company  or any Affiliated  Company does business
during the term hereof.  Nothing herein shall prohibit  Employee from being  the
legal  or equitable holder of not more  than 5% of the outstanding capital stock
of any publicly held corporation which may be in direct or indirect  competition
with the Company or any Affiliated Company.

    (c) If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 10 shall be deemed
invalid  or unenforceable by the  laws of the jurisdiction in  which it is to be
enforced by reason  of being vague  or unreasonable as  to duration,  geographic
scope, nature of activities restricted, or for any other

                                       5
<PAGE>
reason, this provision shall be considered divisible as to such portions and the
foregoing  restrictions shall become and be  immediately amended to include only
such duration, scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable
and enforceable by the court or  other body having jurisdiction to enforce  this
Agreement;  and the parties  hereto agree that the  restrictions, as so amended,
shall be valid and  binding as though the  invalid or unenforceable portion  had
not been involved herein.

    (d)  The  Employee  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company  would  be
irreparably harmed by violations of this Section 10 and in recognition  thereof,
the  Company shall  be entitled  to an  injunction or  other decree  of specific
performance with respect  to any violation  thereof (without any  bond or  other
security  being required)  in addition  to other  available legal  and equitable
remedies.

    (e) This Section 10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and  any
termination of Employee's employment.

    11.    CHANGES  IN BUSINESS.    The  Company, acting  through  its  Board of
Directors, will at all times have complete control over the Company's  business.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any time or
times  change or discontinue any or all of its present or future operations, may
close or move any one or more of its divisions or offices, may undertake any new
servicing or sales  operation, may  sell any  one or  more of  its divisions  or
offices to any company not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or
may  take any and all other steps which its Board of Directors, in its exclusive
judgment, shall deem desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or recourse  by
reason  of such action.  Provided, however, no  such action shall  result in the
reduction of Employee's  Base Salary  hereunder; provided, further  that if  the
Company  discontinues  operations,  a  discretionary bonus  may  or  may  not be
granted, however,  Employee  will  be  entitled  to  a  pro-rata  share  of  any
non-discretionary  incentive  bonus  through the  date  of  discontinuance. Said
pro-rata bonus will be calculated by the Chief Financial Officer of the  Company
whose determination will be final.

    12.  CHANGE IN CONTROL.

    (a)  In the event of a Change in  Control of the Company and (i) the Company
terminates this Agreement for other than  Cause or Disability, or (ii)  Employee
terminates  this  Agreement for  Good Reason  by written  notice to  the Company
setting forth the particulars thereof after having given the Company notice  and
opportunity to be heard with respect thereto,

        (1)  the Company shall promptly  pay to Employee, in  a lump sum, a cash
    payment  in  an  amount  equal  to  three  times  Employee's  average  total
    compensation  (base salary plus cash bonus) for the last two fiscal years or
    such lesser amount  as Employee  may elect  to take,  subject to  applicable
    withholding, and

        (2)  Employee shall continue to be  covered by and receive the benefits,
    in accordance with their terms, of all of the Company's medical, dental  and
    life  insurance plans, for  three years thereafter  but at no  less than the
    levels he was receiving immediately prior to the Change in Control.

        (3) Employee shall  receive an additional  retirement benefit, over  and
    above  that which Employee would normally be entitled to under the Company's
    retirement plans applicable to Employee,  equal to the actuarial  equivalent
    of  the  additional  amount  that  Employee  would  have  earned  under such
    retirement plans or programs had he accumulated three additional  continuous
    years  of service. Such amount shall be paid to the executive in a cash lump
    sum payment at his normal retirement age. Employee may also elect to receive
    such payment at

                                       6
<PAGE>
    his early retirement age,  as provided for in  the retirement plans, with  a
    corresponding  actuarial reduction in the amount  of such payment based upon
    the earlier date of such payment.

    (b) The amounts paid to the Employee under this Change in Control  provision
applicable  to Employee  shall be considered  severance pay  in consideration of
past services  Employee has  rendered to  the Company  and in  consideration  of
Employee's  continued  service  from the  date  hereof to  entitlement  to those
payments.

    (c) For purposes of this provision

         (i) "Change in Control" means the earliest of:

           (1) the  occurrence  of any  "Distribution  Date", as  such  term  is
       defined  in Section 3 of the Rights Agreement between the Company and The
       First National Bank of Chicago, dated July 21, 1987, as amended;

           (2) the effective time  of a merger or  consolidation of the  Company
       with  one or more other corporations as  a result of which the holders of
       the outstanding common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company immediately
       prior  to  such  merger  or  consolidation  (other  than  those  who  are
       affiliates of any such other corporation, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
       General  Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
       hold less than  70% of  the voting stock  of the  surviving or  resulting
       corporation or its parent;

           (3)  the effective  time of  a transfer  of substantially  all of the
       assets of the Company other than to  an entity of which the Company  owns
       at least 70% of the voting stock; or

           (4)  the election to the Board during  any 3 year period, without the
       recommendation or approval of the incumbent  Board, of the lesser of  (A)
       three directors or (B) directors constituting a majority of the number of
       directors of the Company then in office; or

           (5)  the occurrence of  any arrangement or  understanding relating to
       the Company  which would  give  rise to  a  filing requirement  with  the
       Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange
       Act Rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

        (ii) "Good Reason" means:

           (1) a material reduction in the nature or scope of Employee's duties,
       responsibilities,  authority, power  or functions  from those  enjoyed by
       Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control; or

           (2) a good faith  determination by Employee that  as the result of  a
       Change  in  Control and  a  material change  in  employment circumstances
       thereafter, he is  unable to  carry out his  duties and  responsibilities
       contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the practices,
       standards,  values or philosophy of the  Company immediately prior to the
       Change in Control; or

           (3) a material breach of this Agreement by the Company; or

           (4) a relocation of the primary  place of employment of at least  100
       miles.

    (d)  The  Company  will  pay reasonable  legal/attorney's  fees  incurred by
Employee in  connection with  enforcement of  any right  or benefit  under  this
provision.

                   SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT

    This  Severance  and  Change  in Control  Agreement  ("Agreement")  made and
entered into as of the 24th day of  February, 1995, by and between AAR CORP.,  a
Delaware corporation ("Company"), and Philip C. Slapke ("Employee").

    WHEREAS,  the Company currently  employs Employee as an  employee at will in
the capacity of Vice President-Trading Group; and

    WHEREAS, Employee  desires the  Company to  pay Employee  certain  severance
payments  upon  a  Change  in  Control of  AAR  CORP.  and  upon  termination of
employment prior to a Change in Control; and

    WHEREAS, the Company  is willing  to pay Employee  severance payments  under
certain  circumstances if  Employee agrees  to confidentiality,  non-compete and
certain other covenants.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of  the mutual agreements herein set  forth
and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

    1.  EMPLOYMENT.  Employee will continue employment with the Company as an at
will employee subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

    2.  DUTIES.  During the continuation of his employment, Employee shall:

        (a)  well and faithfully  serve the Company and  do and perform assigned
    duties and responsibilities in the ordinary course of his employment and the
    business of the Company (within such limits as the Company may from time  to
    time prescribe), professionally, faithfully and diligently.

        (b)  devote  his full  time, energy  and  skill to  the business  of the
    Company and his assigned duties  and responsibilities, and to the  promotion
    of  the best interests of the Company;  provided that Employee shall not (to
    the extent not  inconsistent with  Section 4  below) be  prevented from  (a)
    serving  as a director of any corporation consented to in advance in writing
    by the  Company,  (b) engaging  in  charitable, religious,  civic  or  other
    non-profit  community activities,  or (c)  investing his  personal assets in
    such form or manner as will not require any substantial services on his part
    in the operation or  affairs of the business  in which such investments  are
    made  or  which would  detract  from or  interfere  or cause  a  conflict of
    interest with performance of his duties hereunder.

        (c) observe all policies  and procedures of the  Company in effect  from
    time  to  time applicable  to employees  of  the Company  including, without
    limitation,  policies  with  respect  to  employee  loyalty  and  prohibited
    conflicts of interest.

    3.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

    (a)  Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential information,
secret processes  and know-how  developed  and acquired  by  AAR CORP.  and  its
affiliates or subsidiaries (together the "Affiliated Companies") are among their
most  valuable assets and that the value of such information may be destroyed by
unauthorized disclosure.  All  such  trade  secrets,  confidential  information,
secret  processes and know-how imparted to or  learned by Employee in the course
of his  employment with  respect to  the business  of the  Affiliated  Companies
(whether  acquired  before  or after  the  date  hereof) will  be  deemed  to be
confidential and will not be used or disclosed by Employee, except to the extent
necessary to perform his  duties and, in no  event, disclosed to anyone  outside
the  employ of  the Affiliated  Companies and  their authorized  consultants and
advisors, unless (i) such information is or has been made generally available to
the public,  (ii) disclosure  of such  information  is required  by law  in  the
opinion  of Employee's counsel (provided that written notice thereof is given to
Company as  soon  as  possible  but  not  less  than  24  hours  prior  to  such
disclosure),  or (iii)  express written  authorization to  use or  disclose such
<PAGE>
information has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be employed  by
the Company for any reason, he shall not take with him any electronically stored
data,  documents  or  other  papers  containing  or  reflecting  trade  secrets,
confidential information,  secret  processes,  know-how,  or  computer  software
programs.  Employee acknowledges that his employment hereunder will place him in
a position of  utmost confidence and  that he will  have access to  confidential
information   concerning  the  operation  of  the  business  of  the  Affiliated
Companies, including, but not  limited to, manufacturing methods,  developments,
secret  processes,  know-how,  computer  software  programs,  costs,  prices and
pricing methods, sources of  supply and customer names  and relations. All  such
information  is in the  nature of a trade  secret and is  the sole and exclusive
property  of  the  Affiliated  Companies   and  shall  be  deemed   confidential
information for the purposes of this paragraph.

    (b) Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that Employee may have
as  author, designer, inventor or otherwise as creator of any written or graphic
material, design, invention, improvement,  or any other  idea or thing  whatever
that  Employee may write, draw, design, conceive, perfect, or reduce to practice
during employment with the Company or within 120 days after termination of  such
employment,  whether done  during or outside  of normal work  hours, and whether
done alone or  in conjunction with  others ("Intellectual Property"),  provided,
however,  that  Employee  reserves  all rights  in  anything  done  or developed
entirely by Employee on Employee's own personal time and without the use of  any
Company  equipment, supplies, facilities or information, or the participation of
any other  Company employee,  unless it  relates to  the Company's  business  or
reasonably  anticipated business, or grows out of any work performed by Employee
for the Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual  Property
developed  by  Employee to  the Company,  and fully  cooperate at  the Company's
request and expense in  any efforts by  the Company or  its assignees to  secure
protection  for such Intellectual Property by way of domestic or foreign patent,
copyright, trademark  or  service  mark  registration  or  otherwise,  including
executing  specific assignments or  such other documents  or taking such further
action as may be considered necessary to vest title in Company or its  assignees
and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

    4.  NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

    (a)  Employee agrees  that during  his continuation  of employment  with the
Company and  for one  (1)  year thereafter  so long  as  the Company  makes  the
severance  payments to Employee  pursuant to subsections 4(b)  or 4(c) below, he
shall not, without the express written  consent of the Company, either alone  or
as  a consultant to, or partner,  employee, officer, director, or stockholder of
any organization,  entity  or  business,  (i) take  or  convert  for  Employee's
personal  gain or benefit  or for the  benefit of any  third party, any business
opportunities which may be of interest to the Company or any Affiliated  Company
which  Employee becomes aware of during the  term of his employment; (ii) engage
in direct or  indirect competition with  the Company or  any Affiliated  Company
within  100 miles  of any location  within the  United States of  America or any
other country where  the Company or  any Affiliated Company  does business  from
time  to  time during  the term  hereof;  (iii) solicit  in connection  with any
activity which is competitive with any of  the businesses of the Company or  any
Affiliated Company, any customers of the Company or any Affiliated Company; (iv)
solicit for employment any sales, marketing or management employee of Company or
any  Affiliated Company or induce or attempt  to induce any customer or supplier
of the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate or materially change  such
relationship.  Company  and  Employee  acknowledge  the  reasonableness  of  the
foregoing covenants  not  to compete  and  non-solicitation, including  but  not
limited to the geographic area and duration of time which are a part hereof, and
further, that the restrictions stated in this Section 4 are reasonably necessary
for the protection of Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant
not  to compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area in which the

                                       2
<PAGE>
Company or any Affiliated Company does business during the term hereof.  Nothing
herein  shall prohibit Employee from being the legal or equitable holder, solely
for investment purposes, of less  than 5% of the  capital stock of any  publicly
held corporation which may be in direct or indirect competition with the Company
or any Affiliated Company.

    (b)  Upon termination  of Employee's  employment by  the Company  prior to a
Change in Control (as defined in 6(b)(i) below) for any reason other than  Cause
(as  defined in  6(b)(iv) below), the  Company will pay  Employee severance each
month for 12 months  ("Severance Period"), in an  amount (subject to  applicable
withholding)  equal to 1/12 of Employee's base salary; and, further, the Company
will pay Employee a PIP bonus award in accordance with and subject to the  terms
and  conditions of Employee's PIP in a lump sum at the time any such PIP bonuses
are payable under the PIP or at  such time as the Severance Period is  complete,
whichever  is later (with interest at prime  rate plus one percentage point from
the earlier of  such dates), for  any PIP  bonuses earned (1)  in the  completed
fiscal year preceeding termination but not due and payable prior to termination,
and  (2) prorata for the period prior to termination of emloyment in any partial
PIP fiscal year based  on Employee's performance  against Employee's PIP  during
such  partial  period;  provided, however,  that  (i) all  such  monthly payment
obligations shall  terminate  immediately  upon  Employee  obtaining  full  time
employment  in a comparable position in terms of salary level, and (ii) all such
payment obligations  shall terminate  or lapse  immediately upon  any breach  by
Employee  of Section 3 or  4(a) of this Agreement  or if Employee shall commence
any action or proceeding  in any court or  before any regulatory agency  arising
out of or in connection with termination of his employment.

    (c)  If  Employee  terminates  his employment  or  Employee's  employment is
terminated by the Company  for Cause (as defined  below), the Company may  elect
(but is not required to), by written notice thereof to Employee, within five (5)
days  of any such termination of Employee's employment with the Company prior to
a Change in Control (as defined below), to pay Employee severance as provided in
and subject to the provisions of subsection 4(b) above.

    (d) Employee may terminate  this Severance and  Change in Control  Agreement
effective  immediately upon  notice thereof  in writing  to Company  at any time
while still  employed  within  a  sixty (60)  calendar  day  period  immediately
following the effective date of any reduction by Company in (i) Employee's level
of   responsibility   or  position   from  that   held   by  Employee   as  Vice
President-Trading Group  on  the  effective  date of  this  Agreement,  or  (ii)
Employee's  level  of  compensation,  including  retirement  benefits  in effect
immediately prior to any such change.

    (e) If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 4 shall be  deemed
invalid  or unenforceable by the  laws of the jurisdiction in  which it is to be
enforced by reason  of being vague  or unreasonable as  to duration,  geographic
scope,  nature of activities restricted, or for any other reason, this provision
shall be considered divisible as to such portions and the foregoing restrictions
set forth in 4(a) shall become and  be immediately amended to include only  such
duration,  scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable and
enforceable by  the court  or other  body having  jurisdiction to  enforce  this
Agreement;  and the parties  hereto agree that the  restrictions, as so amended,
shall be valid and  binding as though the  invalid or unenforceable portion  had
not been involved herein.

    (f)  The  Employee  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company  would  be
irreparably harmed by  violations of  Section 3 or  Section 4(a)  above, and  in
recognition  thereof, the  Company shall be  entitled to an  injunction or other
decree of specific performance  with respect to  any violation thereof  (without
any  bond or other security being required) in addition to other available legal
and equitable remedies.

    5.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

    (a) Upon and  after termination  of employment  howsoever arising,  Employee
shall, upon request by Company:

        (1)  immediately return  to the  Company all  correspondence, documents,
    business calendars/diaries, or other property belonging to the Company which
    is in his possession,

        (2) immediately resign from any  office Employee holds with the  Company
    or any Affiliated Company; and

        (3) cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in the resolution
    of  all  matters Employee  worked on  or was  involved in  during Employee's
    employment with the Company. Employee's cooperation will include  reasonable
    consultation  by telephone. Further, in connection therewith, Employee will,
    at  Company's  request  upon  reasonable  advance  notice  and  subject   to
    Employee's  availability,  make himself  available to  Company in  person at
    Company's premises, for testimony in court, or elsewhere; provided, however,
    that in  such  event,  Company shall  reimburse  all  Employee's  reasonable
    expenses and pay Employee a reasonable per diem or hourly stipend.

    6.  CHANGE IN CONTROL.

    (a)  In the event (i) a  Change in Control of AAR  CORP. occurs and (ii) the
Company terminates Employee's employment for other than Cause or Disability,  or
Employee  terminates Employee's employment for Good  Reason by written notice to
the Company setting forth the particulars thereof after having given the Company
notice and  opportunity to  be heard  with respect  thereto, and  (iii)  neither
incumbent in the positions of Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer
of  the Company on the effective date  hereof are Chief Executive Officer of the
Company at the time of such termination of employment,

        (1) the Company shall promptly  pay to Employee, in  a lump sum, a  cash
    payment  in  an  amount  equal  to  three  times  Employee's  average  total
    compensation (base salary plus cash bonus) for the last two fiscal years  or
    such  lesser amount  as Employee  may elect  to take,  subject to applicable
    withholding. Employee  may  agree to  take  payments  of any  amounts  on  a
    schedule  of his own choosing provided that such schedule shall be completed
    no later than three years from the occurrence of the last triggering event.

        (2) Employee shall continue to be  covered by and receive the  benefits,
    in  accordance with their terms, of all of the Company's medical, dental and
    life insurance plans,  for three years  thereafter but at  no less than  the
    levels he was receiving immediately prior to the Change in Control.

        (3)  Employee shall receive  an additional retirement  benefit, over and
    above that which Employee would normally be entitled to under the  Company's
    retirement  plans applicable to Employee,  equal to the actuarial equivalent
    of the  additional  amount  that  Employee  would  have  earned  under  such
    retirement  plans or programs had he accumulated three additional continuous
    years of service. Such amount shall be paid to the executive in a cash  lump
    sum payment at his normal retirement age. Employee may also elect to receive
    such  payment at his early retirement age, as provided for in the retirement
    plans, with  a  corresponding actuarial  reduction  in the  amount  of  such
    payment based upon the earlier date of such payment.

    (b) For purposes of this Agreement

         (i) "Change in Control" means the earliest of:

           (1)  the  occurrence  of any  "Distribution  Date", as  such  term is
       defined in Section 3 of the Rights Agreement between the Company and  The
       First National Bank of Chicago, dated July 21, 1987, as amended;

           (2)  the effective time  of a merger or  consolidation of the Company
       with one or more other corporations as  a result of which the holders  of
       the outstanding common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company immediately
       prior  to  such  merger  or  consolidation  (other  than  those  who  are
       affiliates of any such other corporation, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
       General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of  1934)
       hold  less than  70% of  the voting stock  of the  surviving or resulting
       corporation or its parent;

           (3) the effective  time of  a transfer  of substantially  all of  the
       assets  of the Company other than to  an entity of which the Company owns
       at least 70% of the voting stock; or

           (4) the election to the Board  during any 3 year period, without  the
       recommendation  or approval of the incumbent  Board, of the lesser of (A)
       three directors or (B) directors constituting a majority of the number of
       directors of the Company then in office; or

           (5) the occurrence  of any arrangement  or understanding relating  to
       the  Company  which would  give  rise to  a  filing requirement  with the
       Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange
       Act Rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

        (ii) "Good Reason" means:

           (1) a material reduction in the nature or scope of Employee's duties,
       responsibilities, authority,  power or  functions from  those enjoyed  by
       Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control occurring at any time
       during the immediate two year period after the Change in Control; or

           (2)  a good faith determination  by Employee that as  the result of a
       Change in Control and  a material change  in employment circumstances  at
       any  time  during  the immediate  two  year  period after  the  Change in
       Control,  he   is  unable   to  carry   out  his   assigned  duties   and
       responsibilities  in a  manner consistent with  the practices, standards,
       values or philosophy of  the Company immediately prior  to the Change  in
       Control; or

           (3)  a relocation of the primary place  of employment of at least 100
       miles.

        (iii) "Disability" means:

           (1) a physical or mental condition which has prevented Employee  from
       substantially  performing  his  assigned  duties  for  a  period  of  180
       consecutive days and  which is  expected to continue  to render  Employee
       unable  to  substantially perform  his duties  on  a full-time  basis and
       otherwise meets  the benefit  eligibility requirements  of the  Company's
       Long  Term  Disability  Welfare  Benefit  Plan.  The  Company  will  make
       reasonable accommodation for any handicap of Employee as may be  required
       by applicable law.

           In  the event  of termination by  the Company for  Disability after a
       Change in  Control, a  good faith  determination of  the existence  of  a
       Disability  shall be made by resolution  of the Compensation Committee of
       the Board of Directors of the Company, in

                                       5
<PAGE>
       its sole  discretion, setting  forth the  particulars of  the  Disability
       which  shall  be final  and binding  upon the  Employee. The  Company may
       require the submission of  such medical evidence as  to the condition  of
       the  Employee  as  it  may  deem necessary  in  order  to  arrive  at its
       determination of  the  occurrence  of a  Disability,  and  Employee  will
       cooperate  in providing any  such information. Employee  will be provided
       with reasonable opportunity to present additional medical evidence as  to
       the  medical condition of  Employee for consideration  prior to the Board
       making its determination of the occurrence of a Disability.

           Upon termination  of Employment  by Company  for Disability  after  a
       Change  in Control, Employee will receive Disability payments pursuant to
       the Company's short and long  term Disability welfare benefit plans  then
       in  effect  according to  the  terms of  such  plans and  continue  to be
       eligible to  participate  in  the  Company's  medical,  dental  and  life
       insurance  programs  then  in effect  and  available to  officers  of the
       Company in accordance with their terms for  a period of 3 years from  the
       date of such termination of this Agreement.

        (iv) "Cause" means:

           (1)  any material breach  by Employee of any  statutory or common law
       duty of loyalty, or

           (2) any material breach of this  Agreement which, if curable, is  not
       cured  within  ten (10)  days of  notice  thereof to  Employee; provided,
       however,  termination  of   employment  for  unsatisfactory   performance
       (including   failure  to  meet  financial  goals)  shall  not  constitute
       termination for Cause.

           Termination for Cause  shall be limited  to a good  faith finding  by
       resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AAR
       CORP.  setting forth  the particulars thereof.  Any such  action shall be
       taken at  a  regular or  specially  called meeting  of  the  Compensation
       Committee  of  the  Board, after  a  minimum  10 days  notice  thereof to
       Employee, with termination of Employee's employment with the Company  for
       Cause  listed  as an  agenda item.  Employee will  be given  a reasonable
       opportunity to be heard at such meeting with counsel present if  Employee
       desires. Any such resolution shall be final and binding.

           Upon  termination  of employment  by  Company for  Cause,  no further
       compensation or  benefits  shall accrue  or  be payable  to  Employee  by
       Company  except for any compensation, bonus  or other benefits which have
       accrued to Employee prior to the date of any such termination.

           Nothing herein  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  the  Company  from
       terminating  Employee's employment at  any time for any  reason or for no
       reason.

    (c) The  Company  will  pay reasonable  legal/attorney's  fees  incurred  by
Employee  in  connection with  enforcement of  any right  or benefit  under this
Section 6.

    7.   CHANGES  IN  BUSINESS.    The Company,  acting  through  its  Board  of
Directors,  will at all times have  complete control over the Company's business
and retirement and other  employee health and  welfare benefit plans  ("Plans").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any time or
times  change or discontinue any  or all of its  present or future operations or
Plans (subject  to their  terms), may  close  or move  any one  or more  of  its
divisions  or offices, may  undertake any new servicing  or sales operation, may
sell any one or more of its divisions or offices to any company not  controlled,

                                       6

benefits  shall  accrue  or  be payable  to  Employee  upon or  as  a  result of
termination of Employee's employment  for any reason  whatsoever except for  any
compensation,  bonus or  other benefits which  accrued to Employee  prior to the
date of employment termination.

    The amounts paid to  the Employee under  Section 4 and  6 of this  Agreement
shall be considered severance pay in consideration of past services Employee has
rendered  to the  Company and in  consideration of  Employee's continued service
from the date hereof to entitlement to those payments.

                   SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT

    This  Severance  and  Change  in Control  Agreement  ("Agreement")  made and
entered into as of the 24th day of  February, 1995, by and between AAR CORP.,  a
Delaware corporation ("Company"), and Howard A. Pulsifer ("Employee").

    WHEREAS,  the Company currently  employs Employee as an  employee at will in
the capacity of Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and

    WHEREAS, Employee  desires the  Company to  pay Employee  certain  severance
payments  upon  a  Change  in  Control of  AAR  CORP.  and  upon  termination of
employment prior to a Change in Control; and

    WHEREAS, the Company  is willing  to pay Employee  severance payments  under
certain  circumstances if  Employee agrees  to confidentiality,  non-compete and
certain other covenants.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of  the mutual agreements herein set  forth
and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

    1.  EMPLOYMENT.  Employee will continue employment with the Company as an at
will employee subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

    2.  DUTIES.  During the continuation of his employment, Employee shall:

        (a)  well and faithfully  serve the Company and  do and perform assigned
    duties and responsibilities in the ordinary course of his employment and the
    business of the Company (within such limits as the Company may from time  to
    time prescribe), professionally, faithfully and diligently.

        (b)  devote  his full  time, energy  and  skill to  the business  of the
    Company and his assigned duties  and responsibilities, and to the  promotion
    of  the best interests of the Company;  provided that Employee shall not (to
    the extent not  inconsistent with  Section 4  below) be  prevented from  (a)
    serving  as a director of any corporation consented to in advance in writing
    by the  Company,  (b) engaging  in  charitable, religious,  civic  or  other
    non-profit  community activities,  or (c)  investing his  personal assets in
    such form or manner as will not require any substantial services on his part
    in the operation or  affairs of the business  in which such investments  are
    made  or  which would  detract  from or  interfere  or cause  a  conflict of
    interest with performance of his duties hereunder.

        (c) observe all policies  and procedures of the  Company in effect  from
    time  to  time applicable  to employees  of  the Company  including, without
    limitation,  policies  with  respect  to  employee  loyalty  and  prohibited
    conflicts of interest.

    3.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

    (a)  Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential information,
secret processes  and know-how  developed  and acquired  by  AAR CORP.  and  its
affiliates or subsidiaries (together the "Affiliated Companies") are among their
most  valuable assets and that the value of such information may be destroyed by
unauthorized disclosure.  All  such  trade  secrets,  confidential  information,
secret  processes and know-how imparted to or  learned by Employee in the course
of his  employment with  respect to  the business  of the  Affiliated  Companies
(whether  acquired  before  or after  the  date  hereof) will  be  deemed  to be
confidential and will not be used or disclosed by Employee, except to the extent
necessary to perform his  duties and, in no  event, disclosed to anyone  outside
the  employ of  the Affiliated  Companies and  their authorized  consultants and
advisors, unless (i) such information is or has been made generally available to
the public,  (ii) disclosure  of such  information  is required  by law  in  the
opinion  of Employee's counsel (provided that written notice thereof is given to
Company as  soon  as  possible  but  not  less  than  24  hours  prior  to  such
disclosure),  or (iii)  express written  authorization to  use or  disclose such
<PAGE>
information has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be employed  by
the Company for any reason, he shall not take with him any electronically stored
data,  documents  or  other  papers  containing  or  reflecting  trade  secrets,
confidential information,  secret  processes,  know-how,  or  computer  software
programs.  Employee acknowledges that his employment hereunder will place him in
a position of  utmost confidence and  that he will  have access to  confidential
information   concerning  the  operation  of  the  business  of  the  Affiliated
Companies, including, but not  limited to, manufacturing methods,  developments,
secret  processes,  know-how,  computer  software  programs,  costs,  prices and
pricing methods, sources of  supply and customer names  and relations. All  such
information  is in the  nature of a trade  secret and is  the sole and exclusive
property  of  the  Affiliated  Companies   and  shall  be  deemed   confidential
information for the purposes of this paragraph.

    (b) Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that Employee may have
as  author, designer, inventor or otherwise as creator of any written or graphic
material, design, invention, improvement,  or any other  idea or thing  whatever
that  Employee may write, draw, design, conceive, perfect, or reduce to practice
during employment with the Company or within 120 days after termination of  such
employment,  whether done  during or outside  of normal work  hours, and whether
done alone or  in conjunction with  others ("Intellectual Property"),  provided,
however,  that  Employee  reserves  all rights  in  anything  done  or developed
entirely by Employee on Employee's own personal time and without the use of  any
Company  equipment, supplies, facilities or information, or the participation of
any other  Company employee,  unless it  relates to  the Company's  business  or
reasonably  anticipated business, or grows out of any work performed by Employee
for the Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual  Property
developed  by  Employee to  the Company,  and fully  cooperate at  the Company's
request and expense in  any efforts by  the Company or  its assignees to  secure
protection  for such Intellectual Property by way of domestic or foreign patent,
copyright, trademark  or  service  mark  registration  or  otherwise,  including
executing  specific assignments or  such other documents  or taking such further
action as may be considered necessary to vest title in Company or its  assignees
and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

    4.  NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

    (a)  Employee agrees  that during  his continuation  of employment  with the
Company and for one (1) year thereafter  so long as the Company makes  severance
payments  to Employee pursuant to subsections 4(b)  or 4(c) below, he shall not,
without the  express  written consent  of  the Company,  either  alone or  as  a
consultant  to, or partner,  employee, officer, director,  or stockholder of any
organization, entity or business,  (i) take or  convert for Employee's  personal
gain   or  benefit  or  for  the  benefit  of  any  third  party,  any  business
opportunities which may be of interest to the Company or any Affiliated  Company
which  Employee becomes aware of during the  term of his employment; (ii) engage
in direct or  indirect competition with  the Company or  any Affiliated  Company
within  100 miles  of any location  within the  United States of  America or any
other country where  the Company or  any Affiliated Company  does business  from
time  to  time during  the term  hereof;  (iii) solicit  in connection  with any
activity which is competitive with any of  the businesses of the Company or  any
Affiliated Company, any customers of the Company or any Affiliated Company; (iv)
solicit for employment any sales, marketing or management employee of Company or
any  Affiliated Company or induce or attempt  to induce any customer or supplier
of the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate or materially change  such
relationship.  Company  and  Employee  acknowledge  the  reasonableness  of  the
foregoing covenants  not  to compete  and  non-solicitation, including  but  not
limited to the geographic area and duration of time which are a part hereof, and
further, that the restrictions stated in this Section 4 are reasonably necessary
for the protection of Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant
not  to compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area in which the

                                       2
<PAGE>
Company or any Affiliated Company does business during the term hereof.  Nothing
herein  shall prohibit Employee from being the legal or equitable holder, solely
for investment purposes, of less  than 5% of the  capital stock of any  publicly
held corporation which may be in direct or indirect competition with the Company
or any Affiliated Company.

    (b) The Company will pay Employee, upon termination of Employee's employment
by  the Company prior to  a Change in Control (as  defined in 6(b)(i) below) for
any reason other than Cause (as defined in 6(b)(iv) below), severance each month
for 12 months, in an amount (subject to applicable withholding) equal to 1/12 of
Employee's base salary; and, further, if the Company pays discretionary  bonuses
to  its  officers  for  the  fiscal  year  in  which  Employee's  employment  is
terminated, Employee will be  paid a bonus in  a lump sum at  the time any  such
bonuses  are paid to other  officers or at such time  as the Severance Period is
complete, whichever is later  (with interest at prime  rate plus one  percentage
point  from  the earlier  of  such dates),  (1)  for the  completed  fiscal year
preceding termination if such bonus has not been paid prior to termination,  and
(2)  for the  fiscal year  in which  employment is  terminated, prorata  for the
period prior to termination of employment based on Employee's performance during
such period; provided, however,  that (i) all  such monthly payment  obligations
shall  terminate immediately upon  Employee obtaining full  time employment in a
comparable position  in  terms  of  salary level,  and  (ii)  all  such  payment
obligations  shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any breach by Employee of
Section 3 or 4(a) of this Agreement or if Employee shall commence any action  or
proceeding  in any court  or before any  regulatory agency arising  out of or in
connection with termination of his employment.

    (c) If  Employee  terminates  his employment  or  Employee's  employment  is
terminated  by the Company for  Cause (as defined below),  the Company may elect
(but is not required to), by written notice thereof to Employee, within five (5)
days of any such termination of Employee's employment with the Company prior  to
a Change in Control (as defined below), to pay Employee severance as provided in
and subject to the provisions of subsection 4(b) above.

    (d)  Employee may terminate  this Severance and  Change in Control Agreement
effective immediately upon  notice thereof  in writing  to Company  at any  time
while  still  employed  within  a sixty  (60)  calendar  day  period immediately
following the effective date of any reduction by Company in (i) Employee's level
of responsibility or  position from  that held  by Employee  as Vice  President,
General  Counsel and Secretary on the effective  date of this Agreement, or (ii)
Employee's level  of  compensation,  including  retirement  benefits  in  effect
immediately prior to any such change.

    (e)  If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 4 shall be deemed
invalid or unenforceable by the  laws of the jurisdiction in  which it is to  be
enforced  by reason  of being vague  or unreasonable as  to duration, geographic
scope, nature of activities restricted, or for any other reason, this  provision
shall be considered divisible as to such portions and the foregoing restrictions
set  forth in 4(a) shall become and  be immediately amended to include only such
duration, scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable  and
enforceable  by  the court  or other  body having  jurisdiction to  enforce this
Agreement; and the parties  hereto agree that the  restrictions, as so  amended,
shall  be valid and binding  as though the invalid  or unenforceable portion had
not been involved herein.

    (f)  The  Employee  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company  would  be
irreparably  harmed by  violations of  Section 3 or  Section 4(a)  above, and in
recognition thereof, the  Company shall be  entitled to an  injunction or  other
decree  of specific performance  with respect to  any violation thereof (without
any bond or other security being required) in addition to other available  legal
and equitable remedies.

                                       3
<PAGE>
    5.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

    (a)  Upon and  after termination  of employment  howsoever arising, Employee
shall, upon request by Company:

        (1) immediately  return to  the Company  all correspondence,  documents,
    business calendars/diaries, or other property belonging to the Company which
    is in his possession,

        (2)  immediately resign from any office  Employee holds with the Company
    or any Affiliated Company; and

        (3) cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in the resolution
    of all  matters Employee  worked on  or was  involved in  during  Employee's
    employment  with the Company. Employee's cooperation will include reasonable
    consultation by telephone. Further, in connection therewith, Employee  will,
    at   Company's  request  upon  reasonable  advance  notice  and  subject  to
    Employee's availability,  make himself  available to  Company in  person  at
    Company's premises, for testimony in court, or elsewhere; provided, however,
    that  in  such  event,  Company shall  reimburse  all  Employee's reasonable
    expenses and pay Employee a reasonable per diem or hourly stipend.

    6.  CHANGE IN CONTROL.

    (a) In the event (i)  a Change in Control of  AAR CORP. occurs and (ii)  the
Company  terminates Employee's employment for other than Cause or Disability, or
Employee terminates Employee's employment for  Good Reason by written notice  to
the Company setting forth the particulars thereof after having given the Company
notice  and  opportunity to  be heard  with respect  thereto, and  (iii) neither
incumbent in the positions of Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer
of the Company on the effective date  hereof are Chief Executive Officer of  the
Company at the time of such termination of employment,

        (1)  the Company shall promptly  pay to Employee, in  a lump sum, a cash
    payment  in  an  amount  equal  to  three  times  Employee's  average  total
    compensation  (base salary plus cash bonus) for the last two fiscal years or
    such lesser amount  as Employee  may elect  to take,  subject to  applicable
    withholding.  Employee  may  agree to  take  payments  of any  amounts  on a
    schedule of his own choosing provided that such schedule shall be  completed
    no later than three years from the occurrence of the last triggering event.

        (2)  Employee shall continue to be  covered by and receive the benefits,
    in accordance with their terms, of all of the Company's medical, dental  and
    life  insurance plans, for  three years thereafter  but at no  less than the
    levels he was receiving immediately prior to the Change in Control.

        (3) Employee shall  receive an additional  retirement benefit, over  and
    above  that which Employee would normally be entitled to under the Company's
    retirement plans applicable to Employee,  equal to the actuarial  equivalent
    of  the  additional  amount  that  Employee  would  have  earned  under such
    retirement plans or programs had he accumulated three additional  continuous
    years  of service. Such amount shall be paid to the executive in a cash lump
    sum payment at his normal retirement age. Employee may also elect to receive
    such payment at his early retirement age, as provided for in the  retirement
    plans,  with  a  corresponding actuarial  reduction  in the  amount  of such
    payment based upon the earlier date of such payment.

       responsibilities,  authority, power  or functions  from those  enjoyed by
       Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control occurring at any time
       during the immediate two year period after the Change in Control; or

           (2) a good faith  determination by Employee that  as the result of  a
       Change  in Control and  a material change  in employment circumstances at
       any time  during  the immediate  two  year  period after  the  Change  in
       Control,   he  is   unable  to   carry  out   his  assigned   duties  and
       responsibilities in a  manner consistent with  the practices,  standards,
       values  or philosophy of  the Company immediately prior  to the Change in
       Control; or

           (3) a relocation of the primary  place of employment of at least  100
       miles.

        (iii) "Disability" means:

           (1)  a physical or mental condition which has prevented Employee from
       substantially  performing  his  assigned  duties  for  a  period  of  180
       consecutive  days and  which is expected  to continue  to render Employee
       unable to  substantially perform  his  duties on  a full-time  basis  and
       otherwise  meets the  benefit eligibility  requirements of  the Company's
       Long  Term  Disability  Welfare  Benefit  Plan.  The  Company  will  make
       reasonable  accommodation for any handicap of Employee as may be required
       by applicable law.

           In the event  of termination by  the Company for  Disability after  a
       Change  in  Control, a  good faith  determination of  the existence  of a
       Disability shall be made by  resolution of the Compensation Committee  of
       the Board of Directors of the Company, in

                                       5
<PAGE>
       its  sole  discretion, setting  forth the  particulars of  the Disability
       which shall  be final  and binding  upon the  Employee. The  Company  may
       require  the submission of  such medical evidence as  to the condition of
       the Employee  as  it  may  deem  necessary in  order  to  arrive  at  its
       determination  of  the  occurrence  of a  Disability,  and  Employee will
       cooperate in providing  any such information.  Employee will be  provided
       with  reasonable opportunity to present additional medical evidence as to
       the medical condition of  Employee for consideration  prior to the  Board
       making its determination of the occurrence of a Disability.

           Upon  termination  of Employment  by Company  for Disability  after a
       Change in Control, Employee will receive Disability payments pursuant  to
       the  Company's short and long term  Disability welfare benefit plans then
       in effect  according  to the  terms  of such  plans  and continue  to  be
       eligible  to  participate  in  the  Company's  medical,  dental  and life
       insurance programs  then  in effect  and  available to  officers  of  the
       Company  in accordance with their terms for  a period of 3 years from the
       date of such termination of this Agreement.

        (iv) "Cause" means:

           (1) any material breach  by Employee of any  statutory or common  law
       duty of loyalty, or

           (2)  any material breach of this  Agreement which, if curable, is not
       cured within  ten (10)  days  of notice  thereof to  Employee;  provided,
       however,   termination  of  employment   for  unsatisfactory  performance
       (including  failure  to  meet  financial  goals)  shall  not   constitute
       termination for Cause.

           Termination  for Cause  shall be limited  to a good  faith finding by
       resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AAR
       CORP. setting forth  the particulars  thereof. Any such  action shall  be
       taken  at  a  regular or  specially  called meeting  of  the Compensation
       Committee of  the  Board, after  a  minimum  10 days  notice  thereof  to
       Employee,  with termination of Employee's employment with the Company for
       Cause listed  as an  agenda item.  Employee will  be given  a  reasonable
       opportunity  to be heard at such meeting with counsel present if Employee
       desires. Any such resolution shall be final and binding.

           Upon termination  of  employment by  Company  for Cause,  no  further
       compensation  or  benefits  shall accrue  or  be payable  to  Employee by
       Company except for any compensation,  bonus or other benefits which  have
       accrued to Employee prior to the date of any such termination.

           Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  the  Company from
       terminating Employee's employment at  any time for any  reason or for  no
       reason.

    (c)  The  Company  will  pay reasonable  legal/attorney's  fees  incurred by
Employee in  connection with  enforcement of  any right  or benefit  under  this
Section 6.

    7.    CHANGES  IN  BUSINESS.   The  Company,  acting  through  its  Board of
Directors, will at all times have  complete control over the Company's  business
and  retirement and other  employee health and  welfare benefit plans ("Plans").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any time or
times change or discontinue any  or all of its  present or future operations  or
Plans  (subject  to their  terms), may  close or  move  any one  or more  of its
divisions or offices, may  undertake any new servicing  or sales operation,  may
sell  any one or more of its divisions or offices to any company not controlled,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or may take any and all other steps which
its   Board   of   Directors,   in   its   exclusive   judgment,   shall    deem

                                       6
<PAGE>
desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or recourse against the Company, its
officers, directors or employees by reason of such action except for enforcement
of the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement.

    8.   SEVERANCE PAYMENT AS SOLE OBLIGATION.   Except as expressly provided in
Sections 4  and  6 above,  no  further compensation,  payments,  liabilities  or
benefits  shall  accrue  or  be payable  to  Employee  upon or  as  a  result of
termination of Employee's employment  for any reason  whatsoever except for  any
compensation,  bonus or  other benefits which  accrued to Employee  prior to the
date of employment termination.

    The amounts paid to  the Employee under  Section 4 and  6 of this  Agreement
shall be considered severance pay in consideration of past services Employee has
rendered  to the  Company and in  consideration of  Employee's continued service
from the date hereof to entitlement to those payments.

    9.  NOTICES.  Any notice or other instrument or thing required or  permitted
to be given, served or delivered to any of the parties hereto shall be delivered

                   SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT

    This  Severance  and  Change  in Control  Agreement  ("Agreement")  made and
entered into as of the 24th day of  February, 1995, by and between AAR CORP.,  a
Delaware corporation ("Company"), and Timothy J. Romenesko ("Employee").

    WHEREAS,  the Company currently  employs Employee as an  employee at will in
the  capacity  of  Vice   President-Controller,  Chief  Financial  Officer   and
Treasurer; and

    WHEREAS,  Employee  desires the  Company to  pay Employee  certain severance
payments upon  a  Change  in  Control  of AAR  CORP.  and  upon  termination  of
employment prior to a Change in Control; and

    WHEREAS,  the Company  is willing to  pay Employee  severance payments under
certain circumstances  if Employee  agrees to  confidentiality, non-compete  and
certain other covenants.

    NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the  mutual agreements herein set forth
and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

    1.  EMPLOYMENT.  Employee will continue employment with the Company as an at
will employee subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

    2.  DUTIES.  During the continuation of his employment, Employee shall:

        (a) well and faithfully  serve the Company and  do and perform  assigned
    duties and responsibilities in the ordinary course of his employment and the
    business  of the Company (within such limits as the Company may from time to
    time prescribe), professionally, faithfully and diligently.

        (b) devote  his full  time, energy  and  skill to  the business  of  the
    Company  and his assigned duties and  responsibilities, and to the promotion
    of the best interests of the  Company; provided that Employee shall not  (to
    the  extent not  inconsistent with  Section 4  below) be  prevented from (a)
    serving as a director of any corporation consented to in advance in  writing
    by  the  Company,  (b) engaging  in  charitable, religious,  civic  or other
    non-profit community activities,  or (c)  investing his  personal assets  in
    such form or manner as will not require any substantial services on his part
    in  the operation or affairs  of the business in  which such investments are
    made or  which  would detract  from  or interfere  or  cause a  conflict  of
    interest with performance of his duties hereunder.

        (c)  observe all policies  and procedures of the  Company in effect from
    time to  time applicable  to  employees of  the Company  including,  without
    limitation,  policies  with  respect  to  employee  loyalty  and  prohibited
    conflicts of interest.

    3.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

    (a) Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential  information,
secret  processes  and know-how  developed  and acquired  by  AAR CORP.  and its
affiliates or subsidiaries (together the "Affiliated Companies") are among their
most valuable assets and that the value of such information may be destroyed  by
unauthorized  disclosure.  All  such  trade  secrets,  confidential information,
secret processes and know-how imparted to  or learned by Employee in the  course
of  his  employment with  respect to  the business  of the  Affiliated Companies
(whether acquired  before  or  after the  date  hereof)  will be  deemed  to  be
confidential and will not be used or disclosed by Employee, except to the extent
necessary  to perform his duties  and, in no event,  disclosed to anyone outside
the employ  of the  Affiliated Companies  and their  authorized consultants  and
advisors, unless (i) such information is or has been made generally available to
the  public,  (ii) disclosure  of such  information  is required  by law  in the
opinion of Employee's counsel (provided that written notice thereof is given  to
Company  as  soon  as  possible  but  not  less  than  24  hours  prior  to such
disclosure), or  (iii) express  written authorization  to use  or disclose  such
<PAGE>
information  has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be employed by
the Company for any reason, he shall not take with him any electronically stored
data,  documents  or  other  papers  containing  or  reflecting  trade  secrets,
confidential  information,  secret  processes,  know-how,  or  computer software
programs. Employee acknowledges that his employment hereunder will place him  in
a  position of utmost  confidence and that  he will have  access to confidential
information  concerning  the  operation  of  the  business  of  the   Affiliated
Companies,  including, but not limited  to, manufacturing methods, developments,
secret processes,  know-how,  computer  software  programs,  costs,  prices  and
pricing  methods, sources of  supply and customer names  and relations. All such
information is in the  nature of a  trade secret and is  the sole and  exclusive
property   of  the  Affiliated  Companies   and  shall  be  deemed  confidential
information for the purposes of this paragraph.

    (b) Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that Employee may have
as author, designer, inventor or otherwise as creator of any written or  graphic
material,  design, invention, improvement,  or any other  idea or thing whatever
that Employee may write, draw, design, conceive, perfect, or reduce to  practice
during  employment with the Company or within 120 days after termination of such
employment, whether done  during or outside  of normal work  hours, and  whether
done  alone or in  conjunction with others  ("Intellectual Property"), provided,
however, that  Employee  reserves  all  rights in  anything  done  or  developed
entirely  by Employee on Employee's own personal time and without the use of any
Company equipment, supplies, facilities or information, or the participation  of
any  other  Company employee,  unless it  relates to  the Company's  business or
reasonably anticipated business, or grows out of any work performed by  Employee
for  the Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual Property
developed by  Employee to  the Company,  and fully  cooperate at  the  Company's
request  and expense in  any efforts by  the Company or  its assignees to secure
protection for such Intellectual Property by way of domestic or foreign  patent,
copyright,  trademark  or  service  mark  registration  or  otherwise, including
executing specific assignments or  such other documents  or taking such  further
action  as may be considered necessary to vest title in Company or its assignees
and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

    4.  NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

    (a) Employee  agrees that  during his  continuation of  employment with  the
Company  and for one (1) year thereafter  so long as the Company makes severance
payments to Employee pursuant to subsections  4(b) or 4(c) below, he shall  not,
without  the  express written  consent  of the  Company,  either alone  or  as a
consultant to, or partner,  employee, officer, director,  or stockholder of  any
organization,  entity or business,  (i) take or  convert for Employee's personal
gain  or  benefit  or  for  the  benefit  of  any  third  party,  any   business
opportunities  which may be of interest to the Company or any Affiliated Company
which Employee becomes aware of during  the term of his employment; (ii)  engage
in  direct or  indirect competition with  the Company or  any Affiliated Company
within 100 miles  of any location  within the  United States of  America or  any
other  country where  the Company or  any Affiliated Company  does business from
time to  time during  the term  hereof;  (iii) solicit  in connection  with  any
activity  which is competitive with any of  the businesses of the Company or any
Affiliated Company, any customers of the Company or any Affiliated Company; (iv)
solicit for employment any sales, marketing or management employee of Company or
any Affiliated Company or induce or  attempt to induce any customer or  supplier
of  the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate or materially change such
relationship.  Company  and  Employee  acknowledge  the  reasonableness  of  the
foregoing  covenants  not to  compete  and non-solicitation,  including  but not
limited to the geographic area and duration of time which are a part hereof, and
further, that the restrictions stated in this Section 4 are reasonably necessary
for the protection of Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant
not to compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area in which  the

                                       2
<PAGE>
Company  or any Affiliated Company does business during the term hereof. Nothing
herein shall prohibit Employee from being the legal or equitable holder,  solely
for  investment purposes, of less  than 5% of the  capital stock of any publicly
held corporation which may be in direct or indirect competition with the Company
or any Affiliated Company.

    (b) The Company will pay Employee, upon termination of Employee's employment
by the Company prior to  a Change in Control (as  defined in 6(b)(i) below)  for
any reason other than Cause (as defined in 6(b)(iv) below), severance each month
for 12 months, in an amount (subject to applicable withholding) equal to 1/12 of
Employee's  base salary; and, further, if the Company pays discretionary bonuses
to  its  officers  for  the  fiscal  year  in  which  Employee's  employment  is
terminated,  Employee will be  paid a bonus in  a lump sum at  the time any such
bonuses are paid to other  officers or at such time  as the Severance Period  is
complete,  whichever is later  (with interest at prime  rate plus one percentage
point from  the  earlier of  such  dates), (1)  for  the completed  fiscal  year
preceding  termination if such bonus has not been paid prior to termination, and
(2) for  the fiscal  year in  which employment  is terminated,  prorata for  the
period prior to termination of employment based on Employee's performance during
such  period; provided, however,  that (i) all  such monthly payment obligations
shall terminate immediately upon  Employee obtaining full  time employment in  a
comparable  position  in  terms  of  salary level,  and  (ii)  all  such payment
obligations shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any breach by Employee  of
Section  3 or 4(a) of this Agreement or if Employee shall commence any action or
proceeding in any court  or before any  regulatory agency arising  out of or  in
connection with termination of his employment.

    (c)  If  Employee  terminates  his employment  or  Employee's  employment is
terminated by the Company  for Cause (as defined  below), the Company may  elect
(but is not required to), by written notice thereof to Employee, within five (5)
days  of any such termination of Employee's employment with the Company prior to
a Change in Control (as defined below), to pay Employee severance as provided in
and subject to the provisions of subsection 4(b) above.

    (d) Employee may terminate  this Severance and  Change in Control  Agreement
effective  immediately upon  notice thereof  in writing  to Company  at any time
while still  employed  within  a  sixty (60)  calendar  day  period  immediately
following the effective date of any reduction by Company in (i) Employee's level
of   responsibility   or  position   from  that   held   by  Employee   as  Vice
President-Controller, Chief  Financial Officer  and Treasurer  on the  effective
date  of this  Agreement, or  (ii) Employee's  level of  compensation, including
retirement benefits in effect immediately prior to any such change.

    (e) If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 4 shall be  deemed
invalid  or unenforceable by the  laws of the jurisdiction in  which it is to be
enforced by reason  of being vague  or unreasonable as  to duration,  geographic
scope,  nature of activities restricted, or for any other reason, this provision
shall be considered divisible as to such portions and the foregoing restrictions
set forth in 4(a) shall become and  be immediately amended to include only  such
duration,  scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable and
enforceable by  the court  or other  body having  jurisdiction to  enforce  this
Agreement;  and the parties  hereto agree that the  restrictions, as so amended,
shall be valid and  binding as though the  invalid or unenforceable portion  had
not been involved herein.

    (f)  The  Employee  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company  would  be
irreparably harmed by  violations of  Section 3 or  Section 4(a)  above, and  in
recognition  thereof, the  Company shall be  entitled to an  injunction or other
decree of specific performance  with respect to  any violation thereof  (without
any  bond or other security being required) in addition to other available legal
and equitable remedies.

    5.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

    (a) Upon and  after termination  of employment  howsoever arising,  Employee
shall, upon request by Company:

        (1)  immediately return  to the  Company all  correspondence, documents,
    business calendars/diaries, or other property belonging to the Company which
    is in his possession,

        (2) immediately resign from any  office Employee holds with the  Company
    or any Affiliated Company; and

        (3) cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in the resolution
    of  all  matters Employee  worked on  or was  involved in  during Employee's
    employment with the Company. Employee's cooperation will include  reasonable
    consultation  by telephone. Further, in connection therewith, Employee will,
    at  Company's  request  upon  reasonable  advance  notice  and  subject   to
    Employee's  availability,  make himself  available to  Company in  person at
    Company's premises, for testimony in court, or elsewhere; provided, however,
    that in  such  event,  Company shall  reimburse  all  Employee's  reasonable
    expenses and pay Employee a reasonable per diem or hourly stipend.

    6.  CHANGE IN CONTROL.

    (a)  In the event (i) a  Change in Control of AAR  CORP. occurs and (ii) the
Company terminates Employee's employment for other than Cause or Disability,  or
Employee  terminates Employee's employment for Good  Reason by written notice to
the Company setting forth the particulars thereof after having given the Company
notice and  opportunity to  be heard  with respect  thereto, and  (iii)  neither
incumbent in the positions of Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer
of  the Company on the effective date  hereof are Chief Executive Officer of the
Company at the time of such termination of employment,

        (1) the Company shall promptly  pay to Employee, in  a lump sum, a  cash
    payment  in  an  amount  equal  to  three  times  Employee's  average  total
    compensation (base salary plus cash bonus) for the last two fiscal years  or
    such  lesser amount  as Employee  may elect  to take,  subject to applicable
    withholding. Employee  may  agree to  take  payments  of any  amounts  on  a
    schedule  of his own choosing provided that such schedule shall be completed
    no later than three years from the occurrence of the last triggering event.

        (2) Employee shall continue to be  covered by and receive the  benefits,
    in  accordance with their terms, of all of the Company's medical, dental and
    life insurance plans,  for three years  thereafter but at  no less than  the
    levels he was receiving immediately prior to the Change in Control.

        (3)  Employee shall receive  an additional retirement  benefit, over and
    above that which Employee would normally be entitled to under the  Company's
    retirement  plans applicable to Employee,  equal to the actuarial equivalent
    of the  additional  amount  that  Employee  would  have  earned  under  such
    retirement  plans or programs had he accumulated three additional continuous
    years of service. Such amount shall be paid to the executive in a cash  lump
    sum payment at his normal retirement age. Employee may also elect to receive
    such  payment at his early retirement age, as provided for in the retirement
    plans, with  a  corresponding actuarial  reduction  in the  amount  of  such
    payment based upon the earlier date of such payment.

    (b) For purposes of this Agreement

         (i) "Change in Control" means the earliest of:

           (1)  the  occurrence  of any  "Distribution  Date", as  such  term is
       defined in Section 3 of the Rights Agreement between the Company and  The
       First National Bank of Chicago, dated July 21, 1987, as amended;

           (2)  the effective time  of a merger or  consolidation of the Company
       with one or more other corporations as  a result of which the holders  of
       the outstanding common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company immediately
       prior  to  such  merger  or  consolidation  (other  than  those  who  are
       affiliates of any such other corporation, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
       General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of  1934)
       hold  less than  70% of  the voting stock  of the  surviving or resulting
       corporation or its parent;

           (3) the effective  time of  a transfer  of substantially  all of  the
       assets  of the Company other than to  an entity of which the Company owns
       at least 70% of the voting stock; or

           (4) the election to the Board  during any 3 year period, without  the
       recommendation  or approval of the incumbent  Board, of the lesser of (A)
       three directors or (B) directors constituting a majority of the number of
       directors of the Company then in office; or

           (5) the occurrence  of any arrangement  or understanding relating  to
       the  Company  which would  give  rise to  a  filing requirement  with the
       Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange
       Act Rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

        (ii) "Good Reason" means:

           (1) a material reduction in the nature or scope of Employee's duties,
       responsibilities, authority,  power or  functions from  those enjoyed  by
       Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control occurring at any time
       during the immediate two year period after the Change in Control; or

           (2)  a good faith determination  by Employee that as  the result of a
       Change in Control and  a material change  in employment circumstances  at
       any  time  during  the immediate  two  year  period after  the  Change in
       Control,  he   is  unable   to  carry   out  his   assigned  duties   and
       responsibilities  in a  manner consistent with  the practices, standards,
       values or philosophy of  the Company immediately prior  to the Change  in
       Control; or

           (3)  a relocation of the primary place  of employment of at least 100
       miles.

        (iii) "Disability" means:

           (1) a physical or mental condition which has prevented Employee  from
       substantially  performing  his  assigned  duties  for  a  period  of  180
       consecutive days and  which is  expected to continue  to render  Employee
       unable  to  substantially perform  his duties  on  a full-time  basis and
       otherwise meets  the benefit  eligibility requirements  of the  Company's
       Long  Term  Disability  Welfare  Benefit  Plan.  The  Company  will  make
       reasonable accommodation for any handicap of Employee as may be  required
       by applicable law.

           In  the event  of termination by  the Company for  Disability after a
       Change in  Control, a  good faith  determination of  the existence  of  a
       Disability  shall be made by resolution  of the Compensation Committee of
       the Board of Directors of the Company, in

                                       5
<PAGE>
       its sole  discretion, setting  forth the  particulars of  the  Disability
       which  shall  be final  and binding  upon the  Employee. The  Company may
       require the submission of  such medical evidence as  to the condition  of
       the  Employee  as  it  may  deem necessary  in  order  to  arrive  at its
       determination of  the  occurrence  of a  Disability,  and  Employee  will
       cooperate  in providing any  such information. Employee  will be provided
       with reasonable opportunity to present additional medical evidence as  to
       the  medical condition of  Employee for consideration  prior to the Board
       making its determination of the occurrence of a Disability.

           Upon termination  of Employment  by Company  for Disability  after  a
       Change  in Control, Employee will receive Disability payments pursuant to
       the Company's short and long  term Disability welfare benefit plans  then
       in  effect  according to  the  terms of  such  plans and  continue  to be
       eligible to  participate  in  the  Company's  medical,  dental  and  life
       insurance  programs  then  in effect  and  available to  officers  of the
       Company in accordance with their terms for  a period of 3 years from  the
       date of such termination of this Agreement.

        (iv) "Cause" means:

           (1)  any material breach  by Employee of any  statutory or common law
       duty of loyalty, or

           (2) any material breach of this  Agreement which, if curable, is  not
       cured  within  ten (10)  days of  notice  thereof to  Employee; provided,
       however,  termination  of   employment  for  unsatisfactory   performance
       (including   failure  to  meet  financial  goals)  shall  not  constitute
       termination for Cause.

           Termination for Cause  shall be limited  to a good  faith finding  by
       resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of AAR
       CORP.  setting forth  the particulars thereof.  Any such  action shall be
       taken at  a  regular or  specially  called meeting  of  the  Compensation
       Committee  of  the  Board, after  a  minimum  10 days  notice  thereof to
       Employee, with termination of Employee's employment with the Company  for
       Cause  listed  as an  agenda item.  Employee will  be given  a reasonable
       opportunity to be heard at such meeting with counsel present if  Employee
       desires. Any such resolution shall be final and binding.

           Upon  termination  of employment  by  Company for  Cause,  no further
       compensation or  benefits  shall accrue  or  be payable  to  Employee  by
       Company  except for any compensation, bonus  or other benefits which have
       accrued to Employee prior to the date of any such termination.

           Nothing herein  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  the  Company  from
       terminating  Employee's employment at  any time for any  reason or for no
       reason.

    (c) The  Company  will  pay reasonable  legal/attorney's  fees  incurred  by
Employee  in  connection with  enforcement of  any right  or benefit  under this
Section 6.

    7.   CHANGES  IN  BUSINESS.    The Company,  acting  through  its  Board  of
Directors,  will at all times have  complete control over the Company's business
and retirement and other  employee health and  welfare benefit plans  ("Plans").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any time or
times  change or discontinue any  or all of its  present or future operations or
Plans (subject  to their  terms), may  close  or move  any one  or more  of  its
divisions  or offices, may  undertake any new servicing  or sales operation, may
sell any one or more of its divisions or offices to any company not  controlled,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or may take any and all other steps which
its    Board   of   Directors,   in   its   exclusive   judgment,   shall   deem

                                       6
<PAGE>
desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or recourse against the Company, its
officers, directors or employees by reason of such action except for enforcement
of the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement.

    8.  SEVERANCE PAYMENT AS SOLE  OBLIGATION.  Except as expressly provided  in
Sections  4  and  6 above,  no  further compensation,  payments,  liabilities or
benefits shall  accrue  or  be payable  to  Employee  upon or  as  a  result  of
termination  of Employee's employment  for any reason  whatsoever except for any
compensation, bonus or  other benefits which  accrued to Employee  prior to  the
date of employment termination.

    The  amounts paid to  the Employee under  Section 4 and  6 of this Agreement
shall be considered severance pay in consideration of past services Employee has
rendered to the  Company and  in consideration of  Employee's continued  service
from the date hereof to entitlement to those payments.

    9.   NOTICES.  Any notice or other instrument or thing required or permitted
to be given, served or delivered to any of the parties hereto shall be delivered
