<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M29"></A>Formation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M30"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;The Company is incorporated in Delaware.  The Company was originally organized as A.L. Laboratories, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S., a Norwegian healthcare company (the predecessor company to A.L. Industrier ASA).  In 1994, the Company acquired the complementary human pharmaceutical and animal health business of its parent company and subsequently changed its name to Alpharma Inc. to operate worldwide as one corporate entity</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.   </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M31"></A>Controlling Stockholder</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M32"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;A. L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier") beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock, or approximately 22% of the Company's total common stock outstanding at December 31, 2004.   The Class B common stock currently bears the right to elect more than a majority of the Company's Board of Directors and to cast a majority of the votes in any vote of the Company's stockholders.  Mr. Einar W. Sissener, Chairman of the Board of the Company and a controlling stockholder of Industrier, and members of his immediate family, also beneficially own 373,667 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.  As a result of the ownership of the Class B shares, Industrier, and ultimately Mr. Sissener, can control the Company. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M51"></A>The Company intends to continue its focus on free cash flow in 2005.   The Company is evaluating the possible sale of assets which could include one or more businesses.  It is possible that, if completed, one or more divestitures may materially alter the Company's operations and financial status. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the Company in 2005, intends to invest an amount (not greater than $500 million) equal to the cash dividends received from its foreign subsidiaries for permitted investments in the United States under a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is also considering the possible re-financing of certain portions of its outstanding 3% convertible debt to increase its financial flexibility.  <A NAME="_DV_M52"></A></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Management and Financial Reporting Structure</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M53"></A>The Company operates in the human and animal pharmaceuticals industry.  For financial reporting purposes it has five businesses within these industries:  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API"), Branded Pharmaceuticals ("BP"), International Generics ("IG"), U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals ("USG") and Animal Health ("AH"). International Generics was formerly called International Pharmaceuticals.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until 2004, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and Branded Pharmaceuticals businesses were treated as one segment for reporting purposes and were referred to collectively as U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP").  However, since January 2004, USG and BP have functioned as separate operational units.  For management purposes, since January 2004, USG and IG have operated under a single divisional president with certain other senior managers also having responsibilities across both business segments. Since 2003, BP, AH and API have operated under individual management teams.<A NAME="_DV_M54"></A></P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M73"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;The Human Pharmaceuticals business, through its various business segments, manufactures and markets generic pharmaceuticals, brand name pharmaceutical products and a line of fermentation based products that are used primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS ("API")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M91"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;The Company's Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API") business develops, manufactures and markets a range of antibiotic fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products. The Company's API business benefits from over four decades of experience in the use and development of fermentation and purification technology. Additionally, the Company's API business' fermentation expertise in the production of bulk antibiotics has a direct technological application to the manufacture of products for the Company's Animal Health business.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M92"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Product Lines.  </I>The Company's API business markets and sells approximately 10 antibiotic APIs.  APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections.  The Company is a leading producer of bacitracin, polymyxin, and vancomycin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics. The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotics such as amphotericin B parenteral grade, tobramycin and colistin for injectable use and use in specialized topical and surgical human applications.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M93"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;The Company has expanded certain of its facilities in order to address capacity constraints with respect to some of the products in its API business' portfolio.  (See "Facilities" below.)  In February 2003, the Company's API business implemented a significant price increase for certain of its products in certain geographical markets. (See "Management Discussion and Analysis" for information on 2005 pricing disclosures.)  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M94"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;Facilities.  </I>The Company manufactures its API products in its plants in Oslo, Norway, which also manufactures products for Animal Health; Copenhagen, Denmark, which also manufactures finished products for IG; and Budapest, Hungary.  Each plant includes fermentation, specialized recovery and purification equipment.  To support the production of vancomycin, the Company substantially expanded its production capacity at its Copenhagen facility and in 1998, acquired its facility in Budapest, Hungary. An expansion of manufacturing processes and capacity at the Budapest facility was substantially completed in 2004.<B>  <A NAME="_DV_C9"></B>The expansion of the Budapest facility cost a total of approximately $9.0 million and doubled the capacity of the facility for one product and established capacity for the production of three additional products in the facility.<B>  <A NAME="_DV_M95"></A></A></B>(See "Information Applicable To All B
usiness Segments Environmental Compliance" for a discussion of an administrative action related to the Budapest facility.)  The Company completed the expansion of its purification capacity in Copenhagen in the fourth quarter of 2004 for a total cost of approximately $15.0 million. <A NAME="_DV_C10">  In the first quarter of 2004, the previous expansion of the Copenhagen facility was completed at a total cost of approximately $16.7 million.</A> This expansion significantly increased the capacity of the Copenhagen facility for one product. The Oslo and Copenhagen facilities have been classified as acceptable by the FDA as a manufacturer of certain sterile and non-sterile bulk antibiotics.  (See "Government Regulation - FDA Compliance" for a discussion of the Company's FDA inspection results at the Copenhagen and Skoyen facilities).  Such FDA classification, subject to compliance with applicable FDA rules, allows imports of these products into the U.S. market and into most European markets.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M96"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Competition.  </I>In sales to large and small customers, price, quality and service are the determining factors.  The Company believes that its fermentation and purification expertise and established reputation provide it with a significant advantage in these antibiotic products.  Competition has increased as a result of the Company's recent price increases on certain of its products, most notably from Asian based companies.  The Company's API business' principal competitors are: Abbott Laboratories and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M97"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Geographic Markets.</I>  The Company's API business sells its products in the U.S. and other areas of the world.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, sales in North America of API products represented approximately 64% of the Company's API business' total revenues. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M98"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers.  </I>Sales of API products are dependent on finished product sales, which are under the control of the Company's customers.  Sales of bulk antibiotic products are made to relatively few large customers, primarily pharmaceutical companies making generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  The Company distributes and sells its API products in North America and Europe using its own sales force.  Sales of the Company's API products in other parts of the world are primarily through the use of local agents and distributors. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3 COLOR="#ffffff"> </P>

Additionally, it markets a third party's branded prescription product in a tablet dosage form Pexeva.  BP is currently focused on the pain management market in the United States.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Product Lines.</I>  Kadian is a sustained release morphine product which, as a part of the Faulding Acquisition, F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mayne Nickless Limited) licensed to BP pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license.  Kadian was one of the products acquired as part of the 2001 acquisition of Purepac.  BP has a sales force of approximately 175 sales representatives<U> </U>and is in the process of expanding this sales force to approximately 195 representatives in 2005. BP focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the pain specialists who are likely to be the most active writers of prescriptions for its products. In addition to its sales and marketing efforts the Company continues to seek product development and co-promotion opportunities with other pharmaceutical companies to enhance its product portfolio and to expand the scope of its efforts.  Since July 2004, the Company has entered into two promotional arrangements with third partie
s.  One arrangement is with a biopharmaceutical company for the promotion of Kadian to oncology healthcare professionals in the United States.  The second arrangement is for the Company's sales force to promote Pexeva, a product manufactured and marketed by a third party. Pexeva is a branded selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of depression, obsessive/compulsive disorder, and/or panic disorder.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities.  </I>BP's one product is manufactured at the Company's facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which also manufactures USG tablet and capsule products.   All manufacturing and raw material sourcing activities are performed by USG.  BP's headquarters are located in Piscataway, New Jersey.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Competition. </I>BP operates in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company's BP products compete with pain management products manufactured by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and worldwide research-based brand drug companies.  As the Company expands its BP portfolio product line, it expects to encounter continued competition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BP's principal competitors, all of which are believed to have significantly higher shares of the pain management market, are: Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Janssen Pharmaceutica and Purdue Pharma.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales, Distribution and Customers.</I>  The Company has a sales organization for BP's branded pharmaceutical products.  The Company<I> </I>maintains a professional direct sales force of approximately 161 retail and 14 non-retail sales representatives to distribute and direct market BP's products.  The Company is in the process of expanding its BP retail sales force to approximately 195 representatives.  BP predominately sells pharmaceutical products to the warehousing and non-warehousing chains, as well as wholesalers, hospitals, long-term care providers, managed care providers and mail order companies.  The Company has no long-term agreements with any of these accounts.  Any cessation or material reduction of certain customers' purchases would likely have a material effect on the Company's sales and profitability.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M83"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;In December 2001, as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired 90% of Alpharma (Foshan) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (formerly Foshan Faulding Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.) ("Alpharma Foshan").  A corporation controlled by the government of the City of Foshan owns the remaining 10% of Alpharma Foshan.  Alpharma Foshan manufactures and distributes generic oral pharmaceutical products and traditional Chinese medicines in the southern and eastern portions of China.  (See "U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals - Acquisitions" for a discussion of the Faulding Acquisition.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M84"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;In January 2003, the Company divested its vitamin business to Nopal AS ("Nopal"), which, at the time of such transaction, was a subsidiary of Industrier, the Company's controlling stockholder, for approximately $3.3 million.  In connection with this sale, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Nopal pursuant to which the Company will supply Nopal with certain vitamin products, and two distribution agreements with Nopal pursuant to which Nopal would continue to sell the Company's medical plaster and tape products to the grocery sector and the Company would sell Nopal's acquired vitamin products to the pharmacy and health care sector.  The supply agreement and distribution agreements were terminated on December&nbsp;31, 2003 and February 27, 2004, respectively. The termination of these agreements has had a minimal impact on the Company's operations in 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_IPM1"><A NAME="_DV_C6"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;In October 2003, <A NAME="_DV_X2604"><A NAME="_DV_C7"></A>the Company divested its <A NAME="_DV_C8"></A></A>French generic pharmaceutical business to Zydus International Private Ltd. for approximately $6.0 million plus further payments of approximately $0.6 million, contingent upon receipt of marketing approvals from the French government for certain products in the approval process as of the date of the sale and the consent of third party suppliers.</A>  This business was purchased in April 1999 for $26.4 million.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M85"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Facilities</I>.  The Company maintains six manufacturing facilities for its IG products, all of which also house administrative offices and warehouse space.  The Company's plants in Lier, Norway and Barnstaple, England, include many technologically advanced applications for the manufacturing of tablet, liquid and ointment products.  The Company's plant in Copenhagen, Denmark manufactures a limited number of sterile finished pharmaceutical products.  In addition to the Lier, Barnstaple and Copenhagen facilities, the Company also operates plants in Vennesla, Norway, for medical plaster and tape products, and Jakarta, Indonesia, for tablets, ointments and liquids.  The Jakarta plant is certified by European authorities for export to Europe.  Through Alpharma Foshan, the Company also operates a manufacturing plant in Foshan City in the Guangdong Province of China.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M86"><A NAME="_DV_M87"></A></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;Competition</I>.  Most of the Company's international finished pharmaceutical products compete with one or more other products that contain the same active ingredient in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company therefore competes on the basis of price, product range, service and brand. IG's principal competitors are:  Merck KGaA, Nycomed Holding ApS, Pliva d.d., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Inc., Ratiopharm Inc., Sandoz GmbH, Stada GmbH, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. In European countries in recent years, sales of generic pharmaceuticals have been increasing relative to sales of patent-protected pharmaceuticals.  Generics are gaining market share on a volume basis because, among other things, governments are attempting to reduce pharmaceutical expenses by enacting regulations that promote the use of generic pharmaceuticals in lieu of more expensive branded formulations.  The Company's int
ernational generic products also encounter competition from imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws promoting free movement of goods.  It is also encountering increased pressure from new entrants into the market, many of whom are from countries with a lower cost basis (such as China, India and countries in Eastern Europe), and therefore, are able to supply product at lower prices.  To meet this competitive force, in February of 2005, the Company entered into an arrangement to source certain products from India and is in active negotiations with additional Indian suppliers. (For more information on this arrangement, see "USG - Competition".)   To remain competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market, it is also critical that scheduled product launches enter the market on time.  Additionally, in certain EU jurisdictions such as the U.K. and Germany, maximum pricing legislation is resulting in lower prices and impacting the Company's ability to compete on the basis of price in su
ch jurisdictions.  (See "Government Regulation" and "Risk Factors".) </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M88"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Geographic Markets</I>.  The principal geographic markets for IG's products are the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands, the Nordic countries and other Western European countries, Indonesia, China and the Middle East.  Additionally, the Company has sales in select other Asian and African markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M89"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers</I>.  Depending on the characteristics of each geographic market, IG's products are predominantly marketed under either brand or generic names.  Over-the-counter products are typically marketed under brand names with concentration on skin care, pain relief and vitamins.  IG's primary customers are integrated wholesalers (wholesale and retail outlets), pharmacy retail chains, purchasing organizations and government entities.  To position itself towards the integrated wholesalers who are gradually becoming significant Pan-European parties, IG is targeting both the local market organizations and the corporate offices of these customers.  IG employs a specialized marketing and sales force of approximately 540 persons (with the largest number being approximately 210 in Indonesia, 102 in Germany and 58 in China) that markets and promotes generic pharmaceuticals to doctors, hospitals, wholesalers, pharmac
ies and consumers.    </P>

USG offers products in approximately 150 formulations and dosage forms including solid, semi-solid and liquid dosage forms.   With the addition of Purepac, an oral solid dose pharmaceutical business purchased as part of the Faulding Acquisition completed in 2001, the Company's customers can buy from a broadened product line that encompasses liquid, semi-solid, solid oral dose, unit dose, topical, suppositories and inhalation products.  Since 2002, the Company has, and continues to, reconfigure the mix of its product portfolio to emphasize more profitable products over less profitable products and to enable the Company's facilities to engage in various cGMP remediation efforts.

USG manufactures and markets products using approximately 110 APIs that are sold in over 150 different formulations and dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, creams, ointments, suppositories and liquid inhalants, in its line of over-the-counter and prescription medications.  The experience and technical expertise of USG enables it to formulate immediate and modified release medications in oral solid dosage forms.  It also enables USG to develop therapeutic equivalent drugs in liquid and topical forms, and refine product characteristics, such as taste, texture and appearance in the case of liquid forms, and color, texture and consistency in the case of topical forms.  USG manufactures and markets generic prescription products in approximately 75 tablet and capsule formulations and dosages.  USG manufactures approximately 50 generic cream, lotion, suppository and ointment form

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M103"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Generic Prescription Pharmaceuticals</I>.  USG has regulatory approvals, each of which permits USG to manufacture and sell a given product, for approximately 120 generic prescription products with a total of approximately 160 dosage strengths.  The prescription products consist of a line of specialty liquid products for approximately 10 different indications, including cough/cold, allergy and respiratory, a broad line of creams and ointments with a concentration on first aid medications, and a broad line of oral solid dose products with a concentration on modified release formulations in a variety of therapeutic categories including cardiovascular, anti-depressants, tranquilizers and analgesics. Based on revenue, USG's most successful generic drugs in 2004 were: </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The 2004 sales of gabapentin were pursuant to the Company's 180-day exclusivity granted pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act.  This period of exclusivity extends into 2005, and therefore the Company anticipates continued significant gabapentin sales in 2005.  The Company is sharing its exclusivity with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ("Teva") pursuant to a selective waiver agreement under which Teva will: (i) indemnify the Company for a portion of any damages which could be awarded should the Company lose the Pfizer patent infringement litigation (see "Legal Proceedings - Gabapentin") and (ii) make certain royalty payments based upon Teva's sales contingent upon the Company being successful in the Pfizer patent infringement litigation. The Company is also purchasing the active ingredient for gabapentin from Teva pursuant to an agreement that provides for the payment to Teva of a portion of the Company's net sales of gabapentin. In addition, Pfizer, through a subsidiary, is marketing a 
gabapentin authorized generic during the 180-day exclusivity period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 2003 the Company entered into an agreement with Ivax Pharmaceutical Co.

USG's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid pharmaceuticals.  (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".)  The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments, lotions, liquids and suppositories.  As a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's solid oral dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules<A NAME="_DV_M109"></A>, and the Piscataway facility, which houses the corporate offices of BP is also used for USG warehousing and certain scientific affairs functions.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M118"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;Competition.  </I>Legislation in the U.S. encourages the use of generics as an alternative to brand drugs, including mandating the use of generics in Medicaid programs across the country, and generally allows <A NAME="_DV_M119"></A>pharmacy substitution of brand drugs with generic drugs.  The Company operates in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company competes in this business on the basis of price, product range and customer service.  The Company competes with other generic pharmaceutical companies and with the generic drug divisions of major international branded drug companies that sell one or more products similar to the Company's products.  (See "Risk Factors" and "Legal Proceedings - Gabapentin".)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, the Company encounters market entry resistance from patented drug manufacturers.  The Company, as with other generic players, continually attempts to introduce its products to market at advantageous times.  The most important method of such product introduction is to take advantage of market exclusivity opportunities afforded by the Hatch-Waxman statutes by invalidating existing patents on or developing generically equivalent products that do not infringe existing patents (a "Paragraph IV Filing").  Under certain circumstances, if the Company is the first-to-file under Paragraph IV, it may be entitled to be the only generic manufacturer on the market for a 180-day period.  The Company has encountered vigorous challenges to these activities that have resulted in significant legal costs as it has defended its right to market these products.  The Company expects to face further legal costs as it continues to defend such challenges.  The Company might be unsuccessful in defending
 these challenges. Recently, efforts by patent drug manufacturers have created market competition for first-to-file ANDA holders during their 180-day period of exclusivity through the licensing of generic versions of their branded, or NDA, products to affiliated or partnered generic distributors ("Authorized Generics"). This development has reduced the financial return available to generic ANDA holders during their statutory (Paragraph IV) exclusivity period, by creating market competition in what had been a statutory monopoly period. The Company observed this with its gabapentin product (See "Legal Proceedings - Gabapentin").  The creation of Authorized Generics is currently the subject of litigation not involving the Company, there is no assurance that the practice will be abated in the foreseeable future. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is also beginning to encounter competition from new market entrants importing goods into the U.S. from countries with a lower cost basis.  To meet this competitive force, in February 2005 the Company entered into an agreement with Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. ("Orchid") pursuant to which Orchid agreed to: (i) develop active pharmaceutical ingredients and final formulations, and (ii) manufacture finished products, for exclusive sale by the Company in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Company is actively negotiating additional sourcing agreements with suppliers in Asia.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M152"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;Approval also must be granted in the U.S. for the use of an animal drug in combination with other animal drugs in feeds.  Such combination approval generally requires the cooperation of other manufacturers to consent to authorize the FDA to refer to such manufacturer's NADA in <A NAME="_DV_M153"></A>support of the Company's regulatory submissions.  This consent is necessary to obtain approval from the FDA for more than one animal drug to be included in a given animal drug animal feed at the same time.  To date, the Company has been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many of its products.  Generally, the Company does not enter into written agreements with other manufacturers and does not pay any money to other manufacturers to obtain such consent.  These combination clearances significantly extend the reach and potential market share of the Company's products and provide a conside

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M158"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Facilities.  </I>The Company produces its Animal Health products in several manufacturing facilities.  BMD is produced and blended at the Company's Chicago Heights, Illinois facility, which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant.  Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility, which is managed by API.  The majority of soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH's Longmont, Colorado facility. Feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH's Willow Island, West Virginia facility in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers.  It is then blended at independent blending facilities.  In 2004, the Company received FDA approval to commence manufacturing lasalocid at its Willow Island facility for sales in the U.S.  Now, in addition to manufacturing chlortetracycline, the Willow Island facility also produces lasalocid for use in the U.S. as well as many other parts of the world. Bio-Cox is blended in AH's Van Bur

The 3-Nitro product line <A NAME="_DV_M159"></A>is manufactured using the Company's technology at a third party facility.   Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in accordance with an agreement that expires in 2012 using the Company's technology at a facility owned and operated by a third party.  In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved from the Company's Lowell, Arkansas facility to the Company's Chicago Heights facility.

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M161"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;Competition.  </I>The Company competes in a highly competitive market on the basis of price, brand name and customer service.  Some of the Company's competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities.  Some of AH's principal competitors include Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco) and Phibro Animal Health Corporation.  Due to the Company's strong market position in MFAs and its experience in obtaining requisite FDA approvals for combination claims, the Company believes it enjoys a competitive advantage in marketing MFAs under the FDA approved combination clearances.  However, no assurances can be given that third parties will continue to cooperate in seeking combination approval for the Company's products, and the Company expects new entrants in the generic medicated animal feed additive market in 2005. </P>

</B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;General</I>.  The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other government agencies and by comparable authorities in the EU, Norway, Indonesia and other countries.  Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is a member of the European Economic Area and, as such, has accepted all EU regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals except in the area of feed antibiotics.  Government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letter
s, civil or criminal fines, actions, including prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and distribution, suspension or withdrawal of product approvals, the Company's debarment or the debarment of individuals from obtaining new drug approvals or providing services to drug companies in any capacity, refusal of the government to approve new products or to purchase the Company's products and criminal prosecution.  The cost of complying with government regulations substantially increases the cost of producing the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements (including the possibility of future changes in statutes or regulations), the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and analogous state and foreign agencies, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time the Company will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite the Company's efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements.  As a result of actions the Company has taken to respond to the progressively more demanding regulatory environment in which the Company operates, the Company has spent, and will continue to spend, significant funds and management time on regulatory compliance. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;If the drug to be offered is a generic variation of a branded product that is the subject of an NDA approved for both safety and effectiveness, the generic product must be the subject of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, and be approved by the FDA prior to marketing.  Drug products which are generic copies of the other types of branded products generally may be marketed in accordance with either FDA enforcement policies or the over-the-counter drug monograph program which describes active ingredients and labeled uses the FDA has determined are safe and effective and do not require NDA approval and generally are not subject to ANDA filings and approval prior to market introduction at this time.  While the Company believes that the Company's current pharmaceutical products are appropriately marketed under the applicable FDA procedure or current enforcement policy, the basis for marketing products not covered by approved ANDAs is
 subject to change or revocation by the FDA.  The status of all products is also subject to change if experience reveals significant new adverse information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;All applications for regulatory approval of generic drug products subject to ANDA requirements must contain data relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and quality control, among other information.  ANDAs also must contain data demonstrating the bioequivalence of the generic drug to the branded drug.  Each product approval limits manufacturing to a specifically identified site or sites.  Supplemental filings to allow the manufacture of products at new sites also generally require review and approval.  In addition, certain changes to the Company's manufacturing process, drug ingredients and labeling also can require regulatory review and approval.  New product approvals or approvals to change products might not be obtained in a timely manner, if ever.  Failure to obtain these approvals, or to obtain them when expected, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
      &#9;Most of the Company's animal health products are regulated by the FDA or equivalent regulatory authorities around the world, similarly to the human pharmaceuticals, while other animal health products are regulated primarily by individual States.  Although the Company markets some generic animal drug products, which are subject to similar FDA requirements as applicable to its human generic pharmaceutical products, many of its animal drug products are considered to be branded or pioneer animal drug products.  Like their human counterparts, pre-marketing approval under stringent FDA rules for their testing, development, and manufacture is required for animal drugs as well as for any changes in label claims, specifications or manufacturing sites that occur post-approval.  The backlog of submissions pending review in FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine has made the timing of such approvals difficult to predict.  Despite the difficulty and delays brought about by this situation, the Company has been suc
cessful in obtaining such approvals.  As with human pharmaceutical products, FDA inspection and record keeping requirements as well as debarment provisions apply to the Company's Animal Health products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
    &#9;Legislative bills are introduced in the U.S. Congress and individual states from time to time, some of which, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on AH's business.  However, in the past, such bills that could have had a material adverse effect, have not had sufficient support to become law.  The animal health industry is actively engaged in the legislative process.  To address the previously mentioned review backlog, the industry supported legislation adopting user fees and performance standards similar to those in place for new human drugs and medical devices.  The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 is now in effect (providing for such fees and standards).  The Company believes that this legislation will make the regulatory process for some of the Company's Animal Health products more predictable in the future.</P>

     &#9;<I>EU Product Marketing Authority.</I>  EU legislation requires that medical products for human use must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the EU.  The criteria upon which grant of an authorization is assessed are quality, safety and efficacy.  Demonstration of safety and efficacy in particular requires clinical trials on human subjects, which are subject to the standards codified in the EU guideline on Good Clinical Practice; provided that certain countries granted membership in the EU as of May 1, 2004 may, until a given date specified for each country, individually authorize the continued marketing of products that do not qualify for marketing authorization under EU law if such products were approved by the individual country prior to being granted EU membership.  In addition, the EU legislation requires that such trials be preceded by adequate pharmacological and toxicological tests in animals, that stability tests are to be carried out, that clinical trials 
use controls and that clinical trials be carried out double blind and be capable of statistical analysis by using specific criteria wherever possible, rather than relying on a large sample size.  The working party on the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products has also made various recommendations in this area.  Analogous governmental and agency approvals are similarly required in other countries where the Company conducts business.  There can be no assurance that new product approvals will be obtained by the Company in a timely manner, if ever.  Failure to obtain these approvals, or to obtain them when expected, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;Similar requirements apply to the granting of marketing authorizations for medicinal products for veterinary use in EU countries.  If the Company fails to obtain such marketing authorizations, or fails to obtain them in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's Animal Health business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;Generic medicinal products for human and veterinary use may be authorized in the EU through abridged authorization applications.  For example, the EU marketing authorization applications do not need to contain results of toxicological and pharmacological tests and results of clinical trials provided that certain conditions are met, and in particular that the "original" medicinal product has been authorized in the EU for at least six years (and in certain cases ten years) and has been in the market in the member state where the marketing authorization application has been submitted.  Abridged applications must refer to information contained in the dossier of the "original" product for which a marketing authorization has been granted on the basis of a complete dossier.  The original complete dossier in question must be a dossier at the disposal of the competent authority concerned.  This implies that abridged applications must be lodged with the authorities that actually hold the dossier for the "orig
inal" product.  The "original" product referred to must still be authorized at the time the abridged application is submitted.  To qualify for abridged dossiers, the product must be considered to be a generic of a reference medicinal product.  A generic medicinal product is a medicinal product which has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances, the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, and whose bioequivalence to the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate studies.  Different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with respect to safety and/or efficacy.  In such cases, additional information demonstrating the safety and/or efficacy of the various salts, esters, or, derivatives of an authorized substance must be supplied by the applicant.  If the Company fails to satisfy t
he conditions for the use of abridged authorization applications for new products being developed by the Company, the process for the approval of such products could take significantly longer and cost substantially more to the Company.   Generic feed additive products in the EU used to promote animal health (specifically anticoccidial products) and nutrition are regulated under different legislation than veterinary pharmaceuticals.  The regulatory procedures for handling these products are undergoing revision.  It is expected that applications for generic feed additives will require the same types of data necessary needed to obtain authorization of the original product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;As of October 31, 2005, changes to the abridged authorization procedure described above will be implemented for human pharmaceuticals.  These changes will require submission of an environmental risk assessment in connection with an application for a marketing authorization and will permit the filing of an application for a generic drug marketing authorization eight years after the date upon which the reference drug was granted marketing rights with the commencement of generic marketing permitted no earlier than 10 years after the date the reference drug was granted marketing rights.  In some cases, this change will eventually delay the introduction of generic drugs, such as the Company's products, by two years in those countries that presently apply a six year exclusivity period. </P>

     &#9;The European Union and one non-EU country banned the use of four antibiotics to promote growth in food producing animals effective July 1, 1999, and will extend this ban to the remaining approved growth promoting antibiotics by 2006.  In the list of products banned in 1999, only one, bacitracin zinc, was manufactured and marketed by the Company.  The Company's attempt to reverse or limit the EU ban that affects the Company's Albac product, was not successful.  Similar actions to ban or severely restrict the use in animals of antibiotics have been taken by EU trading partners or are being contemplated. (See "Risk Factors".)

The Company's manufacturing operations in the U.S. and two of the Company's European facilities that manufacture products for export to the U.S. are required to comply with the FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations ("cGMP").  cGMP encompasses all aspects of the production process, including validation and record keeping, in addition to standards for facilities, equipment and personnel, and involves changing and evolving standards. There are similar cGMP regulations in other countries where the Company has manufacturing operations.  The EU requires that before a medicinal product can be manufactured and assembled, each company that carries out such an operation must hold a manufacturer's license and the manufacture and assembly must be in accordance with the marketing authorization and cGMP.  It also requires that active substances used in medicinal products for human and veterinary use be manufactured following guidelines on good manu

     &#9;In addition to European Regulatory agencies, the Company is subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA.  During 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company received substantial inspection observations on Form 483 ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USG and BP facilities in Baltimore and Elizabeth. The 483 Reports listed deviations from cGMPs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has not formally commented on the Company's corrective action plan.  The FDA performed another inspection of the Baltimore facility in February of 2004 and issued a 483 Report detailing plant deficiencies.  While the FDA has not indicated to the Company its position as to any of the items set forth on this February 2004 483 Report, the number and scope of the comments in this Report have declined significantly from the Report received in August 2002.  The Company will continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore plant in accordance w
ith the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the FDA.   As part of the corrective action plan, product recalls were conducted in 2002 and production at the Baltimore facility was reduced in several increments during 2002 and 2003.  This reduction in production has had a negative effect on earnings that the Company expects to continue in 2005. The Company anticipates a follow-up full cGMP inspection at the Baltimore facility in 2005 at which time it anticipates to demonstrate substantial completion of the October 2002 corrective action plan. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;Between November 2002 and January 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA on January 15, 2003.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response on February 5, 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response. The FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report citing continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations.  The Company completed a significant portion of its corrective actions in 2004, and expects to complete the remainder by December 2006.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The regulatory status and the Company's corrective action activities at the Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities has had an adverse impact on the Company's ability to obtain new product marketing approvals. For its Baltimore facility the Company did not file any applications for new product approvals in 2004. As a result of a successful follow-up FDA inspection in the third quarter of 2004, the Company has obtained three ANDA approvals which have allowed it to release new products from the Elizabeth facility.  Additionally, one tentative approval was received. In anticipation of the outcome of the third quarter 2004 Elizabeth inspection, the Company filed six ANDA applications and one NDA supplement from the Elizabeth facility. The Company also filed three additional applications from other sites, bringing the total number of new applications to ten.  The Company plans to increase its filings at Elizabeth modestly in 2005.  </P>

     &#9;The Company incurred outside consulting costs in connection with regulatory compliance issues at Baltimore and Elizabeth of approximately $3.2 million during 2002, $18 million in 2003, and $9.2 million in 2004.  The Company estimates that the 2005 cost of addressing the deviations listed in those 483 Reports at Baltimore and Elizabeth will be approximately $2.0 million for outside consultants and related costs.  In addition, the Company has expanded its ongoing quality assurance costs, including adding related personnel, at a cost of approximately $18.0 million in 2004.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Potential Liability for Current Products</I>.  Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products, including the Company's products, and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.  While the Company believes that it is unlikely that an adverse finding in any single study regarding any of the Company's products will result in such regulatory measures without further findings, publicity raised by such a study could cause some of the Company's customers to decrease or stop their use of such product, 
resulting in an adverse affect on the sales of such product.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Extended Protection for Certain Products</I>.  In 1984, The Hatch-Waxman Act amended  both  the Patent Code and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, better known as the FDC Act.  The Hatch-Waxman Act codified and expanded application procedures for obtaining FDA approval for generic versions of patented drug manufacturers that are off-patent or whose market exclusivity has expired.  The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides patent extension and market exclusivity provisions for brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers which preclude the submission or delay the approval of a competing ANDA under certain conditions.  One such provision allows a five year market exclusivity period for NDAs involving new chemical entities and a three year market exclusivity period for NDAs or NDA supplements containing new clinical investigations essential to the approval of such application.  The market exclusivity provisions apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products.  Another provi
sion authorizes the extension of patent terms for up to five years as compensation for some of the reductions of the effective life of the patent as a result of time spent in testing for, and FDA review of, an application for a drug approval.  Patent terms may also be extended pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, or URAA.  In addition, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 ("FDAMA") allows brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers under certain circumstances to seek six months of additional exclusivity when they have conducted pediatric studies on the drug in accordance with the statute's requirements.  Although the pediatric exclusivity provisions in FDAMA contained a sunset date of January 1, 2002, they were re-authorized by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was signed into law in January 2002.  In addition, the first generic applicant who files an ANDA challenging a patent listed by the brand name manufacturer (i.e. an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification stating tha
t the generic drug will not infringe any listed patent(s) for the reference drug or that such patent(s) is (are) invalid or unenforceable) may receive an exclusivity period of 180 days under certain circumstances during which times other generic applications for the product containing paragraph IV certifications cannot be marketed.  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare Act") made certain changes to the 180-day exclusivity provision and placed additional limits on the circumstances under which first ANDA applicants may be able to enjoy the benefits of exclusivity.  Therefore, the Company cannot predict the extent to which or otherwise existing statutes or new legislation could postpone approval of some of the Company's new products.  Moreover, changes in the statutes or regulations may occur over time.  The Company cannot predict the extent to which any such future changes may affect its products or product development.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;In Europe, a similar market exclusivity in respect of proprietary medicines exists, irrespective of any patent protection.  Before a generic manufacturer can present an abridged application for a marketing authorization, it must generally wait until the original proprietary drug has been approved in the EU for a certain period, unless they have the consent of the person who submitted the original test data for the first marketing authorization, or can compile an adequate dossier of their own.  In the case of high technology products, the period is ten years or in some countries for other medicinal products six years, subject to the option for member states to elect for an exclusivity period of ten years with respect to all products.  As of October 31, 2005, the exclusivity period across EU countries will be harmonized to eight years for the submission of an abridged application and 10 years for generic marketing (as detailed above).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
  &#9;   In addition to the exclusivity period, it is also possible in the EU to extend the period of patent protection for a product which has a marketing authorization by means of a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.  An SPC comes into force on the expiry of the relevant patent and lasts for a period calculated with reference to the delay between the filing of the patent and the granting of the first marketing authorization for the drug.  This period of protection, subject to a maximum of five years, further delays the marketing of generic medicinal products, such as some of the Company's products.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;Controlled Substances Act</I>.  The Company manufactures, develops, and sells Kadian and certain other drug products which are "controlled substances" as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, which establishes certain security personnel, reporting, record keeping and import and export requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or ("DEA"), a division of the Department of Justice.  The Company is registered by the DEA to manufacture and distribute certain controlled substances.  The DEA has a dual mission: law enforcement and regulation. The DEA deals with the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them.  The DEA shares enforcement authority with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another division of the Department of Justice.  The DEA's regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed handlers of controlled substances, and with the substances themselves, equipment and raw materials u

The methods and level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products under Medicare, Medicaid, and other domestic reimbursement programs are the subject of constant review by state and federal governments and private third party payers like insurance companies.  The Company believes that U.S. government agencies will continue to review and assess alternative payment methodologies and reform measures designed to reduce the cost of drugs to the public.  As a part of this effort, the federal government and several states and local jurisdictions have commenced administrative or court actions challenging the pricing practices of certain named drug manufacturers.  The Company is a party to eight such actions and has been notified that several other states, cities or counties are investigating certain of the Company's products with respect to this issue.  Because the outcome of these and other health care reform initiatives is uncertain, the Company ca
nnot predict what impact, if any, they will have on it. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     &#9;Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's selling price based on sales of outpatient drug products reimbursed under state Medicaid programs.  The required rebate rate for manufacturers of generic products is currently 11% of the weighted average selling price for each product at the unit level. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    &#9; In many countries in which the Company does business, other than the U.S., the initial prices of pharmaceutical preparations for human use are dependent upon governmental approval or clearance under governmental reimbursement schemes.  These government programs generally establish prices by reference to either manufacturing costs or the prices of comparable products.  Subsequent price increases may also be regulated.  In past years, as part of overall programs to reduce health care costs, certain European governments have prohibited price increases and have introduced various systems designed to lower prices.  A review of proposed legislative changes to the U.K. generic pharmaceutical market is currently ongoing and as part of the review an interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the U.K. has been introduced.  Maximum pricing legislation generally prohibits the sale of a product to consumers for a price in excess of a specified amount or limi
ts the amount that a government or other payor will reimburse with respect to a specific product, which in many jurisdictions effectively limits the amount that the Company can charge for such product to the reimbursable amount.  In Germany, legislation was introduced in January 2002 which re-adjusted the existing fixed price system, requiring price reductions for certain human generic pharmaceutical products including a large number of the Company's products.  Additionally, while this new German law does permit pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs, there are several exceptions to this law that, in the Company's view, will make it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  During 2003, Germany adopted legislation which will have the effect of reducing the reimbursement level for many of the Company's products commencing in 2004.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    &#9; In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states in the EU regulate the pricing of such products and, in some cases, limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services.  These controls can result in considerable price differences between member states.  There is also a Common External Tariff payable on import of medicinal products into the EU, though exemptions are available in respect of certain products allowing duty free importation.  Where there is no tariff suspension in operation in respect of a medicinal product, an application can be made to import the product duty free, but this is subject to review at the European level to establish whether a member state would be able to produce the product in question instead. These regulations make more difficult the export of products from Barnstaple, England and Lier, Norway to other EU countries. In addition, some of the Company's products are subject to a gove
rnmental quota that restricts the amount that can be imported duty free.</P>

The timing of receipt of governmental approvals, with respect to "paragraph IV certifications", can significantly affect the Company's future revenues and income.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time at which the Company files for regulatory approvals is particularly significant with respect to U.S. human pharmaceuticals. Timing is of material importance when the Company seeks to obtain marketing authorization for its ANDA through the filing of a paragraph IV claim of invalidity or non-infringement against an existing patent. In the case of paragraph IV certifications, the first entity to file an application with the FDA will be eligible for 180 days of market exclusivity.  However, the use of this strategy may involve lengthy litigation, frequently against substantially larger and better-financed pharmaceutical companies and, even if successful, may not always result in an actual award of market exclusivity.  It is unlikely that the Company will be the first-to-file for all, or even a significant percentage, of its paragraph IV certifications and even less likely that any particular paragraph IV certification will actually result in the award of market exclusivity.  In ad
dition, the cost of paragraph IV litigation has been approximately $5 million per year, and based upon the present paragraph IV filing rate, could increase in any one or more years in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>The marketing of "authorized generic" versions of brand name pharmaceutical products during the Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity Period of ANDA generics can materially negatively effect the value of first-to-file paragraph IV opportunities.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, actions by patented drug companies have created market competition for first-to file ANDA holders during their 180-day period of exclusivity, through the licensing of generic versions of their branded, or NDA, products to affiliated or partnered generic distributors ("authorized generics"). This development has reduced the financial return available to generic ANDA holders during their statutory exclusivity period, by creating market competition that tends to lower the price of the subject drug. All of the Company's ANDA generic launches in 2004 were accompanied by authorized generics, including the Company's launch of Gabapentin tablets and capsules, materially reducing the value of the first-to-file opportunity.  While such practice may open opportunities for the Company to partner with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturing companies on the launch of particular authorized products when the Company may not be the first generic to file, 
there can be no guaranty that such transactions will deliver a material return to the Company or offset the revenues lost to the Company as a result of authorized generic competition to its first-to-file ANDA products during the Company's exclusivity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has been and will continue to be affected by price competition and the extension of patent exclusivity.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's generic pharmaceuticals business has historically been subject to intense competition, particularly on the basis of price. As patents and other bases for market exclusivity of branded pharmaceuticals expire, prices typically decline as generic competitors, such as the Company enter the marketplace. Normally, there is a further unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increases. The timing of these price decreases is unpredictable and can result in a significantly curtailed period of profitability for a generic drug. In certain recent product launches, new market entrants (some of which have access to products developed and manufactured in low-cost countries such as India) have offered prices in the marketplace which have had the effect of significantly increasing both the amount and timing of these unit price declines.  While the effect of these price declines varies from product to product, such effect can, on occasion, be material. In addition, brand name
 and patented pharmaceuticals manufacturers frequently take actions to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalents. These actions may include:</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's ability to raise, or in certain instances maintain, prices in its international pharmaceutical business has been and may continue to be severely limited due to a number of factors, including parallel imports and price regulation. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Europe, and to a more limited degree in other international markets, the Company is encountering price pressure from imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws of free movement of goods, which are known as parallel imports.  Parallel imports could lead to lower revenue and operating income for the Company.  The Company's international pharmaceuticals business is also affected by general governmental initiatives to reduce drug prices, including price controls or other restrictions on the Company's industry.  Parallel imports, governmental cost containment and other regulatory efforts could cause lower prices in certain markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany and the Nordic countries, where the Company has significant sales.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;The United Kingdom Department of Health is currently reviewing proposed legislative changes to the United Kingdom generic pharmaceuticals market, and, as part of this review, introduced in August 2000 interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom. Maximum pricing legislation generally prohibits the sale of a product to consumers for a price in excess of a specified amount or limits the amount that a government or other payor will reimburse with respect to a specific product, which in many jurisdictions effectively limits the amount that the Company can charge for such product to the reimbursable amount. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, a downward trend in prices for the Company's human generic pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom resulting, at present, from competitive pressures with the potential for further price decreases as a result of future regulatory actions.  The Company is unab
le to predict the long-term impact these circumstances will have on the Company's United Kingdom operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.  German legislation, enacted in January 2004, has required price reductions and larger patient co-payments for a large number of human generic pharmaceutical products, including a number of the Company's products, including Pentalong which accounts for approximately 33% of its German sales.  New German legislation also permits pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs; however, there are several exceptions to this law which the Company believes have made it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  Overall, the Company expects German legislation to result in lower prices for human generic pharmaceutical products that are expected to result in decreased profitability for all industry participants, including the Company.  The Company is unable to predict the impact these circu
mstances will have on the Company's German operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals in Germany.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Based upon the Company's launch of its gabapentin product prior to a final decision in the Pfizer patent infringement litigation, there is the possibility that the Company may be liable for monetary damages if the Company is ultimately found to infringe the patent.

The increased importance of sales to major wholesalers could continue to affect the Company's ability to charge higher prices for its products.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic human pharmaceuticals market conditions, particularly in the U.S., have been affected in recent years by a fundamental shift in industry distribution, purchasing and stocking patterns resulting from the increased importance of sales to major wholesalers and a concurrent reduction in sales to private label generic distributors.  Given this increased importance, the Company may not have the competitive ability to effectively resist wholesaler programs which generally require lower prices on products sold (including potentially material product rebates and discounts), lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesaler's own marketing programs.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health products are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, record keeping, pricing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  While the Company does not keep records that segregate the cost of compliance with these government regulations, in the aggregate such regulations substantially increase the cost of manufacturing, developing and selling the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations.  These reviews can result in regulatory concerns requiring a response by the Company.  Failure to adequately address these concerns could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including product approval delays, reduced production and production interruptions, among other things.  The significance of the effect of any such failures depends on the severity of the remedy chosen by the government agency.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production or distribution and debarment of individuals from providing services to drug companies in any capacity or debarment of the Company from obtaining new drug approvals, resulting in current charges to income and the potential for future loss of income and increased operating expenses.  In recent years, besides stepped up enforcement of cGMP requirements, the federal government has utilized equit
able disgorgement as a means of enforcing compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations.  There can be no assurance that the FDA would not seek to impose similar sanctions on the Company and any such sanction could have a significant effect on the Company's business and operations.  (See the immediately following risk factor, which deals with corrective action plans involving cGMPs at the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are continually being conducted by the industry, government agencies (including studies required to be performed from time to time by the pharmaceutical company marketing a particular drug) and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ more sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from person who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.  The German government required the Company to provide updated safety and efficacy data on the Company's Pentalong product on or before November of 2004.  The Company has complied with this request but has not yet received a response to its filing. If the Company cannot 
provide data satisfactory to the government, Pentalong's sales authority could be withdrawn.  In the event that sales authority for Pentalong is withdrawn, the Company's operating income would be significantly impacted due to the profitability of this product and the Company would have to consider the impairment of the carrying value of the Pentalong intangible asset.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3 COLOR="#0000ff">  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has submitted comprehensive corrective action plans to the FDA in response to observations received at its Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.  Failure to adequately address these observations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2001, 2002 and 2004, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USG facility in Baltimore.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from standards, primarily cGMPs.  The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation from the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree that required general compliance with cGMPs.  During 2003 and 2004, the Company received two 483 Reports from the FDA as a result of FDA inspections at its USG and BP facility in Elizabeth. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2002 inspection at Baltimore and the 2003 inspection at Elizabeth resulted in 483 Reports in response to which the Company submitted comprehensive corrective action plans to the FDA.   The response to these 483 report observations included product recalls.   The costs of these recalls have already been incurred.  The Baltimore remediation included a production slow-down, which commenced in 2002, intensified in 2003 and continues as of this date.  The Company incurred outside consulting costs of $3.2 million in 2002, $18 million in 2003, and $9 million in 2004.  The estimated total external consultant costs of the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective actions are approximately $2.0 million for 2005. Additional internal costs, primarily for expanded compliance related staff, are being incurred and will continue in future years.  It is possible that these activities will necessitate additional expenditures in the future, although such costs cannot reasonably be estimated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no assurance that the ongoing implementation of the corrective action plans or the FDA's reaction to the status of these facilities will not require further actions at substantial additional costs, including additional product recalls or corrective actions that further restrict production from their current levels.  In addition, future recalls could result in significant costs to the Company, potential disruptions in the supply of the Company's products to its customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm the Company's ability to market its products.  Similarly, a recall of one of the Company's products or a product manufactured by another manufacturer could impair sales of other similar products the Company markets as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FDA compliance status of Baltimore and the Company's corrective action activities at this facility has had, and continues to have, an adverse impact on the Company's ability to launch products at this facility. The Company did not apply for any new product approvals at its Baltimore facility in 2004 and has no product approvals pending out of this site. The Company's corrective action activities at its Elizabeth facility have also had an adverse impact on the Company's ability to launch new products. However, on September 29, 2004, the FDA concluded its most recent inspection at the Company's Elizabeth facility, which resulted in a facility classification permitting new product approvals and the authorization to release products.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product approval delays at any one of the Company's facilities will not necessarily have an effect on product approvals at its other facilities.  If the time necessary to achieve compliance is extended beyond what has been estimated in the Company's corrective action plans, the delay could be materially adverse to the Company.  (See the initial risk factor on the importance of new products.)  In addition to requiring remediation and withholding new product approvals, the FDA also has the authority to impose civil fines and to utilize equitable disgorgement in connection with the 483 Reports or the Baltimore consent decree, although the FDA has not taken any such action with respect to the Company. (See the immediately preceding risk factor, which deals with government regulations.)  Any such action would obviously affect operations in the year imposed and, if such fines or disgorgement were of sufficient size, could have a material adverse affect on the Company's future operations.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the potential transfer of increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals to human pathogens is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals.  While most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that the Company offers for sale, the European Union and one non-EU country banned the use of bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic growth promoter manufactured by the Company and others that has been used in livestock feeds for over 40 years, effective July 1, 1999.  The Company has not sold this product in these countries since the ban took effect.  The EU ban is based upon the "Precautionary Principle", which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by 
scientific certainty.  Although the EU action negatively impacted the Company's business, it was not material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban in the EU will be expanded.  If either: (i) the EU or countries within the EU act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based products, (ii) there is an expansion of the zinc bacitracin ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products, (iii) a similar ban is instituted relating to other antibiotic feed additives sold by the Company in the U.S. or in one or more other countries where the Company has material sales, or (iv) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the Company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  The Company cannot predict whether this antibiotic resistance concern will result in expanded regulations or public pressure adversely affecting other antibiotic-based animal he
alth products previously sold by the Company in the EU or in other countries in which those products are presently sold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions of the antibiotic resistance issue continue actively in the U.S.  Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse human effects from the use of antibiotics in food animals.  Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company's customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics.  It is uncertain what actions, if any, the FDA may take for approved animal drug products.  However, the FDA has proposed a rating system to be used to compare the risks associated with the use of specific antibiotic products in food producing animals, including those sold by the Company.  While the Company does not believe that the presently proposed risk assessment system would be materially adverse to its business, it is subject to change prior to adoption or to later amendment.  The sales of the Company's Animal Health segment are principally antibiotic-based products for use with food producing animals; theref

Any interruption in the supply of these materials, products or an adverse event at the facilities that manufacture and blend the Company's products, could decrease sales of the affected products. In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials or products or to lease or purchase new manufacturing facilities. The Company may be unable to find a third party willing or able to provide the necessary products or facilities suitable for manufacturing pharmaceuticals on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company had to obtain
 substitute materials or products, the Company would require additional regulatory approvals, as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer. The use of new facilities, similarly, would require regulatory approvals. Any significant interruption of supply from the Company's sole source raw material suppliers or third-party manufacturing facilities that are related to products that generate more than $5.0 million in gross profits or any adverse event at any of its manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Fifteen raw materials used in Company products that each generated more than $5.0 million in gross profits in 2004 came from sole source suppliers. The sole source suppliers that provided these raw materials were: Aventis, BASF, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cambrex, Dipharma, DSM, Jinhe, Kaken, PCAS Plantex, Recordati, and Shanghai Sunve.

Third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services and their reimbursement practices may prevent the Company from maintaining the Company's present product price levels. In addition, the market for the Company's products may be limited by third party payers who establish lists of approved products and do not provide reimbursement for products not listed. In the U.S., Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's selling price on sales of certain prescription drugs reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The required rebate rate for manufacturers o

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Company may incur additional debt.  The Company's debt agreements permit the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt. The 2001 Credit Facility is set to expire as to the Term A and the Revolving Credit in October 2007, and as to the Term B in October 2008.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's foreign subsidiaries are expected to generate a significant amount of the cash that the Company needs to service its debt, but their ability to provide the Company with that cash could be restricted.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A substantial portion of the Company's operations is conducted by foreign subsidiaries, which accounted for $620 million of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 and which had $1,083 million of the Company's total assets as of December 31, 2004.  Therefore, the Company's ability to service debt is dependent to a significant extent upon interest payments, cash dividends and distribution or other transfers from the Company's foreign subsidiaries to the Company.  In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to the Company could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdiction in which those foreign subsidiaries operate.  Moreover, payments to the Company by its foreign subsidiaries will be contingent upon their earnings.  Under the Company's senior debt ag
reements, amounts earned which are not permitted to be distributed by the Company's foreign subsidiaries, whether by contract or otherwise, are not included in the Company's measure of EBITDA used to calculate compliance with the covenants in those instruments.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Servicing the Company's debt requires a significant amount of cash, and the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt depends on the Company's ability to generate cash flow.  The Company was required to make $19.4 million in principal payments and interest payments, estimated at over $56 million, in 2004.  The Company's ability to make this payment, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.  In addition, the Company's ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on its satisfaction of the financial covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility and other debt agreements.  The Company's business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to the Company under the 2001 Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cas
h, it may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity.  The Company may not be able to refinance any of its debt on favorable terms, or at all.  Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance the Company's debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's business has been affected by remediation impacting its ability to obtain new product approvals and adding costs that could hinder its ability to generate cash.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's financial results have been materially affected by the remediation and other external issues that it has faced since 2001 (see "Risk Factors - Comprehensive Corrective Action Plan").  In addition, the effort required by these remediation efforts and the Company's ability to obtain new product approvals has also adversely impacted cash flow.  If such costs were to increase, or if the Company's capacity was to be decreased, or the Company is unable to introduce significant new products, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Covenant restrictions under the Company's outstanding debt instruments may limit the Company's ability to operate its business.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;The Company's outstanding debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of the Company to finance future operations and capital needs and engage in certain other business activities.  For example, the 2001 Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  There have been six amendments to the 2001 Credit Facility.  The Company is currently in compliance with each of the covenants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $318.0 million of debt outstanding under the 2001 Credit Facility, which consisted of approximately $277.0 of term debt and $41.0 million of revolving debt.  The 2001 Credit Facility required the Company to reduce the outstanding principal amount of its 3% Notes to $10.0 million or less by December 1, 2005.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Company is currently in compliance with the covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility, its performance and events beyond the Company's control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect its ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility.  The Company might not meet these covenants, and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet these covenants.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility and under the other debt agreements.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit Facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.  The 2001 Credit Facility is also subject to termination in certain cases</P>

As of December 31, 2004, Industrier had 53.7% of the voting power of the Company's common stock.  Therefore, Industrier has significant influence and control over the Company's business and is presently entitled to elect two-thirds of the members of its board of directors.  Einar W.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Failure of the Company to adequately address the material weaknesses in its internal financial controls could lead to an inability to report on the financial status of the Company on a timely and accurate basis.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has identified the following three material weaknesses in its internal financial controls: (i) ineffective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts at the Company's USG business (ii) ineffective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax accounts, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes payable and income tax expense and (iii) ineffective internal controls over the determination of proper segment disclosure which resulted in the restatement of the Company's unaudited financial statements for the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 to disaggregate segment footnote disclosures for USG and BP in its financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2004. In addition, management has identified, and is developing remediation plans to address, certain significant deficiencies and other control deficiencies which were not material weaknesses. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If actions to remediate these material weaknesses are not successfully implemented or if other material weaknesses are identified in the future (including any of the control deficiencies referred to in the last sentence of the previous paragraph), the Company's ability to report on the financial status of the Company on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent restatements of the Company's financial statements and certain matters related to internal controls may present a risk of future restatements and non-compliance with certain aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During the third quarter of 2000, the Company revised its financial statements for the four quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2000. The revisions resulted from invoices in Brazil that were either not supported by underlying transactions or for which the recorded sales were inconsistent with underlying transactions. In November 2001, the Company announced the completion of a revision of its financial statements for 1998, 1999, 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001. This revision resulted predominantly from a required modification in recognizing revenue for specific customer orders in the Company's AH business in 1998, 1999 and 2000 from the time the order was segregated in a third party warehouse and billed, to a subsequent period when the order was shipped from the third party warehouse to the customer. During the first quarter of 2004, as a result of a newly established internal review process, the Company revised its financial statements related to the accrual of produ
ct discounts in the Netherlands and the treatment of the Company's former French human pharmaceutical business as a discontinued operation. In May 2004, the Company revised its 2003 financial statements to adjust previously reported inventory balances and cost of sales related to product purchased under a vendor supply contract.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In February 2005, the Company announced that it will revise its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 to disaggregate USG and BP as separate business segments.  The Company has also determined that, as of December 31, 2004, there are control deficiencies with respect to customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts in USG and with respect to certain income tax accounts (See Item 9A).   The Company has designated each of these three matters as a material weakness in its financial controls.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has undergone a comprehensive effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance was required as of December 31, 2004. This effort included documenting and testing the Company's internal controls. As of December 31, 2004, the Company identified the material weaknesses described above and, as a result, the Company's management concluded that: (i) the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2004 and (ii) the Company did not maintain effective control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In future years, there are no assurances that the Company will not have material weaknesses (either those referred to above or additional material weaknesses) that would be required to be reported or that the Company will be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404. A significant material weakness or the failure to meet the requirements of Section 404 could result in an adverse reaction in the finan
cial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements. This loss of confidence could cause a decline in the market price of the Company's stock.</P>

</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;During 2001, the Company received a substantial notice of inspection observations ("483 Report") from the FDA at its USG facility in Baltimore.  The 483 Report recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.   This inspection resulted in an assertion by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has received monthly updates on the plant's progress against its corrective action plan and has continued to monitor the program. The FDA performed another inspection of the Baltimore facility in February of 2004 and issued a 483 Report.  While the number and scope of the comments has declined significantly from the Report received in August
 2002, the FDA continues to focus on the facility's need to complete its corrective action plan.  The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore facility in accordance with the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the FDA. Representatives of the Company and the Baltimore facility met with Baltimore FDA in the fourth quarter of 2004 to discuss progress on the corrective action plan and to clarify expectations and deliverables. The Company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in 2005 at which time the Company will be expected to demonstrate substantial completion of its corrective action.  No assurance can be given as to the outcome of this anticipated inspection.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;Between November 2002 and January 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received an FDA 483 Report in January 2003 that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response in February 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report in December 2003 alleging continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations. Certain product recalls were included in the original corrective action plan and were completed in 2002 and 2003. The Company completed a significant portion of its corrective actions in 2004, with the remainder estimated for completion by December 2006, subject to FDA's final review and satisfaction with the actions taken. During September 2004, the FDA completed a re-inspection of the Eliza
beth facility and issued a 483 Report.  The number and scope of the comments declined significantly.  The Company has submitted its response and is taking action to address the observations.  Prior to the September 2004 inspection, the Company's pending requests for new product approvals involving manufacturing at the Elizabeth plant had been withheld.   As a result of this inspection, the Company became eligible to obtain new product approvals at the Elizabeth site.  In the fourth quarter of 2004 the FDA issued four new ANDA product approvals involving products to be manufactured at the Elizabeth facility.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;The total cost and timing of both the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective action plans are subject to change based upon results of future inspections performed by the respective Baltimore and New Jersey Districts of the FDA.  To assist with the implementation of corrective actions at the Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities, the Company has added significant internal and external personnel (largely quality and laboratory personnel) at both sites.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">      &#9;In October 2004, the FDA conducted a general inspection at the Company's Skoyen, Norway API plant. As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report in October that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.  The Company has responded to the FDA. One of the API products manufactured at the Skoyen facility is included within the scope of the inspection. The effect, if any, of the FDA inspection on the regulatory status of the Skoyen site or the products manufactured at this site will not be known until the FDA reacts to the Company's response to the 483 Report.&#9;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Intellectual Property</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;&nbsp;In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDAs filed under paragraph IV for gabapentin capsules and tablets, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998 with respect to capsules and on December 12, 1999 with respect to tablets, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and to the FDA that its proposed generic gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.   The Company filed a motion for summary judgment in both the tablet and capsule litigations claiming non-infringement with respect to both Pfizer's patents. These motions have been dec
ided in the Company's favor by the District Court.     &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9;During the initial lawsuits regarding gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels. After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under paragraph IV that the Company's proposed gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable. In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this third patent. The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent. This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  No trial date has been set for the gabapentin cases relating to the third patent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;In 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that it has secured eligibility for 180-day market exclusivity on gabapentin 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules.  Exclusivity for this product was triggered in October 2004 for capsules and December 2004 for tablets when Purepac commenced commercial marketing of these gabapentin dosage forms.  Concurrently with the Company's launch of gabapentin capsules and tablets, Pfizer launched its authorized gabapentin generic capsules and tablets.  In April 2004, the Company entered into agreements with Teva which provided for Teva to share a portion of the Company's potential patent litigation risks regarding the launch of gabapentin and permit Teva to launch gabapentin (in addition to Alpharma's ability to launch), within the Company's exclusivity period. The agreement provides for certain payments to the Company (estimated to be $40 million through December 31, 2004) based on Teva's net sales during the exclusivity period. </P
>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Based upon the Company's launch of its gabapentin product prior to a final decision in the Pfizer patent infringement litigation, there is the possibility that the Company may be liable for monetary damages if the Company is ultimately found to infringe the patent.  Such damages could include profits allegedly lost by Pfizer as a result of the Company's entry into the gabapentin market.  An award to Pfizer on the theory of lost profits would be material to the Company, even after considering the value of the Teva risk sharing contained in the above-described April 2004 agreement.     </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On September 15, 2004, Ivax filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA and its gabapentin tablets ANDA. The Company intervened in this matter to protect its interests. On September 17, 2004, the District Court ruled against Ivax's request for final product approval, effectively keeping intact the Company's entitlement to exclusivity on both the gabapentin capsule and tablet products.   On September 21, 2004, Ivax appealed the case.   Before the appeal was decided, on February 10, 2005, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which Ivax agreed to dismiss its litigation. In return, the Company agreed to selectively waive its exclusivity for gabapentin capsules and tablets effective as of March 23, 2005 and April 29, 2005, respectively. As a result, Ivax will be eligible to receive final FDA approval for its gabapentin capsule and tablet products on such dates and, if r
eceived, will subsequently be permitted to enter into the gabapentin capsule and tablet markets on those dates, prior to the lapse of the Company's first-to-file exclusivity period.  Until the Company's selective waivers become effective, however, Ivax shall continue to be prohibited from marketing its gabapentin capsule and tablet products. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;From time to time, the Company has engaged in other "at-risk" launches, similar to the gabapentin launch, where the Company has not at present been, but may be sued by the brand name drug manufacturer company for alleged patent infringement. In the United States and in certain other countries, such lawsuits could seek lost profit damages which, if recovered, could be material to the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;In June 2003, the Company received a request for certain information from the United Kingdom Office of Serious Fraud.  The Serious Fraud Office ("SFO") requested documents related to the Company's dealings with several of its competitors with respect to activities in certain specified antibiotic drugs during the late 1990s.  The Company has responded to this request.  The Company has been informed by the SFO that it has initiated a criminal investigation of possible violation of laws by the Company and two of its former UK executives.  If the Company is found guilty it could be subject to a fine in an amount not limited by statute.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 2004 many state and local jurisdictions began investigations of or commenced litigation against pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors growing out of pharmaceutical pricing practices that allegedly defrauded governmental pharmaceutical reimbursement programs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company was named as a defendant in three such litigations in 2004 in Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York City.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In Massachusetts the Company is one of thirteen manufacturers named in a suit brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General in the District Court of Massachusetts.  The litigation alleges improprieties by the defendants with respect to pricing practices for certain drugs from 1994 through 2003, for which the Massachusetts Medicaid program provided reimbursement.  Massachusetts is seeking statutory and civil penalties, including disgorgement of profits and treble damages from each defendant as may be determined at trial.  The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in early 2004 and disposition is pending.  In Kentucky, the Company and its Purepac subsidiary are two of 41 defendant manufacturers alleged to have engaged in fraudulent promotional marketing and sales practices resulting in inflated prices for certain of their respective products in Kentucky, thereby defrauding the state Medicaid program that paid reimbursements on these drugs.  Defendants' answers to the Complaint were 
submitted in February 2005.  In New York City the Company is one of 50 defendants in this action brought by the City of New York alleging that fraudulent Average Wholesale Pricing practices caused the New York State Medicaid program to reimburse drug purchasers at higher than appropriate prices.  Procedurally this case is pending inclusion in the Multi-District Litigation being heard in Boston.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition, in 2004, the Company also received notifications of investigation into pricing issues and practices from the State of Nevada, and the State of Florida.  The Company is currently complying with these requests.  In early 2005, the Company was named as one of many defendants in four more pricing litigations brought by Eire County, NY, Rockland County, NY, Westchester County, NY and the State of Alabama. The Rockland, NY and Westchester, NY complaints are very similar. The Company is one of 49 defendants in both suits, and they both allege fraudulent and misleading schemes that overcharge the Medicaid program for certain prescription drug products. In the Alabama complaint, the Company is one of 79 named defendants and the allegations include improprieties with respect to pricing practices for certain drug products. The Company is in the process of reviewing and responding to the Complaints in each litigation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The State of Illinois, Chenango County, NY, and Onondaga County, NY have named the Company in lawsuits but at the time of this report, the Company has not received service of process. The Company will review and respond to each Complaint in each litigation it receives. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &#9;The Federal Trade Commission, in conjunction with various State Attorneys General, completed a formal investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding a 1998 agreement with Perrigo Inc. under which the Company inter alia: (i) renounced its 180 day Hatch-Waxman marketing exclusivity for a certain product and (ii) granted a license under a patent related to the product in return for royalty payments from Perrigo.  In 2004, the Company entered into a settlement with the FTC and the States whereby the Company agreed to pay $2.5 million to the FTC and $0.75 million to the States. Five private lawsuits alleging antitrust, unfair competition and restraint of trade have been filed against the Company in connection with this matter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chicken Litter Litigation</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">      &#9;The Company has been named in a lawsuit which alleges that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce manure that contains arsenic.  The suit further alleges that the chicken litter, when used as agricultural fertilizer by chicken farmers, causes a variety of diseases in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields).  The Company has filed a claim with its insurance carrier and the carrier has responded by reserving its rights to later reject such claim.  In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the plaintiffs, there is the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in the lawsuit.  The plaintiffs are also requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue.  The Company is in the initial stages of discovery and therefore has not had the opportunity to form a view on the plaintiff's allegations. Worldwide sales of this product were approximately $24.0 million in 2003 and $2
3.3 million in 2004.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    &#9; The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a global generic pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals. The Company offers a comprehensive range of generic human pharmaceutical products in over 800 tablet, capsule, liquid and topical formulations and dosage forms. In addition, the Company manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API's") that are used primarily by third parities in the manufacturing of generic and branded products. It also manufacturers and markets animal health products in over 80 formulations and dosage forms. The Company conducts business in more than 60 countries and has approximately 4,200 employees at over 30 sites, in over 20 countries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Human Pharmaceutical business is composed of API, BP, IG and USG. The API is a worldwide business which manufactures and sells a range of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients which are used by third parties in the production of finished pharmaceutical products.  BP includes the Kadian branded product line. IG is an international generic business primarily in Europe with subsidiaries in Indonesia and China. USG is the U.S. generic business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factors affecting the Human Pharmaceutical business are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic pharmaceutical markets in the U.S. and internationally are extremely competitive and/or regulated by governments which exerts downward pressure on prices. Competition is expected to increase in most generic markets as Indian pharmaceutical companies seek to increase exports and form partnerships with companies in the U.S. and Europe.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market can bring significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. During 2004, the Company launched three new products in the U.S. The number of competitors caused pricing and market share to be significantly lower than expected.  The Company increased research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions. In 2004, the Company filed 10 product applications in the U.S. compared to 4 in 2003. In 2005, the Company plans to file</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> approximately 10 products with the FDA in the U
.S.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with FDA and comparable international agencies' regulations and guidelines is of paramount importance. Significant costs are incurred and opportunities are lost if corrective action efforts in product manufacture are required. The Company has been negatively affected by corrective action costs in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company will continue to spend significant amounts, both internal and external, on corrective actions in 2005.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branded and API products offer profitable growth opportunities as uniqueness and marketing efforts can maintain or increase pricing and increase demand.  Strong profitability and growth opportunities also can encourage additional competition. Pricing was increased substantially on certain API products in 2003.  The Company expects competition in API's in 2005 will cause lower pricing on certain products. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Animal Health business is a global leader in the development, registration, manufacturing and marketing of medicated feed additives ("MFA") for food producing animals including poultry, cattle, and swine.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factors affecting the Animal Health business are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural markets have historically had low growth rates. In addition, demand for company products has been and could continue to be reduced by bans or restrictions on the use of antibiotics and human health risks such as "Mad Cow (BSE)" disease and Asian bird flu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production of API's and MFA's from low cost countries such as India and China has increased competition and lowered pricing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Company business segments also have significant intangible assets and goodwill which require impairment testing and possible write downs based on triggering events which indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable (e.g. increased competition, changes in future plans).  In 2004, the U.S. Generics business determined its goodwill was impaired due to significantly lower expectations for new product profitability and continued intense competition, among other factors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's operations as a whole have been affected by the debt incurred through 2001 to make a number of acquisitions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing in late 2001 and continuing through 2004, Alpharma focused on de-leveraging its balance sheet by converting $212 million of the Company's convertible notes into common stock and reducing additional indebtedness with free cash flow generated through operational efficiencies in the use of working capital and by reducing capital expenditures. 2001 and 2000 were years which included a number of significant transactions which the Company entered into as part of or to finance, its previous acquisition program. No significant acquisitions were planned or completed during 2002, 2003 and 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in 2002 through 2004, the Company incurred significant charges for reorganization, refocus and de-leveraging which were intended to improve future operations and reduce debt and recognize asset impairments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company disaggregated USHP into two reportable segments, USG and BP.  The goodwill resulting from the OPB acquisition was allocated between the segments based on the relative fair value at the time of the disaggregation. As a result of significant price declines and other external factors, the USG segment reforecast its 2005 budget and long term plan, which indicated an impairment of USG's goodwill.  The Company has estimated that the impairment is $260.0 million and has included this amount within operating expenses in the fourth quarter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company adjusted its deferred tax valuation, primarily to set up a full valuation allowance for all U.S. deferred taxes.  This resulted in a charge of $59.5 million.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company purchased the outstanding 50% of Wynco LLC, equity subsidiary and sold the entire company within the first quarter of 2004.</P>

&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2004 the Company prepaid $75.0 million of the 2001 Credit Facility's term loans, $32.0 million of mortgage notes payable in Norwegian Kroner and $24.5 million of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May and August 2004 the Company amended the 2001 credit facility to allow flexibility in complying with the covenants and permit the repayment of the mortgage notes and the convertible subordinated notes.</P>

&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company sold its Aquatic Animal Health Group ("Aquatic") in July of 2004 and recorded a pretax loss of approximately $10.0 million. </P>

&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter, the Company was advised by FDA that the USHP Elizabeth plant was eligible to receive new product approvals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second quarter of 2003, the Company sold $220.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011. The proceeds of the offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were $197.0 million. These proceeds, together with funds available from other sources, were used to repay existing 12.5% Senior Subordinated Notes. The fees paid to the initial purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes of $22.2 million were made pursuant to arrangements originally entered into in December 2001. The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of the existing Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result, both the fees of $22.2 million paid in April 2003 and the unamortized loan costs of $6.2 million associated with the Senior Subordinated Notes were expensed in the second quarter 2003. The effective tax rate in 2003 was 6.5% due primarily to the tax benefit associated with the expensing of the debt placement fees and unamortized loan costs.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2003, the Company closed the sale of its French subsidiary, Alpharma SAS ("SAS") for approximately $6.0 million.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2003 the Company had a program to reduce its workforce which resulted in a charge of $8.7 million and the severing of approximately 175 employees.  Additionally, the Company amended its 2001 credit facility to allow for certain asset sales, permit exclusions for restructuring (including the fourth quarter severance) and refinancing charges from EBITDA and amended certain leverage ratios to delay the timing of more restricted covenant requirements.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the required annual 2002 impairment test, the entire goodwill of Animal Health was written off resulting in a charge of $66.0 million.  New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure resulted in lower forecasted cash flows.  The former strategy of growth through new products, technologies and international market expansion was changed to a strategy to maximize cash generation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the amendment reduced the revolving credit commitment by $150.0 million. The Company repaid term debt of $50.0 million in the fourth quarter which resulted in a charge of $1.0 million pre-tax ($.01 per share). The reduction and repayment resulted in a write-off of deferred debt expense of $3.2 million ($.04 per share).  </P>

</B>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003 and 2004, Metformin ER profit sharing income of $9.1 million and $17.1 million, respectively, is included in USHP segment revenues and operating income and is classified as Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.</P>
<B>
<P>Revenues</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API revenues increased $18.7 million (15.0%) mainly as a result of increased volume of Vancomycin and price increases on other selected products in certain markets partially offset by decreased volumes of these products. Translation of revenues into the U.S. dollar increased API revenues by 2%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues of Branded products declined by $2.9 million reflecting primarily the discontinuation of the Serax product line ($1.5 million). Kadian revenues were approximately the same reflecting a price increase offset by lower volume due to lower wholesaler inventories. During 2004 average weekly scripts increased approximately 28%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IG increased $17.2 million (4.7%) due primarily to translation of sales made in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. Excluding currency impacts, revenues declined 4% reflecting lower revenues in Germany due to volume and the Nordic region and United Kingdom due primarily to price.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USG revenues decreased $0.8 million (0.2%) compared to 2003. Revenues of generic products include approximately $9.1 million and $17.1 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively, earned as a result of an agreement (the "Metformin ER agreement") on the launch of Metformin ER in the fourth quarter of 2003. Such income is recorded as revenues for USHP segment reporting purposes but is reclassified as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the Metformin ER agreement, Alpharma and Ivax agreed to share profits during the 180 day exclusivity period. In return, Alpharma withdrew a lawsuit which challenged Ivax's first to file status on Metformin ER. Revenues of U.S. generic products, excluding the profit sharing revenues, declined by approximately $3.3 million reflecting significant price and volume declines in both liquids, semi-solids and solid oral dose product lines. In the fourth quarter of 2004, USG launched a new product, gabapentin capsules and tablets, and 
recorded revenues of $82.7 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is customary in the industry, USG shipments to wholesale customers include price incentives. These incentives are offered, reflecting the competitive nature of the markets and prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company's inability to supply new products to its wholesale customers as its resolves its FDA issues. The Company monitors its sales to wholesale customers to ensure that wholesale inventory levels are maintained at levels appropriate to satisfy market demand.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories of generic and branded products at certain wholesale customers generally range from 2 to 3 months, although some products exceed the range.  Kadian inventory at wholesale customers is based on expected demand. Inventory levels were reduced in the second half of 2004 as the Company limited incentives offered to wholesalers with the result that sales, except for the gabapentin product, were reduced. The information regarding inventory levels within the channel is derived from inventory management reports obtained at a cost from major wholesalers. This information is critical to estimates of deductions from gross revenues to reported net revenues. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal Health revenues, excluding Wynco and Aquatic revenues, increased $7.7 million (2.7%) compared to 2003 due to the positive impact of foreign exchange (2.3%) and higher volumes in the poultry market, which were offset by price declines due to continued competition and lower volumes in the livestock market.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Company-wide basis gross profit increased $15.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003. As a percentage of sales, overall gross profit was 39.8% as reported in 2004 and 39.9% in 2003.  The overall gross profit percent in 2004, excluding Wynco was 40%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in gross margin dollars results primarily from positive currency effects, increased prices and volumes in API and lower costs and product mix in AHD offset partially by price declines in USGX and IG.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Operating Expenses</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a consolidated basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $38.8 million (11.2%) in 2004 as compared to 2003.  The increase is primarily attributable to translation of foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar $11.9 million (3%), increases in BP's Kadian sales force $10.0 million (3%), costs incurred to comply with Sarbanes/Oxley regulations $6.4 million (2%), Wynco expenses $3.3 million (1%), higher restricted stock amortization $2.7 million (1%), and $1.8 million higher pension costs (1%). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Research and development expenses increased $18.2 million (29%) in 2004 due primarily to planned increases in Human Pharmaceutical spending. This spending has increased in 2004 in order to support an increase in regulatory filings.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Asset Impairments and Other </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2004 asset impairments and other was $29.7 million, and consists of a charge to write down the carrying value of a facility $15.5 million, a $10.0 million charge to write down the carrying value of Aquatic assets to fair value, including an associated pension curtailment loss and other costs associated with the sale and severance charges of $4.2 million. 2004 severance costs were primarily incurred in USG and BP ($2.1 million), IG and API ($1.8 million) and AH ($0.3 million). 2003 had severance charges totaling $8.7 million, primarily incurred in AH.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Goodwill Impairment</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In 2004, the U.S. Generics business determined its goodwill was impaired due to significantly lower expectations for new product profitability and continued intense competition.  As a result, an impairment charge of $260.0 million was recognized in operating income (loss).</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Operating Income (Loss)</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating income decreased by $322.6 million. The Company believes the change in operating income can be approximated as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  The Company has recorded certain U.S. deferred tax assets for which it has provided a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004.  In this assessment, factors such as current and previous U.S. operating losses are given substantially more weight than the outlook for future profitability.  The full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets was determined to be appropriate at December 31, 2004 due to a change in certain available tax planning strategies and continued U.S. losses.  As a result, the Company no longer considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, a full valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2004.  Should it be determined in the future that it is more likely t
han not that these assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be removed against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The tax provision in 2004 was an expense of $61.1 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $253.6 million.  The effective tax rate of (24.1%) results mainly from the $260.0 million write-off of goodwill and the income tax charges of approximately $59.5 million recorded for a valuation allowance for net U.S. deferred tax assets.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue increased $66.5 million (5.4%) in the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002.  Foreign exchange accounted for approximately $59 million of this increase.  In 2002, the Company recorded a net loss of $93.6 million ($1.88 per share) compared to net income of $19.4 million ($.38 per diluted share) in 2003.  2003 results include a pre-tax charge of $28.4 million (0.33 loss per share) for extinguishment of debt related to the April 2003 issuance of Senior Notes due 2011. 2002 results include significant charges and expenses related to the impairment of assets and goodwill in the Animal Health segment, the required acquisition accounting for the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals Business ("OPB"), de-leveraging activities and severance related to reorganization and restructuring.  These charges and expenses lowered pre-tax income by $219.8 million. See 2002 identified transactions.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Revenues</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in API increased $40.9 million (49%) due primarily to price increases in selected products (46%). Foreign currency translation also increased API revenues by approximately 5%. Aggregate volume of all API products was approximately 2% lower.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in BP increased $26.2 million (67%) due primarily to the branded product (Kadian).  Branded sales (primarily Kadian) were $65.3 million in the year 2003 compared to $39.1 million in 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IG increased $48.2 million (15.1%) due primarily to translation of sales made in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar (14.1%). The remaining revenue increase of approximately 1.0% was attributable to higher volume of products (6%) which was substantially offset by price declines (5%), mainly in the United Kingdom and Nordic markets. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in USG declined $9.4 million (2%) due primarily to liquid dose volume declines for the entire year due to Baltimore corrective actions and lower volumes of oral solids partially related to modified release capacity constraints at the solid dose plant in the second quarter of 2003. Revenues of generic products include approximately $9.1 million earned in 2003 as a result of a profit sharing agreement on the launch of Metformin ER in the fourth quarter of 2003. Such income is recorded as revenues for USHP management reporting purposes but is reclassified as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the agreement, Alpharma and Ivax agreed to share profits during the 180 day exclusivity period. In return, Alpharma withdrew a lawsuit which challenged Ivax first to file status on Metformin ER. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories of generic products at certain wholesale customers generally range from 2-6 months for all products, with a majority at the lower end of the range. One major wholesale customer typically holds up to 5 months of inventory for certain products. Kadian inventory at certain wholesale customers is estimated to be approximately 4-5 months based on expected demand. These inventory levels have remained consistent. However, in the event that customers reduce inventory levels in the future, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal Health revenues declined $26.2 million (8.1%) due to volume declines (6%) and price reductions (5%) due to competition, primarily in swine and cattle markets.  Foreign currency translation positively impacted Animal Health revenues by 3%.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Company-wide basis gross profit decreased $8.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002. As a percentage of sales, overall gross profit was 39.9% in 2003, versus 42.7% in 2002. Included in 2002 is a reduction in margin of $5.3 million due to purchase accounting adjustments for the OPB and $1.4 million related to the AH product impairment. Included in 2003 are inventory write-offs of approximately $7.2 million for discontinued liquid products and approximately $18 million of outside consulting expenses resulting from the corrective action plan at the USHP plants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's corrective action plan for the Baltimore plant, provided in response to the FDA inspection observation ("Form 483") was submitted to the FDA in October 2002. In 2003, approximately $21.0 million (of which $12.9 million was for external resources) was spent on corrective actions. In January 2004 the FDA re-inspected Baltimore and issued a Form 483 with significantly less observations than in the 2002 inspection. The corrective action plan in Baltimore will require additional compliance expenditures in 2004 of approximately $5.3 million. The Company expects to be substantially complete with the Baltimore corrective action plan by the end of 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's corrective action plan for the Elizabeth plant provided in response to a Form 483 received in January 2003 required expenditures of $13.3 million (of which $5.2 million was for external resources). In December 2003, the FDA issued a Form 483 and the Company has responded with a plan which will require approximately $2.0 million of external expenditures. The corrective actions are expected to be substantially complete by mid 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in gross margin dollars results primarily from price increases in API, higher USHP brand revenues, and positive currency effects in IG, partially offset by volume reductions, inventory write-offs and corrective action costs incurred by USHP and lower IG and AH pricing.</P>

The increase is primarily attributable to translation of foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar.  In addition, other increases include higher USHP marketing costs for branded products, and increased corporate costs for professional fees and consulting. 2003 includes the reduction of AH operating expenses by $2.7 million for a business interruption insurance recovery. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses decreased $3.9 million in 2003 due to the timing of clinical studies, mainly by USHP and planned reductions by AH. Remediation efforts by USHP personnel has also lowered R&amp;D by shifting resources to corrective actions. </P>

API operating income increased primarily due to price increases. USG declined due to increased compliance costs and lower generic sales, offset partially by product sharing income.  BP increased as of result of volume, and to a lesser extent, pricing.   Excluding charges in 2002, AH decreased primarily due to lower pricing. Unallocated includes corporate expenses for administration, finance, legal and certain unallocated expenses primarily related to the implementation of a company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System and increased due to higher professional fees and increased amortization of ERP expenses.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs decreased $12.6 million to $63.6 million in 2003 due to decreased debt levels and lower interest rates versus a year ago.  The issuance of 8 5/8% Senior Notes replacing the 12 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes in April 2003 has contributed to lower interest expense.  Amortization of debt issuance costs was approximately $3.9 million and $4.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The write-off of $6.2 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the 8 5/8% Notes contributed to the reduction in amortization. </P>

</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss on extinguishment of debt was $29.1 million in 2003 compared to $52.9 million in 2002. The 2003 loss resulted from the extinguishment of $200 million 12 1/2% notes and the related issuance of $220 million of 8 5/8% notes. The extinguishment resulted in the expensing of $22.2 million in placement fees and $6.2 million of deferred debt expense. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002 the Company incurred approximately $52.9 million of expense for two exchanges of common stock for $110 million of convertible debt and write-off of deferred debt expense due to reductions of credit lines and repayment of debt. (See de-leveraging activities included in 2002 identified transactions.)</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Tax Provision</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax provision in 2003 was a benefit of $0.2 million compared to pre-tax income of $19.3 million. The effective tax rate of 1.0% results mainly from the tax benefit on the $28.4 million expense from debt extinguishment at the incremental U.S. federal and state rate of approximately 39% while using an approximate 24% effective rate for all other income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has recorded certain U.S. deferred tax assets for which it has provided no valuation allowances. These U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as any newly generated deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  If it were considered to be more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets would not be realized, a valuation allowance would be established against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company's assessment of its net U.S. deferred tax assets of $25.9 million at December 31, 2003, based upon certain available tax planning strategies, the Company considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, no valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2003. Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized, a valuation allowance would be required and the Company's operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such determination would be made.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IG incurred asset impairment and other charges of approximately $8.1 million consisting of severance charges of approximately $1.7 million and impairment losses of $6.4 million relating to product lines in Germany which, as part of the 2003 plan process, were determined to be impaired and were written down.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USG incurred charges of approximately $5.4 million in connection with the OPB acquisition on December 12, 2001, which in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001 and the remaining balance of $5.4 million as the inventory was sold in the first quarter of 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH incurred charges of approximately $152.1 million in 2002 in connection with changes in response to and in anticipation of major challenges in the marketplace and in the way the business will be managed in the future. The AH business, which is in low or no growth competitive markets, will be repositioned to enhance working capital management and cash flow. AH management was changed; there were reductions in workforce at closed plant sites; and positions were eliminated in a number of functions, resulting in severance charges of approximately $3.8 million. AH announced the closing of four facilities which resulted in write-downs and exit costs of $45.2 million (consisting of $40.2 million of asset impairments and $5.0 million of cost of sales). AH announced an impairment charge of $37.1 million (including $1.4 million of cost of sales) for certain tangible and intangible assets related to an AH product, Reporcin. New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure
 resulted in lower forecasted cash flows and a change in strategy to cash generation from growth through new products and technologies and through international market expansion. The lower forecasted cash flows triggered an impairment of all AH goodwill totaling $66.0 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate includes severance charges for management reorganization of $1.3 million, $51.1 million of charges related to the exchange of convertible debt in the first quarter of 2002, ($48.0 million), write-off of deferred loan costs due to the reduction of the credit line by $150 million ($3.2 million), and charges resulting from the early extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of inflation on the Company's operations during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was not significant.</P>

<B><U><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. All professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 2004, have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  The Company has chosen to highlight certain policies, which include estimates, that it considers critical to the operations of the business and its consolidated financial statements:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Revenue Recognition</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment.  Certain subsidiaries have terms FOB destination where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery.  In the case of FOB destination, revenue is not recognized until products are received by the customer.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Company's U.S. Generic Pharmaceutical and Branded Pharmaceutical businesses, and to a lesser extent in International Generics, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, price adjustments, discounts, promotional allowances, profit sharing, or other managed-care allowances.  Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for these discounts are reflected in the Statement of Operations as a reduction of net sales.  There were no material changes in estimates associated with aggregate provisions in 2004, 2003 and 2002.  Accruals are reflected on the balance sheet with the reserve balances associated with these deductions from revenue classified either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable or, to the extent that they are due to entities other than customers, as accrued expenses.  The reserve balances relative to these provisions included in "Accounts receivable, net" and "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $116.2 million and $63.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $64.7 million and $82.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003.  The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these deductions from revenue by comparison of estimated amounts to actual experience.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in USG and BP for rebates, chargebacks, discounts, promotional and Medicaid allowances and other credits are considered by the Company as different means to reflect price reductions to customers, both direct and indirect.  Included within the above provisions are accrual balances for price reductions at December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $125.9 million and $107.2 million, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in USG and BP for floorstock price adjustments, product returns and profit sharing are generally considered by the Company as reflecting costs of maintaining favorable competitive relationships with the customer.  Included within the above provisions are accrual balances for customer relationships of $39.7 million and $22.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the fourth quarter of 2004, USG launched three new products.  The Company estimated provisions for product returns, price adjustments, chargebacks and other reserves in a similar manner as other products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in International subsidiaries for rebates, chargebacks, returns and other discounts are more diverse and vary by location.  Included within the above provisions are, in total, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, accrual balances of $13.7 million and $17.4 million, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for rebates, discounts, promotional allowances, profit sharing, managed care allowances and other credits are made at the time of sale and are estimated primarily based on contract terms and historical relationship to revenues. Such provisions are determinable due to definitive contract terms and general consistency of historical experience. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for chargebacks, price adjustments and returns require management to make more subjective, and oftentimes complex, judgments.  These provisions are discussed below. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chargebacks - The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.  The Company markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations.  The Company also markets products indirectly to chain pharmacies, independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies, collectively referred to as "indirect customers."  The Company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products.  The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices.  Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers which establish contract pricing for certain products that the wholesalers provide.  Under either arrangement, the Company will provide credit to
 the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler's invoice price.  Such credit is called a chargeback, and the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler's invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate.  The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.  The information regarding inventory levels within the distribution channel is derived from inventory management reports purchased from major wholesale customers.  The Company continually monitors its provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it is believed that actual chargeback rates differ from chargeback rates used to establish reserves.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price Adjustments - Price adjustments, which include shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the Company's products.  Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction.  Decreases in the Company's selling prices are discretionary decisions made to reflect current market conditions.  Amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, estimated declines in market price, and, in the case of shelf stock adjustments, estimates of inventory held by the customer.  The Company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates its reserves and estimates as additional information becomes available.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns - Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows its customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, six months before and twelve months after product expiration.).  The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns.  Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over the counter products, to name a few, and makes adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from established reserves.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has completed several acquisitions since 1998, which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization.  The values assigned to goodwill and intangibles, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by the Company.  In addition, in 2002, upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and reviewed goodwill upon transition and at each year-end for impairment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations. These allocations, including an assessment of estimated useful lives, have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies. Valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset, including historical cash flows.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The year-end 2004 long term USG plan reflected the impact of emerging external factors including the increasing number of competitors, including at times authorized generics, and recent experience with a product launch for which pricing was below raw material costs.  The impact of these factors was significant in valuing the future contribution from future new product launches.  The year-end assessment indicated an impairment of USG's goodwill. The Company has engaged its independent valuation firm to perform the FAS 142 Step II valuation of USG.  Based upon the FAS 142 Step II valuation work performed to date, the Company has recorded an estimated impairment loss of $260.0 million.  </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Asset Impairments</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred, based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset. If the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.  Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the Company, including the determination of an event indicating impairment; the future cash flows to be generated by the asset, including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action; the risk associated with those cash flows; and the Company's cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized. In the case of asset or business divestitures the difficulty of assessing a potential impairment is intensified. The sale of a business or asset is not assured regardless of the intention of the company until an unrelated third party and the Company reach a mutually acceptable agreement. While both parties can genuinely want an agreement, no divestiture is probable until a final agreement has been negotiated and signed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has certain assets not presently fully utilized for production which are expected to be operational in 2005. These under utilized or idle assets also require judgment in determining their probable future cash flows.  At year-end 2004, the Company's plan for a facility changed such that a portion of its value would not be recovered.  This change in plan resulted in an impairment of the facility of $15.5 million. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and Development ("R&amp;D"), Including In-Process R&amp;D ("IPR&amp;D")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to completed acquisitions, acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility, signified by FDA or comparable regulatory body approval, are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits.   Estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&amp;D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Inventories</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventories determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation. The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employee Benefit Plans</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirement, post-employment and health care benefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates, and health care cost and trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Litigation and Contingencies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and also to certain other contingencies (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the financial statements).  The Company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred. Additionally, the Company assesses, in consultation with its counsel, the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis.  Reserves are recorded when the Company, in consultation with counsel, determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset.  In the event the Company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is recorded.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  The Company has recorded certain U.S. deferred tax assets for which it has provided a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004.  In this assessment, factors such as current and previous U.S. operating losses are given substantially more weight than the outlook for future profitability.  The full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets was determined to be appropriate at December 31, 2004 due to a change in certain available tax planning strategies and continued U.S. losses.  As a result, the Company no longer considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, a full valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2004.  Should it be determined in the future that it is more 
likely than not that these assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be removed against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>

</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2004, stockholders' equity was $883.6 million compared to $1,130.7 million and $1,009.9 million at December&nbsp;31, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The ratio of long-term debt to equity was .58:1, .69:1 and .84:1 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in Stockholders' Equity in 2004 results primarily from the goodwill impairment charge and the deferred tax valuation allowance recognized in 2004 results of operations.  At December 31, 2004, due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many other currencies, the Company has other comprehensive income of $161.6 million.  The increase in Stockholders' Equity in 2003 results primarily from the translation of foreign currencies into the U.S. Dollar.  At December 31, 2003, due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against many other currencies, the Company has other comprehensive income of $94.5 million.  At December 31, 2002, th
e Company had an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $12.1 million.   The increase in stockholders' equity in 2002 mainly represents the exchanges of convertible notes to equity and miscellaneous equity issuances totaling $142.7 million and $87.6 million of other comprehensive income primarily due to a positive currency translation adjustment reflecting the weakening in 2002 of the U.S. Dollar, offset by a net loss of $99.7 million, and dividends of $9.2 million.  In 2002, the Company reduced long-term debt by approximately $181.0 million due to exchange of convertible debentures for equity and repayment of $86.0 million of long-term debt, principally with funds from operating cash flow.  In 2003, long-term debt was reduced by $65.0 million due to repayments from operating cash flow.  In 2004, long-term debt was reduced by $122.0 million due to repayments from operating cash flow. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital at December 31, 2004, was $135.0 million compared to $334.8 million and $292.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. The current ratio was 1.25:1 at December&nbsp;31, 2004 compared to 1.93:1 and 1.77:1 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The decline in working capital and the current ratio in 2004 is mainly the result of the classification of $143.9 million of the 2006 Convertible debentures as a current liability.  The debentures must be reduced to $10 million by December 1, 2005 to remain in compliance with the 2001 Credit Facility.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flow from operations in 2004 was $186.2 million compared to $155.1 million and $162.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2004 cash flows reflect net losses of $(314.7) million, offset entirely by non-cash expenses for goodwill impairment of $260.0 million and depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $103.0 million. Better working capital management, the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance (non-cash) and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2004. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002.  Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges.  In 2004, accounts receivable balances decreased $25.9 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2003. 
 Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide.  This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance sheet amounts increased as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 2003 in U.S. Dollars as the functional currencies of the Company's principal foreign subsidiaries, the Norwegian Kroner, Danish Krone, the Euro, and British Pound, appreciated versus the U.S. Dollar by approximately 10%, 8%, 8% and 8%, respectively. These increases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios. The approximate increase due to currency translation of selected captions was: accounts receivable $6.4 million, inventories $10.2 million, accounts payable and accrued expenses $7.8 million, and total stockholder's equity $67.7 million. The $67.7 million increase in stockholder's equity is included in other comprehensive income for the year and results from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in 2004 against all major functional currencies of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, the Company's capital expenditures, including expenditures for purchased dossiers, were $51.1 million.  Capital expenditures relate to a number of capital projects, including the construction of an additional API capacity in Copenhagen. In 2005, the Company plans to spend up to approximately $60.0 million, primarily related to FDA compliance and Scientific Affairs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2004, the Company had $105.2 million in cash and available short-term lines of credit of approximately $1.8 million and $106.0 million available under its 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the Company's short-term and long-term debt is at variable interest rates. The 2001 Credit Facility required the Company to enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on 50% of its debt. At December 31, 2004, the Company has no outstanding interest rate agreement to fix interest rates of its variable rate debt as it has over 50% of its debt at fixed rates. The Company's policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001 the Company completed the acquisition of the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals Business ("OPB") and entered into a $900 million credit facility ("2001 Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement.  The 2001 Credit Facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and pa
yable.  The calculation of EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests. These covenants have been amended from time to time, including amendments made in May and August, 2004 and March 2005.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued compliance with these financial covenants in 2005 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement, and therefore the Company's ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income, or on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt. Since December 2001, the Company has reduced the amount of its outstanding debt and the size of the original facility by prepaying term debt by $260.0 million and by lowering the revolving line of credit by $150.0 million.  On an overall basis, senior debt and total debt at December 31, 2004 were $538.1 million and $701.7 million, respectively, compared to $635.6 million and $817.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Included in senior debt at December 31, 2003, was $220.0 million of Senior Notes, which replaced debt previously classified as Senior Subordinated Notes (see Note 13 for further details). </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Company's EBITDA, as defined, is affected most directly by changes in operating income.  The definition of EBITDA allows for the add back of non-cash charges, including goodwill impairment.  Operating income in 2004 has been negatively affected by business conditions in USG and by corrective actions related to the Company's response to FDA Form 483s issued for the Company's U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals plants in Baltimore (liquids) and Elizabeth (solid dose).  The corrective action plans have included consulting and other costs and have resulted in lower production and significant rationalization of the liquids product line at the Baltimore plant and production delays and interruptions at the Elizabeth plant.  </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA completed an inspection of the Company's Elizabeth solid dose site in December 2003 and advised the Company that, as a result of this inspection, product approvals relating to the Elizabeth site would be withheld pending a successful follow-up inspection.  Major elements of the FDA compliance enhancement plan have been completed.  The Company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in 2005.  In September 2004, the FDA inspected Elizabeth and has since advised the Company it is eligible for new product approvals.  Since the September inspection, the Company has received four new product approvals.  In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company launched both its gabapentin capsules and tablets for the Elizabeth site. The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore facility in accordance with the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates 
to the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by the end of 2004, subject to the FDA's final review and satisfaction with the actions taken.  Representatives of the Company and the Baltimore facility met with Baltimore FDA in the fourth quarter of 2004 to discuss progress on the corrective action plan and to clarify expectations and deliverables. The Company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in early 2005.  While the Company has received no indications from the FDA, the total cost and timing of both the Elizabeth and Baltimore corrective action plans are subject to change based upon results of future inspections performed by the respective Baltimore and New Jersey Districts of the FDA.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to increase flexibility in complying with its financial covenants, the Company received an amendment to its 2001 Credit Facility in March 2005, which provides at March 31, 2005, the interest coverage ratio will increase from 3.00:1.00 to 3.25:1.00 and at March 31, 2006, the interest coverage ratio will increase from 3.25:1.00 to 3.50:1.00 and remain thereafter.  The amendment also increased the permitted leverage ratio from 4.00:1:00 to 4.25:1.00 through and including December 31, 2004. At March 31, 2005, the permitted leverage ratio will decrease from 4.25:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 and at March 31, 2006, the permitted leverage ratio will decrease from 4.00:1.00 to 3.50:1.00 and remain thereafter. In addition, the amendment allows $30.0 million of cash restructuring expenses incurred from July 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, to be excluded from the calculation of EBITDA. Regarding the net worth covenant, the amendment allows up to $250.0 million of asset

&#9;Use of cash in international locations will be made available to fund U.S. investments under the Act.  As of December 31, 2004, Alpharma management had not decided whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings under the Act.  Since that time, the U.S. Treasury has issued guidance, which appears to clarify a number of the Act's provisions, and the Company has now determined that it will repatriate approximately $135 million of cash in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the Act, during 2005.  The tax impact of repatriating this $135 million is approximately $9 million.  Alpharma may adopt additional reinvestment plans under the Act that could increase the amount to be repatriated under the Act by up to $300 million (subject to Board of Director approval) depending upon a number of factors, including the amount of foreign earnings and profits generated through 2005, but is subject to further U.S. Treasury guidance.  The tax impact of repatriating this $300 million would be approximat

In the second quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased a portion of its 5.75% convertible debt to reduce the amount outstanding to the level required to maintain compliance with its loan covenants.  The Company's loan covenants also required that amounts outstanding of the 6.875% convertible debt ($153.9 million at December 31, 2004) be reduced to $10.0 million or less by December 1, 2005.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

<B>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in U.S. Dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies.  The Company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations.  The Company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency.  Such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>At December 31, 2004, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in Euros, Danish Krones, Norwegian Krones, British Pounds, Hungarian Forint and U.S. Dollars with a notional amount of $255.8 million.  The fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material.  All contracts expire in the first quarter of 2005.  The cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non-functional currency transactions.  The change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than $12.8 million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable.  Such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes.</P>

(b)&#9;Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company,</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the Company, and </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.         </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, utilizing the criteria described in  "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").  The objective of this assessment is to determine whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  In our assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, we identified the following internal control deficiencies.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy or the review and monitoring of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts affecting a number of accounts at our USG business, including revenues, accounts receivables and accrued expenses, were not maintained at December 31, 2004.  This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements.  In addition, effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax account balances, including the determination of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, and income tax expense, were not maintained at December 31, 2004 and we did not have effective controls in place to ensure that the Company's income tax accounts were periodically reconciled to supporting documentation.  This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements.  Further, the Company did not have effective controls over the det
ermination of proper segment disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Specifically, as a result of a first quarter 2004 change in its internal reporting of financial information, the Company should have provided disaggregated segment disclosures for U.S. Generics and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals in its financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2004.  This control deficiency resulted in the Company restating its interim financial statements for 2004 to correct its segment disclosures.  This control deficiency also resulted in an audit adjustment to the Company's year end 2004 financial statement segment disclosures and impacted the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004.  These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement in the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Therefore, manageme
nt has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute three material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.  <B> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the material weaknesses described above, the Company's management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the COSO.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and which expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">       To remediate the material weakness related to customer discount reserves and certain accrued liability accounts described above, increased focus will be placed on timely review, documentation, and evaluation of related account balances.  In addition, the Company has implemented new accounts receivable software in the first quarter of 2005, which has automated the processing of customer remittances to allow for more timely resolution of differences. The new software will automate the matching of customer deductions with outstanding credits and improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of processing customer deductions. The Company is also recruiting an additional accounting manager who will be primarily dedicated to overseeing the controls related to the accounting for discounts to customers and customer related accrued liabilities.  To address the deficiency related to income taxes described above, the Company has reviewed its control policies for income tax accounting and 
reemphasized the need for appropriate documentation to support management's financial statement assertions regarding income taxes.  In 2004, the company retained an independent public accounting firm to assist the Company in reviewing its international income tax accounts and tax provisions. In 2005, the Company will expand the scope of their services.  To address the deficiency related to segment disclosure, the Company will institute a more robust review process of disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition, management is developing remediation plans to address certain other control deficiencies which were not material weaknesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Management has discussed the material weaknesses and corrective actions with the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee.  Currently, the Company is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, other than as described above. &#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other than the retention of an accounting firm to assist in the review of international tax accounts in the fourth quarter of 2004, there have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  As described above under Remediation Plan, the Company initiated changes to its internal control over financial reporting as part of its steps to remediate the identified control deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting it considered to be material weaknesses.</P>

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is 
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have completed an integrated audit of Alpharma Inc.'s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consolidated financial statements</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index on page F-1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alpharma Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence sup
porting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Internal control over financial reporting</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, we have audited management's assessment, included in Management's Report on  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that Alpharma Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, because the Company did not maintain effective controls: (i)  to ensure the completeness and accuracy of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts at their USG business; (ii) to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax accounts, including deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, and income tax expense, and (iii) to ensure that proper segment disclosure under generally accepted accounting principles was made in the consolidated statements, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control - Integrated Framework</I> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
 over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment.  Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy or the review and monitoring of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts affecting a number of accounts at the Company's USG business, including revenues, accounts receivables and accrued expenses, were not maintained at December 31, 2004.  This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements.  In addition, effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax account balances, including the determination of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, and income tax expense, were not ma
intained by the Company at December 31, 2004 and the Company did not have effective controls in place to ensure that the Company's income tax accounts were periodically reconciled to supporting documentation</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3 COLOR="#ff0000">.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements.  Further, the Company did not have effective controls over the determination of proper segment disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Specifically, as a result of a first quarter 2004 change in its internal reporting of financial information, the Company should have provided disaggregated segment disclosures for U.S. Generics and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals in its financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2004.  This control deficiency resulted in the Company restating its interim financial statements for 2004 to correct its segment disclosures.  This c
ontrol deficiency also resulted in an audit adjustment to the Company's year end 2004 financial statement segment disclosures and impacted the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004.  These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement in the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.<B> </B>Therefore, management has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute three material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the December 31, 2004 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, management's assessment that Alpharma Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control - Integrated Framework</I> issued by the COSO.  Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Alpharma Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control - Integrated Framework</I> issued by the COSO.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API's principal products are bulk pharmaceutical antibiotics sold to the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and worldwide for use as active substances in a number of finished pharmaceuticals. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, the former U.S. Human Pharmaceutical ("USHP") segment was reorganized into two segments as the CEO and Board were provided with disaggregated operating results of USG and BP.

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</U>:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><BR>
Principles of consolidation:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentations.</P>
<P><BR>
Use of estimates:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Cash equivalents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. Included within cash and cash equivalents is approximately $2,000 of amounts that are legally restricted as to use.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable.  The allowance is based on historical write-off experience, current economic conditions and a review of individual accounts.  Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility.  A specific reserve for individual accounts is recorded when the Company becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position.  If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted.  Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.  There is no off-balance-sheet credit exposure r
elated to our customers.  </P>
<P><BR>
Inventories:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable is written down to its net realizable value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation.  The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the cost of the inventory will not be recoverable based on other factors.  See Note 18 for additional information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Property, plant and equipment:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.  When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss included in net income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciable assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. A loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the assets. Fair value is determined based upon a market quote, if available, or is based on valuation techniques.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest is capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of major construction and software development projects.  In 2004, 2003, and 2002; $405, $167, and $1,904 of interest costs were capitalized, respectively.</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives which are generally as follows:</P>

<P>Goodwill and Intangible Assets:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 142 applies to all goodwill and intangibles acquired in a business combination. Under SFAS 142, all goodwill and certain intangibles determined to have indefinite lives will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets other than goodwill will be amortized over their useful lives, generally 5-20 years, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  See Note 12 for additional detail relating to the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Foreign currency translation and transactions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations are translated using average rates in effect during the year.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in income.  Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment for 2004, 2003, and 2002 is net of $(76), $(1,358), and $(1,910) respectively, representing the tax effects associated with long-term intercompany advances to foreign subsidiaries and other liabilities.</P>
<P><BR>
Derivative Instruments:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and its corresponding amendments under SFAS No. 138, (referred to hereafter as "SFAS 133"), on January 1, 2001. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized periodically in earnings or stockholders' equity, depending on the intended use of the derivative and whether the derivative is classified as a hedging instrument. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedging relationships. All cash flow hedges are linked directly to specific transactions and the Company assesses effectiveness at inception and on a quarterly basis. When it is determined that a derivative instrument is not highly effective, the transaction is terminated or the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's derivative instruments, which are entered into on a limited basis, consist principally of forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. These instruments are entered into in order to manage exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company carries its derivative instruments at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts in current period earnings and changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps, which are classified as cash flow hedges, in stockholders' equity. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company selectively enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell certain cash flows in non-functional currencies and to hedge certain firm commitments due in foreign currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts, other than hedges of firm commitments, are accounted for as foreign currency transactions and gains or losses are included in income. Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction when it is completed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Revenue Recognition:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment.  Certain subsidiaries have terms of FOB destination where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery.  In the case of FOB destination, revenue is not recognized until products are received by the customer.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Company's U.S. Human Pharmaceutical businesses, and to a lesser extent in International Generics, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, or other managed-care reserves.  Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. The Company estimates these rebates, chargebacks, managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience. The reserve balances relative to these provisions included in "Accounts receivable, net" and "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaled $116,249 and $63,010, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and $64,701 and $82,387, respectively, at December 31, 2003. The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reduction
s by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in Other income is $17,142 in 2004 and $9,081 in 2003 of income earned during the 180 day exclusivity period for Metformin ER under a profit sharing agreement with another pharmaceutical company.  The income has no direct costs associated with it although it is supported by and originated from the cost structure and investments of the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income taxes:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities between amounts recorded for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method.  A valuation allowance is established, as needed, to reduce net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2004, the Company's share of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, (excluding cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments), was approximately $241,000. No provisions are made for U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of earnings which have been reinvested abroad or are expected to be returned in tax-free distributions. It is the Company's policy to provide for U.S. taxes payable with respect to earnings which the Company plans to repatriate.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     See Note 15 for additional disclosure regarding accumulated income earned outside the U.S. and addition, to valuation reserves.</P>
<P><BR>
Accounting for stock-based compensation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2004, the Company has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 22. The Company applies the intrinsic-value based method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for incentive stock options, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.  Compensation cost for restricted stock is recorded based on the market value on the date of grant.  The fair value of restricted stock is charged to unearned compensation in Stockholders' Equity and amortized to expense over the requisite vesting periods.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accoun
ting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure", to stock-based employee compensation. No tax benefits were attributed to the stock-based employee compensation expense during fiscal 2004 because the Company maintained a valuation allowance on substantially all of the net deferred tax assets.</P>

Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Recent Accounting Pronouncements  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In December 2004, the FASB revised its SFAS No. 123 ("SFAS No. 123R"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The revision establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, particularly transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is to be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period.  The provisions of the revised statement are effective for financial statements issued for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. Under SFAS 123R, the Com
pany must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. The Company is evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. The Company has not yet determined the method of adopti
on or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and it has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 106-2 (FSP 106-2), "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." FSP 106-2 discusses the effect of the Medicare Act and supersedes FSP 106-1. FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the reduction in accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) as an actuarial gain to be amortized into income over the average remaining service period of plan participants. FSP 106-2 was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2004.  The Company implemented the new accounting standard in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company's APBO and net periodic postretirement benefit costs as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 reflect the effect of the Medicare Act.  The implementation of the Medicare Act did not have a material effect on the overall results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 151, "Inventory Costs". Statement 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). ARB 43 previously stated that under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges.  This statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005, with early application permitted.  The Company is currently evalua

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - An Amendment of APB Option No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions" ("SFAS 153"). SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions," and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and application is prospective. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-2"), provides guidance under FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act") on enterprises' income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October&nbsp;22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. The Company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. Accordingly, as provided for in FSP 109-2, the Company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatri

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals Business ("OPB") and entered into a $900,000 credit facility ("2001 Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement.  The 2001 Credit Facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.  The calcu
lation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests. These covenants have been amended from time to time, including amendments made in May and August, 2004 and March 2005. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with these financial covenants in 2005 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement, and therefore the Company's ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income, or on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt. Since December 2001, the Company has reduced the amount of its outstanding debt and the size of the original facility by prepaying term debt of $260,000 and by lowering the revolving line of credit by $150,000.  On an overall basis, senior debt and total debt at December 31, 2004 were $538,065 and $701,735, respectively, compared to $635,603 and $817,156, respectively, at December 31, 2003. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's EBITDA, as defined, is affected most directly by changes in operating income.  The definition of EBITDA allows for the add back of non-cash charges, including goodwill impairment.  Operating income in 2004 has been negatively affected by business conditions in USG and by corrective actions related to the Company's response to FDA Form 483s issued for the Company's U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals plants in Baltimore (liquids) and Elizabeth (solid dose).  The corrective action plans have included consulting and other costs and have resulted in lower production and significant rationalization of the liquids product line at the Baltimore plant and production delays and interruptions at the Elizabeth plant.  </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA completed an inspection of the Company's Elizabeth solid dose site in December 2003 and advised the Company that, as a result of this inspection, product approvals relating to the Elizabeth site would be withheld pending a successful follow-up inspection.  Major elements of the FDA compliance enhancement plan have been completed.  The Company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in 2005.  In September 2004, the FDA inspected Elizabeth and has since advised the Company it is eligible for new product approvals.  Since the September inspection, the Company has received four new product approvals.  In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company launched both its gabapentin capsules and tablets from the Elizabeth site. The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore facility in accordance with the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates
 to the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by the end of 2004, subject to the FDA's final review and satisfaction with the actions taken.  Representatives of the Company and the Baltimore facility met with Baltimore FDA in the fourth quarter of 2004 to discuss progress on the corrective action plan and to clarify expectations and deliverables. The Company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in 2005.  While the Company has received no indications from the FDA, the total cost and timing of both the Elizabeth and Baltimore corrective action plans are subject to change based upon results of future inspections performed by the respective Baltimore and New Jersey Districts of the FDA.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to increase flexibility in complying with its financial covenants, the Company received an amendment to its 2001 Credit Facility in March 2005, which provides at March 31, 2005, the interest coverage ratio requirement will increase from 3.00:1.00 to 3.25:1.00 and at March 31, 2006, the interest coverage ratio requirement will increase from 3.25:1.00 to 3.50:1.00 and remain thereafter.  The amendment also increased the permitted leverage ratio from 4.00:1:00 to 4.25:1.00 through and including December 31, 2004. At March 31, 2005, the permitted leverage ratio will decrease from 4.25:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 and at March 31, 2006, the permitted leverage ratio will decrease from 4.00:1.00 to 3.50:1.00 and remain thereafter. In addition, the amendment allows $30,000 of cash restructuring expenses incurred from July 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, to be excluded from the calculation of EBITDA. Regarding the net worth covenant, the amendment allows up to $250,0

&#9;Use of cash in international locations will be made available to fund U.S. investments under the Act.  As of December 31, 2004, Alpharma management had not decided whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings under the Act.  Since that time, the U.S. Treasury has issued guidance, which appears to clarify a number of the Act's provisions, and the Company has now determined that it will repatriate approximately $135,000 of cash in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the Act, during 2005.  The tax impact of repatriating this $135,000 is approximately $9,000.  Alpharma may adopt additional reinvestment plans under the Act that could increase the amount to be repatriated under the Act by up to $300,000 (subject to Board of Director approval) depending upon a number of factors, including the amount of foreign earnings and profits generated through 2005, but is subject to further U.S. Treasury guidance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2004, all significant long-lived assets were tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets".  As part of the OPB acquisition, the Company acquired a manufacturing plant and office facility in Piscataway, N.J.  The manufacturing capacity required FDA approval prior to its use as a manufacturing plant.  Since the acquisition, the Company has used the facility for warehousing and as office space.  The plan prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 was to use the manufacturing portion of the plant for production of new products.  In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company determined that it was not economically feasible to use the plant for manufacturing.  The portions of the facility specifically constructed for manufacturing and certain items of machinery and equipment were specifically identified as having no future economic benefit and impairment charges totaling $15,512 were recorded by the

The AH business, which is in low or no growth competitive markets, has been repositioned to enhance working capital management and cash flow. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Southern Cross and Reporcin (AH)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1999, AH acquired the business of Southern Cross Biotech, Pty. Ltd. ("Southern Cross") and the exclusive worldwide license for Reporcin, a product which is used to aid in the production of leaner pork meat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the license agreement, additional payments are required as regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets. The Company also was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin to complement the acquired Reporcin manufacturing facility. To meet that requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June 2000 and began to prepare the facility for production of Reporcin. In early 2002, the Company commissioned an independent study to re-evaluate the market potential of Reporcin in the U.S. market. At the same time the Company halted the work to prepare the Terre Haute facility for Reporcin production. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2002, the Company received the results of the independent study on the market viability in the U.S. for Reporcin. The study identified a number of business risks that translated into slower market penetration and lower cash flows than previously forecasted. As a result of the revised expected value of Reporcin in the U.S., the Company decided to sell the Terre Haute facility and wrote-down the facility to its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company incurred an impairment charge related to the building and fixed assets of $16,353 and accrued for certain exit and shut-down costs in the amount of $2,342.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study also caused the Company to reassess the forecasts of future sales of Reporcin in markets where the Company has regulatory approval. The intangible and prepaid royalty balances totaling approximately $21,800 for these markets were compared by market to the undiscounted cash flows. Since impairment was indicated, discounted cash flows were prepared and an impairment charge of $17,023 was recorded. The Company also has re-evaluated the carrying value of the Reporcin manufacturing facility and inventory on hand and wrote-down the inventory to the lower of cost or market, thereby incurring a charge of $1,382.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to investigate alternative methods to service the U.S. market and will continue to market Reporcin in markets where registrations have been received.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Impairment - AH Goodwill</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the required annual 2002 impairment test, the entire goodwill of Animal Health was written-off resulting in a charge of $66,011. (See Note 12) New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure resulted in lower forecasted cash flows.  The former strategy of growth through new products, technologies and international market expansion was changed to a strategy to maximize cash generation.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2002, all significant intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". Due to an increased competitive influence in these marketplaces and continued government regulation, the Company determined intangible assets for specific products for the German and French markets needed to be tested and were determined to be impaired. Impairment charges totaling $13,487 were recorded in the fourth quarter based on results of a probability weighted cash flow assessment or independent market valuation.  Included therein is an intangible asset impairment of $7,008 related to the discontinued operations of the Company's French subsidiary.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2000, the Company's Danish subsidiary sold the patents, trademarks, marketing authorizations, and inventory related to the Elyzol Dental Gel ("EDG") product for cash proceeds of approximately $8,250. Concurrently with this sale, and due to the specialized nature of the manufacturing process for EDG, the Company entered into a Toll Manufacturing Agreement with the purchaser under which the Company would continue to manufacture EDG for the purchaser for a four-year period. The Company was reimbursed for direct manufacturing costs plus an agreed upon amount for overhead and a variable manufacturing profit which declined as production volumes increased. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the relative fair value of the assets sold and the Company's toll manufacturing obligation could not be reliably estimated, the Company deferred, as of July 2000, the entire excess of the cash proceeds over the carrying amount of the assets sold and expenses associated with the sale. The deferral initially amounted to approximately $7,800 and has been amortized over the four year term, through June 2004, of the Toll Manufacturing agreement on a straight-line basis, which management believes approximated amortization using the units of production method. Income from the Transition Service Agreement and the contractual profit under the Toll Manufacturing Agreement has been recognized as services are provided or goods are sold to the purchaser.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately $1,900 of the deferral was recognized as income in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 and the remaining approximate $970 was recognized as income in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004.</P>

There is no gabapentin inventory in the December 31, 2003 balances.  At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2,536 and $12,498, respectively, of gabapentin raw materials, have been reclassified to prepaid expenses and other, as the cost of the raw materials will be recoverable upon receipt of replacement inventory. Upon receipt, the raw materials will be reclassified as inventory. See Note 18 for additional information regarding gabapentin.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed from the last-in first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in first-out (FIFO) method to account for certain of its USG inventories. The method was changed in part to achieve a better matching of revenues and expenses. While a change from the LIFO method to the FIFO methods requires retroactive application to the financial statements, the change was not material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any of the periods presented, as the inventory values computed under the LIFO method approximated the inventory values computed under the FIFO method. The FIFO method, or methods that approximate FIFO, are now used to determine cost for all inventories of the Company.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible assets consist principally of one major intangible asset class, products rights, including regulatory and/or marketing approvals by relevant government authorities. All intangible assets are subject to amortization. Annual intangible asset amortization expense for the years 2005 through 2009 is currently estimated to be approximately $34,400, $32,800, $31,000, $30,100 and $29,400, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifiable intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. In Germany, in 2003, one product important to the Company's German operations, Pentalong, was required to reprove safety and efficacy by November 2004.  The Company has complied with this request, but has not yet received a response to its filing.  If the data is not satisfactory to the government, the Company will be required to re-evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets totaling approximately $19,000. The Company believes, but cannot assure, it will be successful.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the sale of its French subsidiary (see Note 7), the Company allocated goodwill totaling $2,360 to discontinued operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As required in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company performed the required annual test for impairment. The assessment was made in conjunction with the budgeting and long-range planning by each segment. The assessment utilized forecasted cash flows discounted at a rate of 11%. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has disaggregated the former USHP segment into two reportable segments, USG and BP. The goodwill resulting from the OPB acquisition was allocated between the segments based on relative fair values at the time of disaggregation, in the first quarter of 2004.  The Company, with the assistance of an independent valuation firm, performed the Step 1 impairment test in accordance with FAS 142 as of January 1, 2004, and no impairment was indicated. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The year-end 2004 long term USG plan reflected the impact of emerging external factors including the increasing number of competitors, including at times authorized generics, and recent experience with a product launch for which pricing was below raw material costs.  The impact of these factors was significant in valuing the future contribution from future new product launches.  The year-end assessment indicated an impairment of USG's goodwill. The Company has engaged its independent valuation firm to perform the FAS 142 Step II valuation of USG.  Based upon the FAS 142 Step II valuation work performed to date, the Company has recorded an estimated impairment loss of $260,000.  This amount represents the Company's best estimate of the impairment loss and falls within the estimated range of impairment loss of $233,000 to $273,000.  The Company and its independent valuation firm expect to complete the FAS 142 Step II valuation in April 2005. The change in the estimated impairment, if an
y, will be reflected in the results of operations for the quarter ending March 31, 2005.</P>

</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpharma Operating Corporation ("Alpharma Operating Corporation"), and certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement ("2001 Credit Facility") with the Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions that provides up to a maximum of $900,000 of senior credit facilities. The 2001 Credit Facility is collateralized by a pledge by substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  The agreement replaced the prior revolving credit facility, provided the funds required for the acquisition of OPB and related financing costs and increased overall credit availability. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At closing, the 2001 Credit Facility provided for (i) a $300,000 six year revolving credit facility; (ii) a $175,000 six year Term Loan A; and (iii) a $425,000 seven year Term Loan B.  In December 2001, the Company prepaid $65,000 of the Term A and Term B loans resulting in the maximum amount available to be borrowed under the 2001 Credit Facility being reduced to $835,000.  In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company prepaid an additional $75,000, $35,000 and $85,000, respectively of the Term A and Term B loans and recorded an expense for the extinguishment of debt of $1,237, $692 and $1,791.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2002, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to reduce the revolving credit facility to $150,000. As a result of the modification to the revolving debt arrangement, the Company recognized the related portion of unamortized costs in the statement of income in the amount of $3,176.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility has several financial covenants including a total debt to EBITDA ratio, senior debt to EBITDA ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.  In March 2005, an amendment was approved which permitted exclusions from EBITDA of up to $30,000 of cash restructuring charges incurred from July 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, amended and relaxed the interest coverage ratio and total leverage ratio requirements through December 31, 2005 and allowed for up to $250,000 of asset valuation impairments be subtracted from the required amount of net worth . See Note 3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the 2001 Credit Facility the Company is required to have at least 50% of its total indebtedness at a fixed interest rate for an initial period of 3 years. To comply with this requirement, in January 2002, the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap in order to fix the interest rate on $60,000 of its variable rate borrowings under the 2001 credit facility. As a result of an additional reduction in fixed rate indebtedness due to the exchanges of subordinated debt in March 2002 (discussed below), the Company settled this interest rate swap and entered into a standard interest rate swap to effectively fix the interest rate on $100,000 of its variable rate borrowings at a fixed rate of 7.7% from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2004. The Company accounted for this swap as a cash flow hedge, which matured on December 31, 2004. The Company has no other interest rate swaps.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The effective interest rates on the Term A, Term B and revolving credit facility for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 5.6%, 4.3% and 4.6%, respectively.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial covenants, the 2001 Credit Agreement has a number of non-financial covenants. These non-financial covenants include a requirement that control over the Company not be transferred from an entity controlled by E.W. Sissener, the Chairman of the Company, or his family, if as a result or at anytime after such transfer a third party holds shares representing 20% or more of the voting rights in the Company. A. L. Industrier ASA ("ALI"), an entity controlled by Mr. Sissener and his family (and a holding company whose only material business is holding shares of the Company), currently controls the Company by beneficial ownership of all of the Company's Class B shares which carries the right to elect a majority of the Company's directors. The continuation of ALI's control of the Company remains subject to the unilateral actions of ALI.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 24, 2003, the Company sold $220,000 aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8 Senior Notes due 2011. The proceeds of the offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were $197,000. These proceeds, together with funds available from other sources, were used to repay existing 12.5% Senior Subordinated Notes of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The fees paid to the initial purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes of $22,191 were made pursuant to arrangements originally entered into in December 2001. The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of the existing Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result, both the fees of $22,191 paid in April 2003 and the unamortized loan costs of $6,217 associated with the Senior Subordinated Notes, were expensed in the second quarter 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Company is required to register the 8 5/8% Senior Notes with the SEC for public trading.  The registration is not yet effective and therefore the Company is required to pay an additional 1 1/2% interest per annum to the Note holders until registration becomes effective.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2003, in connection with the offering of the 8 5/8% Senior Notes, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility to exclude from the definition of EBITDA costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 8 5/8% Notes, including the placement fee, to permit the 8 5/8% Notes to be an unsecured senior debt obligation of the Company and to change the senior debt to EBITDA covenant to a senior secured debt to EBITDA covenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility's Term A is payable in quarterly installments ranging from $4,089 to $4,770 through 2007.  The Term B is payable in quarterly installments of $580 with balloon payment of $216,471 in 2008.  In the event that more than $10,000 of either the 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 or the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 are outstanding within six months of their due date, the entire remaining balance of the Term A, Term B and the Revolving Credit becomes due and payable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has issued Industrial Development Revenue Bonds in connection with various expansion projects. In 2003, the Company repaid bonds with a $2,500 principal amount previously requiring monthly interest payments at a floating rate approximating the current money market rate on tax-exempt bonds plus agency and other fees (total rate approximately 4.5%). In addition, the Company repaid bonds with a $1,740 principal amount in 2003, with the remaining $1,200 principal amount requiring fixed interest payments of between 6.875% and 7.25%. The remaining balance of $1,200 was repaid on January 2, 2004.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortgage notes payable denominated in Norwegian Kroner (NOK) included amounts issued in connection with the construction and subsequent expansion of a pharmaceutical facility in Lier, Norway. The debt was borrowed in a number of tranches over the construction period and interest was fixed for specified periods based on actual yields of Norgeskreditt publicly traded bonds plus a lending margin of 0.70%. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 5.2% and 7.6%, respectively. Yearly principal payments were approximately $1,300. In May 2004, the Company's Norwegian subsidiary prepaid approximately $32,000 of mortgage notes payable in Norwegian Kroner and recorded a loss of $885 on extinguishment of debt. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2001, in connection with the formal closing of the OPB acquisition, Alpharma Operating Corporation sold $200,000 in principal amount of 12% senior subordinated notes due 2009 to affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and CIBC World Markets Corp.  These notes were repaid on April 24, 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1999, the Company issued $170,000 principal amount of 3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "06 Notes"). The 06 Notes pay cash interest of 3% per annum, calculated on the initial principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2006 at a price of 134.104% of the initial principal amount. The payment of the principal amount of the Notes at maturity (or earlier, if the Notes are redeemed by the Company prior to maturity), together with cash interest paid over the term of the Notes, will yield investors 6.875% per annum. The interest accrued but which will not be paid prior to maturity (3.875% per annum) is reflected as long-term debt in the accounts of the Company. The 06 Notes are redeemable by the Company after June 16, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 06 Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into 31.1429 shares of the Company's Class A Common stock per one thousand dollars of initial principal amount of 06 Notes. This ratio results in an initial conversion price of $32.11 per share. The number of shares into which a 06 Note is convertible will not be adjusted for the accretion of principal or for accrued interest. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2002, the Company completed an exchange of 3,433,104 shares of its Class A Common Stock for a portion of its 06 Notes having an approximate principal value of $53,400.  The exchange resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $26,982 ($16,487 after tax) in the first quarter of 2002 (classified in Other, net).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the 2001 Credit Facility, the Company is required to reduce the 06 Notes balance to $10,000 or less by December 1, 2005. The Company intends to refinance the 06 Notes and/or refinance or renegotiate the 2001 facility prior to December 1, 2005. Since the Company cannot demonstrate the ability to refinance either obligation prior to December 1, 2005, $143,918 of the 06 Notes has been classified as current portion of long-term debt in the Balance Sheet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, the Company issued $125,000 of 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "05 Notes") due 2005. The 05 Notes may be converted into common stock at $28.594 at any time prior to maturity, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company may redeem the 05 Notes, in whole or in part, at a premium plus accrued interest.  Concurrently, A. L. Industrier ASA ("ALI"), the controlling stockholder of the Company, purchased at par for cash $67,850 principal amount of a Convertible Subordinated Note (the "Industrier Note"). The Industrier Note had substantially identical adjustment terms and interest rate as the 05 Notes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, in connection with entering into the 2001 Credit Facility, the Company exchanged 2,372,897 shares of Class B common stock for its 5.75% convertible subordinated note due 2005 (principal value $67,850) pursuant to an agreement entered into with ALI on July 11, 2001. This is the number of shares that ALI was entitled to receive upon conversion of the Industrier Note pursuant to its terms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, the Company completed the exchange of 1,483,761 shares of its Class A Common stock for a portion of its 05 Notes having an approximate principal value of $34,134. The exchange resulted in a non-cash charge of $7,357 ($5,860 after-tax or $0.14 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2002, the Company completed an additional exchange of 3,266,850 shares of its Class A Common Stock for a portion of its 05 Notes having an approximate principal value of $56,600.  The exchange resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $20,980 ($12,819 after tax) in the first quarter of 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 15, 2004, the Company repurchased and retired $24,455 of its 05 Notes. As a result of the purchase, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $673 as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The balance of $9,752 is required to be repaid on April 1, 2005, and is classified as current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  Alpharma has recorded certain U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which it has provided a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004.    In this assessment, factors such as current and previous U.S. operating losses are given substantially more weight than the outlook for future profitability.  The full valuation allowance on the U.S. federal deferred tax assets was determined to be appropriate at December 31, 2004 due to a change in certain available tax planning strategies and continuing domestic losses.  As a result of these changes, the Company no longer considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. federal deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, a full valuation allowance was required at December 31,
 2004.  Should it be determined in the future that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be removed against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company has state loss carryforwards in several states which are available to offset future taxable income.  The company has recognized a deferred tax asset related to these loss carryforwards, and has established a valuation allowance for most of these loss carryforwards.  Based on analysis of current information, which indicated that it is not more likely than not that most of the state losses will be realized, a valuation allowance has been established for $13,904 of these loss carryforwards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Company also has foreign loss carryforwards in various countries (including Germany, Brazil, Luxembourg, France and Hungary) as of December 31, 2004 of approximately $47,298 (tax effected), which are available to offset future taxable income, and have carryforward periods ranging from five years to unlimited.  The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these foreign loss carryforwards.  Based on analysis of current information, which indicated that it is not more likely than not that some of the foreign losses will be realized, a valuation allowance has been established for $25,425 of these loss carryforwards.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>     The following table summarizes the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, and the corresponding valuation allowances, as of December 31, 2004:</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal income tax returns for all years after 1997 are still subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The provisions for unpaid foreign, U.S., federal and state and local income taxes reflected in the consolidated balance sheet are adequate to cover assessments which might result from examinations to be made by the respective tax jurisdictions. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law on October 22, 2004.  The Act provides for a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by allowing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.  The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and, without final U.S. Treasury guidance, there remains uncertainty as to the interpretation of some provisions of the Act.   As of December 31, 2004, Alpharma management had not decided whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings under the Act and, therefore, did not accrue any taxes in 2004.  Since that time, the U.S. Treasury has issued guidance, which appears to clarify a number of the Act's provisions, and the Company has now determined that it will repatriate approximately $135,000 of cash in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the Act, 
during 2005.  The tax impact of repatriating this $135,000 is approximately $9,000.  Alpharma may adopt additional reinvestment plans under the Act that could increase the amount to be repatriated under the Act by up to $300 million (subject to Board of Director approval) depending upon a number of factors, including the amount of foreign earnings and profits generated through 2005, but is subject to further U.S. Treasury guidance.  The tax impact of repatriating this $300,000 would be approximately $20,000. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains two qualified noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its U.S. (domestic) employees: the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan and the frozen Faulding Inc. Pension Plan. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five years compensation during the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Ideally, the Plan's assets will approximate the accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO"). The plan assets are held under two custodians and two investment managers. Plan assets are invested in equities, government securities and bonds. In addition, the Company has unfunded supplemental executive pension plans providing additional benefits to certain employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an unfunded postretirement medical and nominal life insurance plan ("postretirement benefits") covering certain domestic employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993. The plan has not been extended to any additional employees. Retired eligible employees are required to contribute for coverage as if they were active employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postretirement transition obligation as of January 1, 1993 of $1,079 is being amortized over twenty years. The discount rate used in determining the 2004, 2003 and 2002 expense was 6.00%, 6.25% and 6.75%, respectively. The health care cost trend rate was 9% for 2005, declining to 5% for 2009, remaining level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the reported amounts.</P>

These amounts are compared to the current investment management plan, which as of December 31, 2004 had an annualized rate of return of approximately 8.73% since its current investment advisory was hired in June 1995.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002 and 2003, the Company and ALI had an administrative service agreement whereby the Company provides management services to ALI. The agreement provided for payment equal to the direct and indirect cost of providing the services subject to a minimum amount. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company and ALI entered into a new administrative service agreement whereby the Company provides management services and rents space to ALI. The agreement provides for payment of a fixed yearly fee of approximately $146. This agreement was approved by the Company's Audit and Corporate Governance Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the agreement to purchase Alpharma Oslo, ALI retained the ownership of the Sk&oslash;yen manufacturing facility and administrative offices (not including leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment) and leases it to the Company. The Company is required to pay all expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the facility in addition to nominal rent. The lease has an initial 20-year term and is renewable at the then fair rental value at the option of the Company for four consecutive five year terms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company signed a net lease agreement with ALI that provides for the leasing of a parking lot at the Skoyen Facility through an initial term of October 2014 with the possibility of four consecutive five-year renewal terms. The annual rental is 2.4 million Norwegian Kroner. (Approximately $338 at 2004 average exchange rates.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2003, the Company divested its Norwegian vitamin business to Nopal, a subsidiary of ALI, for approximately $3,300. The divestiture was a transaction between companies under common control and accordingly, the gain on the sale was accounted for as a capital transaction net of related taxes ($2,267 net increase to Additional Paid-in Capital). </P>

</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, the Company received a substantial notice of inspection observations ("483 Report") from the FDA at its USG facility in Baltimore.  The 483 Report recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.   This inspection resulted in an assertion by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has received monthly updates on the plant's progress against its corrective action plan and has continued to monitor the program. The FDA performed another inspection of the Baltimore facility in February of 2004 and issued a 483 Report.  While the number and scope of the comments has declined significantly from the Repo
rt received in August 2002, the FDA continues to focus on the facility's need to complete its corrective action plan.  The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore facility in accordance with the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the FDA.    Representatives of the Company and the Baltimore facility met with Baltimore FDA in the fourth quarter of 2004 to discuss progress on the corrective action plan and to clarify expectations and deliverables. The Company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in 2005 at which time the Company will be expected to demonstrate substantial completion of its corrective action.  No assurance can be given as to the outcome of this anticipated inspection.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between November 2002 and January 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received an FDA 483 Report in January 2003 that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response in February 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report in December 2003 alleging continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations. Certain product recalls were included in the original corrective action plan and were completed in 2002 and 2003. The Company completed a significant portion of its corrective actions in 2004, with the remainder estimated for completion by December 2006, subject to FDA's final review and satisfaction with the actions taken. During September 2004, the FDA completed a re-in
spection of the Elizabeth facility and issued a 483 Report.  The number and scope of the comments declined significantly.  The Company has submitted its response and is taking action to address the observations.  Prior to the September 2004 inspection, the Company's pending requests for new product approvals involving manufacturing at the Elizabeth plant had been withheld.   As a result of this inspection, the Company became eligible to obtain new product approvals at the Elizabeth site.  In the fourth quarter of 2004 the FDA issued four new ANDA product approvals involving products to be manufactured at the Elizabeth facility.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost and timing of both the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective action plans are subject to change based upon results of future inspections performed by the respective Baltimore and New Jersey Districts of the FDA.  To assist with the implementation of corrective actions at the Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities, the Company has added significant internal and external personnel (largely quality and laboratory personnel) at both sites.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2004, the FDA conducted a general inspection at the Company's Skoyen, Norway API plant. As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report in October that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.  The Company has responded to the FDA. One of the Company's API products manufactured at the Skoyen facility and is included in the scope of the inspection. The effect, if any, of the FDA inspection on the regulatory status of the Skoyen site or the products manufactured at this site will not be known until the FDA reacts to the Company's response to the 483 Report.&#9;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Intellectual Property</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDAs filed under paragraph IV for gabapentin capsules and tablets, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998 with respect to capsules and on December 12, 1999 with respect to tablets, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and to the FDA that its proposed generic gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.   The Company filed a motion for summary judgment in both the tablet and capsule litigations claiming non-infringement with respect to both Pfizer's patents. These motions have been decided
 in the Company's favor by the District Court.     &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the initial lawsuits regarding gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels. After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under paragraph IV that the Company's proposed gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable. In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this third patent. The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent. This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  No trial date has been set for the gabapentin cases relating to the third patent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that it has secured eligibility for 180-day market exclusivity on gabapentin 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules.  Exclusivity for this product was triggered in October 2004 for capsules and December 2004 for tablets when Purepac commenced commercial marketing of these gabapentin dosage forms.  Concurrently with the Company's launch of gabapentin capsules and tablets, Pfizer launched its authorized gabapentin generic capsules and tablets.  In April 2004, the Company entered into agreements with Teva which provided for Teva to share a portion of the Company's potential patent litigation risks regarding the launch of gabapentin and permit Teva to launch gabapentin (in addition to Alpharma's ability to launch), within the Company's exclusivity period. The agreement provides for certain payments to the Company (estimated to be $40,000) based on Teva's net sales during the exclusivity period. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the Company's launch of its gabapentin product prior to a final decision in the Pfizer patent infringement litigation, there is the possibility that the Company may be liable for monetary damages if the Company is ultimately found to infringe the patent.  Such damages could include profits allegedly lost by Pfizer as a result of the Company's entry into the gabapentin market.  An award to Pfizer on the theory of lost profits would be material to the Company, even after considering the value of the Teva risk sharing contained in the above-described April 2004 agreement.     </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 15, 2004, Ivax filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA and its gabapentin tablets ANDA. The Company intervened in this matter to protect its interests. On September 17, 2004, the District Court ruled against Ivax's request for final product approval, effectively keeping intact the Company's entitlement to exclusivity on both the gabapentin capsule and tablet products.   On September 21, 2004, Ivax appealed the case.  Before the appeal was decided, on February 10, 2005, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which Ivax agreed to dismiss its litigation. In return, the Company agreed to selectively waive its exclusivity for gabapentin capsules and tablets effective as of March 23, 2005 and April 29, 2005, respectively. As a result, Ivax will be eligible to receive final FDA approval for its gabapentin capsule and tablet product
s on such dates and, if received, will subsequently be permitted to enter into the gabapentin capsule and tablet markets on those dates, prior to the lapse of the Company's first-to-file exclusivity period.  Until the Company's selective waivers become effective, however, Ivax shall continue to be prohibited from marketing its gabapentin capsule and tablet products. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the Company has engaged in other "at-risk" launches, similar to the gabapentin launch, where the Company has not at present been, but may be sued by the brand name drug manufacturer company for alleged patent infringement. In the United States and in certain other countries, such lawsuits could seek lost profit damages which, if recovered, could be material to the Company.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements.

</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2003, the Company received a request for certain information from the United Kingdom Office of Serious Fraud.  The Serious Fraud Office ("SFO") requested documents related to the Company's dealings with several of its competitors with respect to activities in certain specified antibiotic drugs during the late 1990s.  The Company has responded to this request.  The Company has been informed by the SFO that it has initiated a criminal investigation of possible violation of laws by the Company and two of its former UK executives.  If the Company is found guilty it could be subject to a fine in an amount not limited by statute.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Medicaid Litigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004 many state and local jurisdictions began investigations of or commenced litigation against pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors growing out of pharmaceutical pricing practices that allegedly defrauded governmental pharmaceutical reimbursement programs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was named as a defendant in three such litigations in 2004 in Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York City.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Massachusetts the Company is one of thirteen manufacturers named in a suit brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General in the District Court of Massachusetts.  The litigation alleges improprieties by the defendants with respect to pricing practices for certain drugs from 1994 through 2003, for which the Massachusetts Medicaid program provided reimbursement.  Massachusetts is seeking statutory and civil penalties, including disgorgement of profits and treble damages from each defendant as may be determined at trial.  The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in early 2004 and disposition is pending.  In Kentucky, the Company and its Purepac subsidiary are two of 41 defendant manufacturers alleged to have engaged in fraudulent promotional marketing and sales practices resulting in inflated prices for certain of their respective products in Kentucky, thereby defrauding the state Medicaid program that paid reimbursements on these drugs.  Defendants' answ
ers to the Complaint were submitted in February 2005.  In New York City the Company is one of 50 defendants in this action brought by the City of New York alleging that fraudulent Average Wholesale Pricing practices caused the New York State Medicaid program to reimburse drug purchasers at higher than appropriate prices.  Procedurally this case is pending inclusion in the Multi-District Litigation being heard in Boston.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in 2004, the Company also received notifications of investigation into pricing issues and practices from the State of Nevada, and the State of Florida.  The Company is currently complying with these requests.  In early 2005, the Company was named as one of many defendants in four more pricing litigations brought by Rockland County, NY, Westchester County, NY and the State of Alabama. The Rockland, NY and Westchester, NY complaints are very similar. The Company is one of 49 defendants in both suits, and they both allege fraudulent and misleading schemes that overcharge the Medicaid program for certain prescription drug products. In the Alabama complaint, the Company is one of 79 named defendants and the allegations include improprieties with respect to pricing practices for certain drug products. The Company is in the process of reviewing and responding to the Complaints in each litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State of Illinois, Chenango County, NY, and Onondaga County, NY have named the Company in lawsuits but at the time of this report, the Company has not received service of process. The Company will review and respond to each Complaint in each litigation it receives. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Perrigo Agreement Litigation</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Trade Commission, in conjunction with various State Attorneys General, completed a formal investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding a 1998 agreement with Perrigo Inc. under which the Company inter alia: (i) renounced its 180 day Hatch-Waxman marketing exclusivity for a certain product and (ii) granted a license under a patent related to the product in return for royalty payments from Perrigo.  In 2004, the Company entered into a settlement with the FTC and the States whereby the Company agreed to pay $2,500 to the FTC and $750,000 to the States. Five private lawsuits alleging antitrust, unfair competition and restraint of trade have been filed against the Company in connection with this matter.  The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages in response to the claims.  The Company is in the process of responding to the claims made in the lawsuits.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">    </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chicken Litter Litigation</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has been named in a lawsuit which alleges that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce manure that contains arsenic.  The suit further alleges that the chicken litter, when used as agricultural fertilizer by chicken farmers, causes a variety of diseases in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields).  The Company has filed a claim with its insurance carrier and the carrier has responded by reserving its rights to later reject such claim.  In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the plaintiffs, there is the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in the lawsuit.  The plaintiffs are also requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue.  The Company is in the initial stages of discovery and therefore has not had the opportunity to form a view on the plaintiff's allegations. Worldwide sales of this product were approximately $24,000 
in 2003 and $23,300 in 2004.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brazilian Tax Claims</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the subject of several tax claims which aggregate approximately $9,500 by the Brazilian authorities relating to the operations of the Company's Animal Health business in Brazil since 1999. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its position against these claims.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Commercial Disputes</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2004, the Company settled outstanding litigation with a contract manufacturer who had supplied product to the Company in prior years and received a $5,300 settlement payment. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Other Litigations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business.  It is the view of management, after consultation with counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all other pending suits on an individual basis should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations of the Company or cash flows of the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with a notional amount of approximately $255,850 and $118,487, respectively. These contracts called for the exchange of Scandinavian and European currencies and in some cases the U.S. Dollar to meet commitments in or sell cash flows generated in non-functional currencies. All outstanding contracts will expire in 2005 and the unrealized gains and losses are not material.  The Company does not account for these transactions as hedges under SFAS 133. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counterparties to derivative agreements are major financial institutions. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also used interest rate swaps to hedge variable interest rates, in accordance with the requirements of the 2001 Credit Facility. These swaps have matured in 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt other than the subordinated notes approximates fair value because a significant portion of the underlying debt is at variable rates and reprices frequently. The fair value of the 2005 and 2006 subordinated notes is based on the bid price of the notes, which are publicly traded.  The fair value of the 2011 senior notes, which are not publicly traded, have been calculated based on comparable market yields at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows:</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to May 19, 2003, the Company granted options to key employees to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock under the 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan"). The maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Plan was 8,000,000. In addition, the Company had a Non-Employee Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan") which provided for the issue of up to 350,000 shares of Class A Common stock. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan could not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Options granted expired from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options were exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. The Plan permitted a cash appreciation right to be granted to certain employees. Included in options outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2004, are options to purchase 27,550 shares with cash appreciation ri
ghts, 20,500 of which are exercisable. If an option holder ceased to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which were not vested at the date of termination were forfeited. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 19, 2003, the Company's stockholders approved the Alpharma Inc. 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Incentive Compensation Plan").  The Incentive Compensation Plan permits stock option grants, stock appreciation rights grants ("SARs"), annual incentive awards, stock grants, restricted stock grants, restricted stock unit grants, performance stock grants, performance units grants, and cash awards.  Upon adoption of the Incentive Compensation Plan, no additional options were granted under the previously existing plans and all shares reserved under these existing plans were returned to the Company's supply of authorized but unissued shares, not reserved for any purpose, although outstanding options granted pursuant to the previously existing plans will remain outstanding.  Upon adoption, the maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Incentive Compensation Plan was 4,750,000 and the number of shares that were permitted to be issued for Awards ot
her than stock options or SARS (both with a grant price equal to at least fair market value at date of grant), were not to exceed a total of 2,000,000 shares.  Options granted expire from three to ten years after the grant date.  Generally, options are exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant.  If an option holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which are not vested at the date of termination are forfeited.  As of December 31, 2004, 3,577,044 shares are available for future grant under all plans.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>The Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the issuance of performance units that are valued based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return as compared to a market index of peer companies and the satisfaction of a free cash flow threshold. Each performance unit has a potential value between zero and $200.  In 2004, approximately 95,082 performance units were granted under this plan, which may result in cash payments based on performance during a three-year period ending December&nbsp;31, 2006. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", the future outcome of the Company's performance measured against peer companies is undeterminable, and therefore the Company has not established a reserve for potential future costs.  The potential costs would be $4,754 in 2006 if the Company is in the 50<SUP>th</SUP> percentile
 relative to the peer group and potentially up to $19,016 if the Company is in the 90<SUP>th</SUP> percentile relative to the peer group. If the Company had made the computation as of December 31, 2004, the liability would be zero.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan by which eligible employees of the Company may authorize payroll deductions up to 4% of their regular base salary to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at the fair market value. The Company matches these contributions with an additional contribution equal to 50% of the employee's contribution. Shares are issued on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Company's contributions to the plan were approximately $1,500, $1,400, and $1,250 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are included within operating income.</P>

<P>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Information Concerning Business Segments and Geographic Operations:</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2004, the Company had four reportable segments (IG, API, AH and USHP).  As described in Note 1, during 2004, operating results of USHP were disaggregated into USG and BP. Accordingly, the Company now has five reportable segments and prior year information of USHP has been disaggregated into USG and BP. The disaggregation of USHP is based on the manner in which results have been reported internally and does not, in certain instances, reflect arm's length transactions between USG and BP (e.g. BP product is manufactured by USG and transferred at cost).  Each business has a segment manager who reports directly to the CEO.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of each segment are evaluated based on earnings before interest and taxes (operating income).  Unallocated includes corporate expenses for administration, finance, legal and certain unallocated expenses primarily related to the implementation of a company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning System and the amortization of restricted stock. Eliminations include inter-segment sales. Geographic revenues represent sales to third parties by country in which the selling legal entity is domiciled. Operating assets directly attributable to business segments are included in identifiable assets (i.e. sum of accounts receivable, inventories, net property, plant and equipment and net intangible assets). Operating assets for BP do not include manufacturing property, plant and equipment but do include an allocation of goodwill based on relative fair values as of the first quarter of 2004. Cash, prepaid expenses, and other corporate and non-allocated assets are included in unalloca
ted. For geographic reporting, long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment and net intangibles.  Segment data includes immaterial inter-segment revenues. No customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.</P>

In addition such firm orders shall be made only in fixed multiple batch sizes to be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THIS</B> <B>SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT </B>(the "Agreement"), dated as of February 10, 2005, (the "Execution Date") is among: (i) Ivax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Plaintiff") and (ii) Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. ("Purepac") and Alpharma, Inc. ("Alpharma").  Plaintiffs, Purepac and Alpharma may be individually referred to as a "Party", and collectively referred to as the "Parties."</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RECITALS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS,</B> Plaintiff sued the Food and Drug Administration, et al., in a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 1:04cv1603, and Plaintiff appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ("the Court"), Appeal No. 04-5320 ("the Litigation");</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS</B>, Purepac is an affiliate of Alpharma and Purepac is a third-party intervenor- in the Litigation; </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS,</B> Plaintiffs wish to settle the Litigation, Purepac and Alpharma desire that the Litigation be settled, and the Parties have reached an agreement to settle the Litigation, which is set forth in this Settlement Agreement together with Selective Waiver Agreements (attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 and A-2) the Relinquishment (attached hereto as Exhibit B), and an agreed Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal (the "Dismissal   of Appeal")(attached hereto as Exhibit C)(the Settlement Agreements, and the Dismissal of Appeal are collectively referred to as the "Settlement Documents");</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS,</B> the Settlement Documents are the only consideration exchanged by or on behalf of Plaintiffs, on the one side, and Purepac and Alpharma, on the other side, in entering into this Agreement.  Plaintiffs and Purepac and Alpharma have received no consideration for their entry into this settlement other than that which is described in the Settlement Documents; and,</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS</B>, the Settlement Documents constitute both Plaintiff's and Purepac and Alpharma's best independent judgment as to the most convenient, effective and expeditious way to mutually settle all prior, present and future disputes that have arisen or may arise regarding the exclusivity awarded under Purepac's Abbreviated New Drug Applications No. 75-350 and No. 75-694 ("Purepac's ANDAs"): </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in the Settlement Documents, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Court (or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, if more appropriate) solely for the purposes of the settlement of the Litigation and enforcement of the terms of the Settlement Documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court (and, if more appropriate, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) has jurisdiction over the Litigation and the Plaintiff (solely for the purpose of this settlement), and venue is proper in the District of Columbia.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall constitute an admission or acknowledgement that the Food and Drug Administration properly granted marketing exclusivity pursuant to 21 U.S.C Section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "Exclusivity") to Alpharma under Purepac's ANDAs No. 75-350 and 75-694 for gabapentin capsules in 100 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg dosage strengths and gabapentin tablets in 600 mg and 800 mg respectively, based on FDA's so-called "patent based" approach.   </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the Court's entry of the Dismissal of Appeal before the issuance of a decision on the merits in that appeal by that Court and Plaintiff's continued compliance with the terms of the Settlement Documents, Purepac and Alpharma agree that they will waive and not assert its market exclusivity under Purepac's ANDA No. 75-350 for gabapentin capsules against Plaintiff as of March 23, 2005 (the "Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date"). In order to expedite Plaintiff's final FDA approval for gabapentin capsules, and to ensure that such final FDA approval is in place by the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, Purepac and Alpharma agree to execute and file with the FDA the Selective Waiver as set forth in Exhibit A-1 immediately upon the Court's entry of the Dismissal of Appeal.  Such execution and filing of the Selective Waiver prior to the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, however, shall not be deemed as a waiver of Exclusivity by Alpha
rma or Purepac effective prior to the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, and is only being undertaken to ensure that Plaintiff's final FDA marketing approval for gabapentin capsules is in place on the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date so that IVAX can immediately commence gabapentin capsule sales as of the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date. Purepac and Alpharma shall cooperate with Plaintiff in order:  (1) to ensure that the Court promptly enters the Dismissal of Appeal; and (2) for Plaintiff to obtain as promptly as possible final FDA approval of the Plaintiff's gabapentin capsule ANDA and shall refrain from taking any action directly or indirectly that may interfere with or delay the Court's entry of the Dismissal of Appeal or Plaintiff's obtaining such prompt final approval.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the Court's entry of the Dismissal of Appeal before the issuance of a decision on the merits in that appeal by that Court and Plaintiff's continued compliance with the terms of the Settlement Documents, Purepac and Alpharma agree that they will waive and not assert its market exclusivity under Purepac's ANDA No. 75-694 for gabapentin tablets against Plaintiff as of April 29, 2005 (the "Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date").   In order to expedite Plaintiff's final FDA approval for gabapentin tablets, and to ensure that such final FDA approval is in place by the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, Purepac and Alpharma agree to execute and file with the FDA the Selective Waiver as set forth in Exhibit A-2 immediately upon the Court's entry of the Dismissal  of Appeal.  Such execution and filing of the Selective Waiver prior to the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, however, shall not be deemed as a waiver of Exclusivity by Alpharma
 or Purepac effective prior to the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, and is only being undertaken to ensure that Plaintiff's final FDA marketing approval for gabapentin tablets is in place on the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date so that IVAX can immediately commence gabapentin tablet sales as of the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date.  Purepac and Alpharma shall cooperate with Plaintiff in order:(1) to ensure that the Court promptly enters the Dismissal of Appeal; and (2) for Plaintiff to obtain as promptly as possible final FDA approval of the plaintiff's gabapentin tablet ANDA and shall refrain from taking any action that may interfere with or delay the Court's entry of the Dismissal of Appeal or Plaintiff's obtaining such prompt final approval.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff acknowledges that Alpharma and Purepac's filing of the Selective Waivers with the FDA in advance of the applicable Selective Waiver Effective Date is solely for the purpose of enabling Plaintiff to obtain final FDA marketing approval so it can immediately commence gabapentin sales as of the applicable Selective Waiver Effective Date.  Plaintiff covenants that it will not sell gabapentin capsules until the Capsule Selective Waiver Effective Date of March 23, 2005 or gabapentin tablets until the Tablet Selective Waiver Effective Date of April 29, 2005; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Plaintiff from engaging in lawful accepted industry practices prior to the applicable Selective Waiver Effective Dates. In the event that Purepac or Alpharma believe that Plaintiff has breached this Agreement, neither Purepac nor Alpharma shall in any way be entitled to withdraw or revoke either of the Selective Waivers, or to in any way 
interfere with or object to Plaintiff obtaining final approval from FDA as of the applicable Selective Waiver Effective Dates.  Instead, Purepac's and Alpharma's remedy shall be limited to a breach of contract action for money damages, provided it can establish legal entitlement to such relief.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Plaintiff from selling gabapentin capsules or tablets prior to the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date or the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date in the event that Purepac's or Alpharma's Exclusivity expires prior to either of those dates.        </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiff covenants and agrees to indemnify and defend Purepac and Alpharma and its directors, officers, employees, servants and agents (collectively "Alpharma Indemnities") from and against any Damages incurred by any Alpharma Indemnities, and to hold the Alpharma Indemnities harmless as to any damages incurred by Plaintiff, in connection with any and all product liability suits by third parties or patent infringement suits by Pfizer, Inc. or its affiliates relating to U.S. Patent No. 6,054,482 (including related investigations, claims or demands) in each case resulting solely from  Plaintiff's sale of gabapentin capsule and tablet products under ANDA Nos. 75-477 and 76-017, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement does not waive Alpharma's right to assert its market exclusivity against persons or entities other than Plaintiff, or otherwise act as a release, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Selective Waivers or the Relinquishment.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma and Purepac represent, warrant and covenant that, except for those rights previously granted to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. under a selective waiver agreement entered into on April 26, 2004 and thereafter amended on September 24, 2004, October 7, 2004, and the amendment being executed concurrently herewith, and which hereinafter may be amended or modified from time to time, neither Alpharma nor Purepac (i) have granted or assigned to any third party entity or individual, directly or indirectly, any rights under or to Purepac's ANDAs, (ii) will grant or assign to any third party entity or individual, directly or indirectly, any rights under or to Purepac's ANDAs or any waivers of its Exclusivity or (iii) will directly or indirectly enter into any contract or any other transaction with any third party or affiliate that conflicts or derogates from its undertakings hereunder, including, without limitation, the Selective Waivers or the Relinqui
shment.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purepac represents and warrants that it is the holder of Purepac's ANDAs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the Court's entry of the Dismissal of Appeal before the issuance of a decision on the merits in that appeal by that Court and Plaintiff's continued compliance with the terms of the Settlement Documents, Alpharma and Purepac represent and covenant that they will not sue Plaintiffs or any affiliates for violating any Exclusivity resulting from Plaintiffs selling of the drug products approved by the FDA pursuant to the Settlement Documents as may be amended from time to time.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintiffs and Defendants, through their respective attorneys, shall each execute the Dismissal of Appeal as attached hereto as Exhibit C contemporaneously with the execution of this Settlement Agreement and thereafter submit, through their respective attorneys, the fully executed Dismissal of Appeal to the Court on the Execution Date.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Court refuses to enter the Dismissal of Appeal, then the Parties shall in good faith use reasonable commercial efforts to modify, if possible, the Settlement Documents to overcome any objections by the Court, provided that such modifications do not materially change the economic value of the transaction for any such Party.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Party shall submit the Settlement Documents to the Federal Trade Commission ("Commission") pursuant to Section 1112(b) of Title XI of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.  In the event of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (either the Commission or the Antitrust Division being the "Agency") or any other Federal or State agency or governmental office regarding this settlement, the Parties agree to fully cooperate with each other and with the investigating or inquiring agency or office in connection with any such investigation or inquiry.  If the Commission, Agency or other Federal or State agency or office objects to this settlement then the Parties shall otherwise in good faith use reasonable commercial efforts to modify, if possible, the Settlement Documents to overcome any such objections, provided that such modifications do not materially change
 the economic value of the transaction for any such Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such objection prevents the FDA from granting Plaintiff final marketing approval for gabapentin capsules by the Capsule Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date or for gabapentin tablets by the Tablet Exclusivity Waiver Effective Date, then Purepac and Alpharma shall immediately file the Relinquishment as attached hereto as Exhibit B for the applicable product. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Party to this Settlement Agreement represents and warrants that the person executing this Settlement Agreement on its behalf has the power and authority to enter this Settlement Agreement on behalf of that Party.  Alpharma has received all requisite consents from Teva to execute, deliver and perform this Settlement Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement and any claims, disputes or causes of action relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") has established the Alpharma Inc. 2005 Supplemental Savings Plan (the "Plan") effective January 1, 2005.  The Plan is an unfunded arrangement established and maintained by the Company for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Participants are permitted to defer a portion of their Compensation to the Plan after their pre-tax deferrals under the Alpharma Inc. Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan") reach the applicable dollar amount specified under Section 402(g) of the Code for that year. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder and related guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").  </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>
<A NAME="_Toc467396948"><B>ARTICLE I</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DEFINITIONS</A></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever the following words and phrases are used in this Plan, with the first letter capitalized, they shall have the meanings specified below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Account" or "Accounts" shall mean all of such accounts as are established under this Plan from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Base Salary" shall mean a Participant's annual base compensation, excluding bonuses, commissions, incentive and all other remuneration for services rendered to Company and prior to reduction for any salary deferrals, including but not limited to, deferrals under plans established pursuant to Section 125 of the Code or qualified pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beneficiary" or "Beneficiaries" shall mean the person or persons, including a trustee, personal representative or other fiduciary, last designated in writing by a Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Committee to receive the benefits specified hereunder in the event of the Participant's death.  No beneficiary designation shall become effective until it is filed with the Committee.  Any designation shall be revocable at any time through a written instrument filed by the Participant with the Committee with or without the consent of the previous Beneficiary.  In the event that a Participant who designated his or her spouse as Beneficiary under the Plan subsequently becomes divorced or legally separated, then such prior Beneficiary designation shall automatically be deemed revoked as it relates to the spouse (or former spouse), unless it is subsequently ratified in writing by the Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is no such designation, or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, then the Participant's surviving spouse shall be the Beneficiary.  If there is no surviving spouse, the duly appointed and currently acting personal representative of the Participant's estate (which shall include either the Participant's probate estate or living trust) shall be the Beneficiary.  In any case where there is no such personal representative of the Participant's estate duly appointed and acting in that capacity within 90 days after the Participant's death (or such extended period as the Committee determines is reasonably necessary to allow such personal representative to be appointed, but not to exceed 180 days after the Participant's death), then Beneficiary shall mean the person or persons who can verify by affidavit or court order to the satisfaction of the Committee that they are legally entitled to receive the benefits specified hereunder.  In the event any amount is payable under the Plan
 to a minor, payment shall not be made to the minor, but instead be paid (a) to that person's living parent(s) to act as custodian, (b) if that person's parents are then divorced, and one parent is the sole custodial parent, to such custodial parent, to act as custodian, or (c) if no parent of that person is then living, to a custodian selected by the Committee to hold the funds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the jurisdiction in which the minor resides.  If no parent is living and the Committee decides not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, then payment shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor is duly appointed and currently acting within 60 days after the date the amount becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the estate of the minor.  Payment by the Company pursuant to any unrevoked Beneficiar
y designation, or to the Participant's estate if no such designation exists, shall be considered complete satisfaction of all benefits owed under the Plan.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compensation Deferral Election" shall mean an Eligible Employee's election to defer a portion of his or her Compensation during a Plan Year to the Plan. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deferral Account" shall mean the bookkeeping account maintained by or for the Committee for each Participant, which account is credited with amounts equal to (a) the portion of the Participant's Compensation that he or she elects to defer to the Plan pursuant to a Compensation Deferral Election, and (b) earnings and losses pursuant to Section 4.1.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disabled" shall mean a Participant who (a) is unable to<A NAME="jumpdest_409aa2ci"><A NAME="jumpdest_td28212"></A> engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 month</A>s, or (b) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than 3 months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company.

Such Compensation Deferral Election, however, can only relate to Compensation that has not yet been earned.  No later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that the Committee may specify), the Eligible Employee shall also file with the Committee a Payment Election with respect to such deferral of Compensation and related Company Matching Contributions, if any, on a form provided by the Committee.  In the event that an Eligible Employee does not file a Payment Election during the Initial Election Period, the Eligible Employee shall be deemed to have elected a lump sum with respe

The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer is such Compensation to be earned after the time at which the Eligible Employee files with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a).  The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer shall be a percentage of Compensation, which shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Eligible Employee's Compensation, provided that the total amount deferred by a Participant shall be limited in any calendar year, if necessary, to satisfy social security taxes (including Medicare), income taxes and employee benefit plan withholding requirements, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Committee.  </P>

In the case of an employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Effective Da

Such Payment Election shall be for the remainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Event, the Company may at anytime thereafter deliver to the Secretary a certificate executed by the Company attesting to the fact that a Forfeiture Event has occurred and, immediately upon receipt of such certificate, the Secretary is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Employee (without any further action on the part of the Employee) to take all actions necessary or appropriate to deliver the forfeited Shares, endorsed for transfer, to the Company.  <U>By accepting this Agreement as set forth in Section 1(b) above, the Employee hereby appoints the Secretary as the Employee's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, and agent with full power of substitution for him or her in any and all capacities, to assign and transfer such Shares unto the Company, and to execute with respect to such Shares all documents necessary or appropriate to make such securities negotiable and to complete any transaction herein contemplated including, without limi
tation, the filing with any applicable state blue sky authority or any required applications for consent to, or notice of, transfer of the Shares.  The Employee further ratifies and confirms all that said attorney-in-fact may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the occurrence of the Full Vesting Date, (or earlier upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Award pursuant to <U>Section 2(c)</U> above), the Secretary shall promptly, upon written request, deliver to the Employee the certificate or certificates representing such then-vested Shares, and the Secretary shall be discharged of all further obligations hereunder with respect to such Restricted Stock Award.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>.  Neither the Company nor the Secretary shall be liable for any act it may do or omit to do with respect to holding the Restricted Stock Award in escrow hereunder and while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its judgment.  The Secretary is expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person or corporation, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court.  In the event that the Secretary obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree, the Secretary shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.  The Secretary shall not be liabl
e in any respect on account of the identity, authorities or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver the Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.  The Secretary shall be entitled to employ such legal counsel (which may be counsel to the Company) and other experts as it may deem necessary in connection with its obligations hereunder, it may rely upon the advice of such counsel, and it may cause the Company to pay such counsel reasonable compensation therefor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Disputes over Escrow</U>.  It is understood and agreed that should any dispute arise with respect to the delivery and/or ownership or right of possession of any Shares of the Restricted Stock Award held by the Secretary pursuant to <U>Section 4</U> above, the Secretary is authorized and directed to retain in its possession or to deliver into court without liability to anyone, all or any part of said Restricted Stock Award until such disputes shall have been settled either by mutual written agreement of the parties concerned or by a final order, decree or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction after the time for appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected, but the Secretary shall be under no duty whatsoever to institute or defend any such proceedings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Prohibition on Transfer</U>.  The Employee is subject to Section 8.3 of the Plan, which sets forth restrictions on the transferability, sale, pledge, assignment, etc. of the Restricted Stock Award.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Failure to Deliver Granted Shares to be Forfeited</U>.  In the event that Shares to be forfeited to the Company under this Agreement are not in the Secretary's possession pursuant to <U>Section 4</U> above or otherwise and the Employee or the Employee's successor-in-interest fails to deliver such Shares to the Company (or its designee, as the case may be), the Company may elect to immediately take such action as is appropriate to transfer record title of such Shares from the Employee to the Company (or its designee, as the case may be) and to treat the Employee and such Shares in all respects as if delivery of such Shares had been made as required by this Agreement.  The Employee has granted the Company a power of attorney in <U>Section 4(b)</U> above that shall be coupled with an interest for the purpose of effectuating the preceding sentence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Additional Securities</U>.  If the Company shall pay a stock dividend or declare a stock split on or with respect to any of its Class A Common Stock, or otherwise distribute securities of the Company to the holders of its Class A Common Stock, the number of shares of stock or other securities of the Company then being so issued to the Employee with respect to the Shares of the Restricted Stock Award, that are subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, shall be added to the Shares subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights.  If the Company shall distribute to its stockholders securities of another corporation, the securities of such other corporation then being so distributed to the Employee with respect to the Shares of the Restricted Stock Award, that are subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, shall be added to the Shares subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights.  If the outstanding shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock shall
 be subdivided into a greater number of shares or combined into a smaller number of shares, or in the event of a reclassification of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, or if the Company shall be a party to a merger, consolidation or capital reorganization, there shall be substituted for the Shares of the Restricted Stock Award then subject to this Agreement such amount and kind of securities (or cash) as are issued in such subdivision, combination, reclassification, merger, consolidation or capital reorganization in respect of such Shares subject immediately prior thereto to the Company's Forfeiture Right pursuant to this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Tax Matters.</U>  In the event that an Employee is subject to federal, state or local (including international) income tax and the Company becomes obligated to pay withholding of taxes as a result of the expiration of any restrictions hereunder applicable to any particular Share of Restricted Stock Award or an election made by the Employee under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Employee or such other person entitled to receive such Restricted Stock Award shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the amount of such withholding payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Legend and Other Transfer Restrictions</U>.  Prior to the Full Vesting Date, (or earlier upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Award pursuant to <U>Section 2(c)</U> above), all certificates representing the then-non-vested Shares of the Restricted Stock Award shall have endorsed thereon, in addition to any other legends required by applicable securities laws, a legend substantially as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"THE SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OF THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, WHETHER VOLUNTARY, INVOLUNTARY, OR BY OPERATION OF LAW, IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON SALE AND TRANSFER (INCLUDING FORFEITURE) AS SET FORTH IN THE ALPHARMA INC. 2003 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN AND IN THE ASSOCIATED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED OR AMENDED AND RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME.  COPIES OF THE PLAN AND SUCH RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM ALPHARMA INC."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the transfer restrictions referred to above and in <U>Section 7</U> above, the Employee recognizes that United States federal and state securities laws govern and may restrict his or her right to sell or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock Award after the Full Vesting Date (or such earlier vesting date pursuant to <U>Section 2(c)</U> above).  The Employee also understands that local non-United States laws may also govern the Employee's disposition of Shares, if the Employee is located outside of the United States.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Equitable Relief and Consent to Jurisdiction</U>.  The Employee specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, the attempted transfer of all or part of the Restricted Stock Award by the Employee in violation of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be adequate to compensate the Company, and, therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any right to damages, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief from any court having competent jurisdiction.  Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Section 83(b) Election</U>.  If the Employee is subject to United States federal income tax, the Employee hereby acknowledges that he or she has been informed that, with respect to the Restricted Stock Award, an election may be filed by the Employee with the Internal Revenue Service (<B>"<U>IRS</U>"</B>)<B>,</B> within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the Restricted Stock Award to the Employee, electing pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be taxed currently on any difference between the purchase price of the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Award (paid by the Employee for such Restricted Stock Award; in this Agreement, that amount is $0.00) and the fair market value of the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Award on the date of purchase (market price for the Class A Common Stock (the Grant Price per Share)).  Absent such an election, taxable income will be measured and recognized by the Employee at the time of 
the Full Vesting Date (or such earlier vesting date pursuant to <U>Section 2(c)</U> above with respect to earlier-vested Shares of the Restricted Stock Award).  Absent such an election, alternative minimum taxable income will be measured and recognized by the Employee at the time of vesting.  The Employee is strongly encouraged to seek the advice of his or her own tax consultants in connection with the issuance of the Restricted Stock Award and the advisability of filing of the election under Section 83(b) of the Code.  The Employee shall promptly provide a copy of any such election filed with the IRS with the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The Company hereby grants to the Director, subject to the restrictions, forfeiture risks, and other terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the "Restricted Unit Award", which shall consist of restricted units in the amount of that Number of Restricted Units (defined above) (each, a <B>"<U>Restricted Unit</U>"</B>), granted at the Grant Price (defined above).  Each Restricted Unit represents the Director's right to receive, under the terms and conditions described in this Agreement, payment of one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock (the <B>"<U>Common Stock</U>"</B>) upon vesting of such Restricted Unit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Restricted Unit Award shall not be considered granted unless and until the Director accepts the terms of this Agreement through the E*Trade system by clicking the button marked "ACCEPT" and completing each action required by the subsequent electronic prompts.

<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<U>Restrictions / Rights of Company and Director</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Vesting of Restricted Units</U>.  The Director shall become vested in the Restricted Units, and shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Units (the <B>"<U>Director Common Stock</U>"</B>), on the date which is one year from the date of the Director's Retirement (defined below) (the <B>"<U>Vesting Date</U>"</B>), subject to acceleration, forfeiture, deferral, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this <U>Section&nbsp;2</U>.  This Restricted Unit Award shall be considered <B>"<U>Vested</U>"</B> for all purposes under this Agreement with respect to individual Restricted Units upon the first date the Restricted Unit Award is vested with respect to such Restricted Unit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>Forfeiture Rights of the Company (Termination, Retirement, etc.)</U>.  Subject to the further provisions of this Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in <U>Section 2(c)</U> below, prior to the Vesting Date, in the event that the Director voluntarily resigns his or her position as a director of the Company, other than as a result of the Disability or Retirement of the Director, all Restricted Units shall be automatically forfeited by the Director. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Acceleration Rights of the Director</U> / <U>The Death or Disability of the Director</U>.  In the event that the Director dies, or an event of Disability takes place, or a Change in Control shall have occurred prior to the Vesting Date, the Director (or his or her beneficiary) shall be immediately 100% vested in all of the Restricted Units granted hereunder and all of the Company's forfeiture rights under <U>Section 2(b)</U> above (the <B>"<U>Company's Forfeiture Rights</U>"</B>) in such Restricted Units shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Deferral of Vesting of Restricted Units</U>.  The Director may defer receipt of the Director Common Stock beyond the Vesting Date by providing written notice to the Company in accordance with <U>Section 14</U> hereof setting forth the Director's desire to so defer.  Such deferral must meet the requirements of all applicable federal, state and local (including non-United States) laws regarding deferral of director compensation.  If the Director chooses to defer receipt of the Common Stock, he or she must defer all of the Director Common Stock vesting on the Vesting Date.  Any deferrals made by a Director under this Agreement shall be made pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<U>Definitions</U>.  For purposes of this Agreement: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;An event of <B>"<U>Disability</U>"</B> shall mean a resignation from the Board of Directors of the Company (the <B>"<U>Board</U>"</B>) for reasons of the Director's disability, as determined by the Board from time to time. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<B>"<U>Retirement</U>"</B> shall mean (i) declining to stand for re-election to the Board at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company following the end of the Director's then-current term, (ii) a failure to be nominated for re-election by the Board at the end of the Director's then-current term, or (iii) a failure to be elected as a director of the Company by a vote of the stockholders of the Company after being nominated to serve as a director of the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<B>"<U>Change in Control</U>"</B> shall have that meaning set forth in the Company's Change in Control Plan, as amended from time to time (it being understood and agreed that such Change in Control Plan shall otherwise not apply to the Director).  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<U>Voting and Other Rights</U>.  The Director shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Restricted Units, including the right to vote and to receive regular or special cash dividends, prior to the Vesting Date (or, if the Director has deferred receipt pursuant to <U>Section 2(d)</U> above, then such later date of receipt of the Director Common Stock). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<U>Prohibition on Transfer</U>.  The Director is subject to Section 8.3 of the Plan, which sets forth restrictions on the transferability, sale, pledge, assignment, etc. of the Restricted Units.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>Delivery of Certificates or Equivalent</U>.  Upon the Vesting Date (or, if the Director has deferred receipt pursuant to <U>Section 2(d)</U> above, then upon such later date of elected receipt of the Director Common Stock), the Company shall, at its election, either (i) deliver to the Director a certificate representing the Director Common Stock, or (ii) establish a brokerage account for the Director and credit to that account the Director Common Stock plus, in either case, a cash payment equal to the value of any fractional Restricted Unit then Vested.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;<U>Additional Securities</U>.  If the Company shall pay a stock dividend or declare a stock split on or with respect to any of its Common Stock, or otherwise distribute securities of the Company to the holders of its Common Stock, the number of Restricted Units subject to this award shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights.  If the Company shall distribute to its stockholders securities of another corporation, the securities of such other corporation, distributed with respect to the Restricted Units then subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, shall be added to the Restricted Units subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights.  If the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares or combined into a smaller number of shares, or in the event of a reclassification of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, or if th
e Company shall be a party to a merger, consolidation or capital reorganization, there shall be substituted for the Restricted Units then subject to this Agreement such amount and kind of securities (or cash) as are issued in such subdivision, combination, reclassification, merger, consolidation or capital reorganization in respect of the Restricted Units subject immediately prior thereto to the Company's Forfeiture Right pursuant to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, regular or special cash dividends paid by the Company on the Common Stock shall not affect the number of Restricted Units granted to the Director under this Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;<U>Tax Matters.</U>  In the event that the Director is subject to federal, state or local (including international) income tax and the Company becomes obligated to pay withholding of such taxes as a result of the expiration of any restrictions hereunder applicable to any share of Common Stock deliverable in connection with the Restricted Units, the Director or such other person entitled to receive such Common Stock deliverable in connection with the Restricted Units, shall pay to the Company (as a condition of delivery) an amount equal to the amount of such withholding payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;<U>Equitable Relief and Consent to Jurisdiction</U>.  The Director specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the attempted transfer of the Restricted Units by the Director in violation of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be adequate to compensate the Company, and, therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any right to damages, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief from any court having competent jurisdiction.  Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;<U>No Section 83(b) Election</U>. The Director hereby agrees that he or she may not and will not attempt to make an election with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be taxed currently on any difference between the purchase price of the Restricted Units and the fair market value of the Director Common Stock. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&#9;<U>Registration</U>.  The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Director Common Stock.  The Company intends to maintain this registration but has no obligation to do so.  If the registration ceases to be effective, the Director will not be able to transfer or sell the Director Common Stock unless exemptions from registration are available.  Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might be unavailable.  The Director agrees that any resale by the Director of the Director Common Stock shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and any other law, rule or regulation applicable thereto, as such laws, rules and regulations may be amended from time to t
ime.  The Company shall not be obligated to either issue the Director Common Stock or permit the resale of any Director Common Stock if such issuance or resale would violate any such requirements.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&#9;<U>Consent</U>.  The Director specifically acknowledges that the Company must use certain personal information of the Director for the limited purpose of granting and administering Restricted Units to the Director, including sharing such information with E*Trade and/or other third party administrators, and that such use may include the transfer of the Director's personal information across international borders, and the Director hereby consents to the use of his or her personal information for such purpose.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&#9;<U>Administration.</U>  This Agreement and the Director's rights hereunder are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations and administrative decisions that may be adopted thereunder.  The Company may terminate, amend or modify the Plan at any time; provided that no such action shall in any way adversely affect the Director's rights under this Agreement.  For the Director's reference, a copy of the Plan is available for the Director's review as part of the E*Trade delivery system, as publicly filed with the Company's securities filings, and with representative Company Human Resources personnel. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.&#9;<U>Notices</U>.  Any notice or other communication to be made, served or given to the Company under or pursuant to the terms hereof (a <B>"<U>Notice</U>"</B>) shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Company, in care of the Vice President, Compensation &amp; Benefits, at One Executive Drive, Fort Lee, New Jersey 07024 USA, and any notice to be given to the Director shall be in writing and addressed to the Director's address maintained from time to time in the employment records of the Company or any affiliate, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other.

The substance of any Notice shall be deemed to have been fully acknowledged in the event of refusal of acceptance by the party to whom the notice is addressed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&#9;<U>Binding Effect</U>.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Director and the Company and their respective permitted successors, assigns, heirs, beneficiaries and representatives.  This Agreement is personal to the Director and may not be assigned by him or her without the prior written consent of the Company.

Furthermore, the Director hereby irrevocably submits to the co-exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the Superior Court of New Jersey, and (ii) the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement.  THE SECURITIES ISSUED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORPORATE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE NON-UNITED STATES LAWS.  Each

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&#9;<U>Severability</U>.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, but shall be interpreted as if it were written so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties waive any provision of law that renders any provisions hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">18.&#9;<U>Entire Agreement</U>.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">19.&#9;<U>Modifications and Amendments; Waivers and Consents</U>.  The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be modified, amended, renewed, or terminated, nor may any term, condition or breach of any term or condition be waived, except by a writing signed by the Company and the Director.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">20.&#9;<U>Consent of Spouse</U>.  If the Director is married as of the date of this Agreement, the Director's spouse shall execute a Consent of Spouse in a form acceptable to the Company (a sample of which is included as <U>Exhibit A</U> hereto), effective as of the date hereof.

If the Director marries or remarries subsequent to the date hereof, the Director shall, not later than sixty (60) days thereafter, obtain his or her new spouse's acknowledgment of and consent to the existence and binding effect of all restrictions contained in this Agreement by such spouse's executing and delivering a Consent of Spouse form.</P>

Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<U>Grant and Acceptance of Restricted Stock Unit Award</U>.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The Company hereby grants to the Employee, subject to the restrictions, forfeiture risks and other terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the "Restricted Stock Unit Award", which shall consist of restricted units in the amount of that Number of Restricted Units (defined above) (each, a <B>"<U>Restricted Unit</U>"</B>), granted at the Grant Price (defined above) per Restricted Unit.  Each Restricted Unit represents the Employee's right to receive, under the terms and conditions described in this Agreement, payment of one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock (the <B>"<U>Common Stock</U>"</B>) upon vesting of such Restricted Unit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not be considered granted unless and until the Employee accepts the terms of this Agreement through the E*Trade system by clicking the button marked "ACCEPT" and completing each action required by the subsequent electronic prompts.  By so accepting the Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Employee is memorializing that he or she has accepted the Restricted Stock Unit Award as of the Grant Date.  Thereafter, the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule (defined above), unless earlier accelerated or forfeited as set forth herein.  This Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be considered <B>"<U>Vested</U>"</B> for all purposes under this Agreement with respect to individual Restricted Units upon the first date the Restricted Stock Unit Award is vested with respect to such Restricted Units pursuant to the above schedule.  (If the Company has no record of the Employee's acceptance of the terms of this Agreement, or any o
ther document required by the Company in connection with the Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be ineffective and the Employee shall have no rights in the Restricted Stock Unit Award).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<U>Restrictions / Rights of Company and Employee</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Vesting of Restricted Stock Unit Award</U>.  The Employee shall become Vested in the Restricted Units in accordance with the Vesting Schedule, and shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock represented by the then-Vested Restricted Units (the <B>"<U>Vested Shares</U>"</B>) upon Vesting.  The Employee shall become 100% Vested in the Restricted Stock Unit Award (in all Restricted Units) on the Full Vesting Date, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this <U>Section 2</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>Forfeiture Rights of the Company Upon Termination</U>.  Subject to the further provisions of this Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in <U>Section 2(c)</U> below, prior to the Full Vesting Date, in the event that the Employee ceases to be a continuing employee of the Company as a result of a termination of his or her Employment by the Company (with or without cause), other than as a result of the death, Disability, or Retirement of the Employee, the non-Vested portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall automatically be forfeited by the Employee, and shall, with no further action on the part of the Employee, revert to the full beneficial and record ownership of the Company (the <B>"<U>Forfeiture Event</U>"</B>).  (The terms <B>"<U>Employment</U>"</B>, <B>"<U>Retirement</U>"</B> and <B>"<U>Disability</U>"</B> are defined in <U>Section 3</U> below.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Acceleration Rights of the Employee</U> / <U>The Death, Disability, or Retirement of the Employee</U>.  In the event that the Employee dies, or an event of Disability or the Retirement of the Employee occurs prior to the Full Vesting Date, the Employee shall be immediately 100% vested in all of the Restricted Units underlying the entire Restricted Stock Unit Award granted hereunder and all of the Company's forfeiture rights under <U>Section 2(b)</U> above (the <B>"<U>Company's Forfeiture Rights</U>"</B>) in such Restricted Units shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Change in Control</U>.  In the event that a Change in Control (as defined in the Alpharma Inc. Change in Control Plan, as amended from time to time (the <B>"<U>Change in Control Plan</U>"</B>)) occurs, the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be governed by the Change in Control Plan and the provisions of this Agreement that contradict such Change in Control Plan shall become ineffective.  For the Employee's reference, a copy of the Change in Control Plan is publicly available as an exhibit to the Company's securities filings, and is also available for review upon request.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<U>Definitions</U>.  For purposes of this Agreement: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;An event of <B>"<U>Disability</U>"</B> shall mean the Employee's termination in good standing from the employ of the Company for reasons of disability under the then-established rules of the Company, consistent with all applicable federal, state and local (including international) laws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;An event of <B>"<U>Retirement</U>"</B> shall mean the Employee's voluntary termination of his or her Employment with the Company under circumstances which would permit the Employee to receive retirement or early retirement benefits under a formal Company-sponsored pension plan or similar arrangement (assuming for the limited purposes of this definition that the Employee meets all of the criteria for participation in such plan or arrangement).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<B>"<U>Employment</U>"</B> shall mean the continuing status of the Employee as a full-time permanent salaried or hourly employee of the Company or another entity so long as that entity is, and at all relevant times continues to be, an affiliate (as that term is defined under the regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission) of the Company.  Employment (i)&nbsp;shall include any period of illness or temporary disability during which the Employee continues to receive salary pursuant to the policies of the Company, as in effect from time to time, but (ii)&nbsp;shall not include any period of time during which the Employee is receiving salary continuation, payments in lieu of statutory or other notice, or during a statutory notice period, or other benefits as a result of the termination of Employment or any leave of absence of a duration longer than three (3) months.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<U>Issuance of Stock Certificate(s)</U>.  Upon the occurrence of the Full Vesting Date, (or earlier upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award pursuant to <U>Section 2(c)</U> above), the Secretary of the Company (the <B>"<U>Secretary</U>"</B>) shall promptly, upon written request, deliver to the Employee a stock certificate (or certificates) representing all Vested Shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<U>No Liability</U>.  Neither the Company nor the Secretary shall be liable for any act it may do or omit to do with respect to the Restricted Stock Unit Award.  The Secretary is expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person or corporation, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court.  In the event that the Secretary obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree, the Secretary shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.  The Secretary shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authorities or rights of the parties executing or deliverin
g or purporting to execute or deliver the Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.  The Secretary shall be entitled to employ such legal counsel (which may be counsel to the Company) and other experts as it may deem necessary in connection with its obligations hereunder, it may rely upon the advice of such counsel, and it may cause the Company to pay such counsel reasonable compensation therefor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>Disputes</U>.  It is understood and agreed that should any dispute arise with respect to the delivery and/or ownership or right of possession of any Vested Shares or Restricted Units of the Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Secretary is authorized and directed to retain in its possession or to deliver into court without liability to anyone, all or any part of said Vested Shares until such disputes shall have been settled either by mutual written agreement of the parties concerned or by a final order, decree or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction after the time for appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected, but the Secretary shall be under no duty whatsoever to institute or defend any such proceedings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;<U>Prohibition on Transfer</U>.  The Employee is subject to Section 8.3 of the Plan, which sets forth restrictions on the transferability, sale, pledge, assignment, etc. of the Restricted Stock Unit Award.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;<U>Tax Matters.</U>  In the event that an Employee is subject to federal, state or local (including international) income tax and the Company becomes obligated to pay withholding of taxes as a result of this Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Employee or such other person entitled to receive such Restricted Stock Unit Award shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the amount of such withholding payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;<U>Equitable Relief and Consent to Jurisdiction</U>.  The Employee specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, the attempted transfer of all or part of the Restricted Stock Unit Award by the Employee in violation of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be adequate to compensate the Company, and, therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any right to damages, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief from any court having competent jurisdiction.  Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;<U>Employment</U>.  The Company is not by this Agreement obligated to continue the Employee as an employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, and the Company or any affiliate employing the Employee may terminate his or her Employment or otherwise treat him or her without regard to the effect it may have upon him or her under this Agreement.  The Company and the Employee understand and agree that any references herein to employment of the Employee by the Company shall include the Employee's Employment or service as an employee of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&#9;<U>Voting Rights and Dividends.</U>  The Employee shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Restricted Units, including the right to vote and to receive regular or special cash dividends, prior to the issuance of Vested Shares with respect to such Restricted Units.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&#9;<U>Additional Securities</U>.  If the Company shall pay a stock dividend or declare a stock split on or with respect to any of its Common Stock, or otherwise distribute securities of the Company to the holders of its Common Stock, the number of Restricted Units subject to this award shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights.  If the Company shall distribute to its stockholders securities of another corporation, the securities of such other corporation, distributed with respect to the Restricted Units then subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, shall be added to the Restricted Units subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights.  If the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares or combined into a smaller number of shares, or in the event of a reclassification of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, or if t
he Company shall be a party to a merger, consolidation or capital reorganization, there shall be substituted for the Restricted Units then subject to this Agreement such amount and kind of securities (or cash) as are issued in such subdivision, combination, reclassification, merger, consolidation or capital reorganization in respect of the Restricted Units subject immediately prior thereto to the Company's Forfeiture Right pursuant to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, regular or special cash dividends paid by the Company on the Common Stock shall not affect the number of Restricted Units granted to the Employee under this Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&#9;<U>Consent</U>.  The Employee specifically acknowledges that the Company must use certain personal information of the Employee for the limited purpose of granting and administering the Restricted Stock Unit Award to the Employee, including sharing such information with E*Trade or other third party administrators, and that such use may include the transfer of the Employee's personal information across international borders, and the Employee hereby consents to the use of his or her personal information for such purpose.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.&#9;<U>Administration.</U>  This Agreement and the Employee's rights hereunder are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations and administrative decisions that may be adopted thereunder.  The Company may terminate, amend or modify the Plan at any time; provided that no such action shall in any way adversely affect the Employee's rights under this Agreement.  For the Employee's reference, a copy of the Plan is available for the Employee's review as part of the E*Trade delivery system, as publicly filed with the Company's securities filings, and with representative Company Human Resources personnel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&#9;<U>Notices</U>.  Any notice or other communication to be made, served or given to the Company under or pursuant to the terms hereof (a <B>"<U>Notice</U>"</B>) shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Company, in care of the Vice President, Compensation &amp; Benefits, at One Executive Drive, Fort Lee, New Jersey 07024 USA, and any notice to be given to the Employee shall be in writing and addressed to the Employee's address maintained from time to time in the employment records of the Company or any affiliate, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other.

on receipt if personally delivered, two (2) days after it has been delivered to a nationally (internationally) known overnight courier, and three (3) days after it has been deposited in the United States mail (or other non-United States government-sponsored mail system) if sent by mail.  If a Notice is delivered otherwise than as set forth above, it shall be deemed to have been given when received.  The substance of any Notice shall be deemed to have been fully acknowledged in the event of refusal of acceptance by the party to whom the notice is addressed.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16.&#9;<U>Binding Effect</U>.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Employee and the Company and their respective permitted successors, assigns, heirs, beneficiaries and representatives.  This Agreement is personal to the Employee and may not be assigned by him or her without the prior written consent of the Company.  Any attempted assignment in violation of this <U>Section 16</U> shall be null and void.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&#9;<U>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</U>.  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the terms of Section 20.5 of the Plan providing for use of the internal laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, insofar as the Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States, the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware (or any successor statute) shall govern those matters that apply to the internal governance of the Company.  Furthermore, the Employee hereby irrevocably submits to the co-exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the Superior Court of New Jersey, and (ii) the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement.  THE SECURITIES ISSUED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORPORATE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE NON-UNITED STATES LAWS.  Each 
of the parties hereto further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or documents by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, or internationally-known courier, in accordance with the provisions of <U>Section 15</U> above, shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in New Jersey. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">18.&#9;<U>Severability</U>.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, but shall be interpreted as if it were written so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties waive any provision of law that renders any provisions hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">19.&#9;<U>Entire Agreement</U>.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.  No statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement not expressly set forth in this Agreement or incorporated herein by reference shall affect or be used to interpret, change or restrict the express terms and provisions of this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">20.&#9;<U>Modifications and Amendments; Waivers and Consents</U>.  The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be modified, amended, renewed, or terminated, nor may any term, condition or breach of any term or condition be waived, except by a writing signed by the Company and the Employee.  Any waiver of any term, condition or breach hereof shall not be a waiver of any other term or condition or of the same term or condition for the future, or of any subsequent breach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">21.&#9;<U>Consent of Spouse</U>.  If the Employee is married as of the date of this Agreement, the Employee's spouse shall execute a Consent of Spouse in a form acceptable to the Company (a sample of which is included as <U>Exhibit A</U> hereto), effective as of the date hereof.  Such consent shall not be deemed to confer or convey to the spouse any rights in the Restricted Stock Unit Award that do not otherwise exist by operation of law or the agreement of the parties.  If the Employee marries or remarries subsequent to the date hereof, the Employee shall, not later than sixty (60) days thereafter, obtain his or her new spouse's acknowledgment of and consent to the existence and binding effect of all restrictions contained in this Agreement by such spouse's executing and delivering a Consent of Spouse form.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, ____________________________, spouse of _____________________, acknowledge that I have read the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement dated as of __________, 20__ (the "<U>Agreement</U>") and that I know its contents.  Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.  I am aware that, by its provisions, the Restricted Stock Unit Award owned by my spouse is subject to forfeiture in favor of Alpharma Inc. (the "<U>Company</U>") and that, accordingly, the Restricted Stock Unit Award, shall, upon a Forfeiture Event, automatically revert to the ownership of the Company, and this may include Restricted Units of which I may become possessed as a result of a court decree and/or any property settlement in any domestic litigation (or otherwise).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hereby agree that my interest, if any, in the Restricted Stock Unit Award subject to the Agreement shall be irrevocably bound by the Agreement and I further understand and agree that any community property interest I may have in the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be similarly bound by the Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree to the Company's Forfeiture Rights described in the Agreement and I hereby consent to the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Unit Award to the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.  Further, as part of the consideration for the Agreement, I agree that, at my death, if I have not disposed of any interest of mine in the Restricted Stock Unit Award by an outright bequest of the Restricted Stock Unit Award to my spouse, then the Company shall have the same rights against my legal representative to exercise its rights of forfeiture with respect to any interest of mine in the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it would have had pursuant to the Agreement if I had acquired such interest pursuant to a court decree in domestic litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I AM AWARE THAT THE LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND RELATED MATTERS CONTAINED IN THE AGREEMENT ARE COMPLEX AND THAT I AM FREE TO SEEK INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE OR COUNSEL WITH RESPECT TO THIS CONSENT.

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION I</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Defined Terms</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless otherwise defined above or herein, or unless the context requires a different definition, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION II</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">GRANT OF OptionS, Price and Exercise</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>GRANT; PRICE</U>.  Effective as of the Grant Date, the Company grants to the Optionee, subject to the terms and provisions set forth herein and in the Plan, the right and option to purchase all or any part of Number of Option Shares (defined above) of the presently authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock of the Company (the <B>"<U>Shares</U>"</B>), at the Option Price (defined above) per Share, which Option Price is not less than 100% of the fair market value of each Share on the Grant Date (the option hereby granted being referred to as the <B>"<U>Option</U>"</B>).   This Option is not intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>EXERCISABILITY</U>.  The Option shall not be considered granted or become exercisable unless and until the Optionee accepts the terms of this Agreement through the E*Trade system by clicking the button marked "ACCEPT" and completing each action required by the subsequent electronic prompts.  By so accepting the Option, the Optionee is memorializing that he or she has accepted the Option as of the Grant Date.  Thereafter, the Option shall be exercisable, subject to earlier termination or acceleration as specifically provided in this Agreement, in accordance with the Vesting Schedule (defined above).  This Option shall be considered <B>"<U>Vested</U>"</B> for all purposes under this Agreement with respect to individual Shares upon the first date the Option is vested (exercisable) with respect to such Shares pursuant to the Vesting Schedule.  Neither the Option nor any other rights granted under this Agreement may be exercised after the Expiration Date (defined above) and, before th
at time, the Option may be terminated or accelerated as hereinafter provided.  (If the Company has no record of the Optionee's acceptance of the terms of this Agreement, or any other document required by the Company in connection with the Option, the Option shall be ineffective and the Optionee shall have no rights in the Option).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION III</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Exercise Procedure, Withholding, CONDITION TO EXERCISE And Securities laws matters</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>EXERCISE</U>.  The Optionee shall exercise the Option by notifying the Company of the number of Shares that he or she desires to purchase and by delivering with such notice the full payment of the Option Price of the Shares being purchased.  The Option Price shall be payable (1) in cash or its equivalent, (2) by tendering (either by actual delivery or attestation) previously acquired Shares, provided such Shares had been held by the Optionee for at least six (6) months prior to their tender or have been purchased on the open market, (3) in cash derived from the contemporaneous sale of a portion of the Shares received from the exercise of the Option, or (4) in a combination of cash, Share tender and/or cash derived from the sale of Shares.  For purposes of determining the amount, if any, of the Option Price satisfied by the sale of Shares, such Shares shall be valued at the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise.  Any Shares sold in satisfaction o
f all or a portion of the Option Price shall be transferred or assigned pursuant to procedures adopted by the Company from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>WITHHOLDING</U>.  The Company will, as soon as is reasonably possible, notify the Optionee of the amount of withholding tax, if any, that must be paid under United States federal, state and local law, or similar applicable non-United States laws, due to the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver certificates for the Shares purchased until the Optionee pays to the Company the amount of withholding specified in the Company's notice.  Alternatively, the Optionee may direct the Company to withhold that number of Shares (valued according to the procedures set forth in <U>Section III (a)</U> above on the date of withholding) sufficient to satisfy such obligation, subject to such restrictions or procedures as the Company deems necessary.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>CONDITION TO EXERCISE</U>.  Before the Optionee may exercise the Option or any part thereof, the Company must first receive from the Optionee: (1)&nbsp;the Optionee's written acknowledgement that the Optionee has read, and has been afforded an opportunity to ask questions of management of the Company regarding, all financial and other information regarding the Company which the Optionee considers important in deciding whether to exercise the Option, (2)&nbsp;the Optionee's written representation that the Optionee is purchasing the Shares for the Optionee's own account and not on behalf of others, and (3) appropriate payment or other arrangements with respect to any withholding tax requirement arising from exercise of the Option.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>SECURITIES LAWS MATTERS</U>.  The Optionee understands and acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws govern and restrict the Optionee's right to offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares unless the offer, sale or other disposition thereof is registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the <B>"'<U>33 Act</U>"</B>) and any applicable state securities laws.  Furthermore, the Optionee understands that local non-U.S. laws may also govern the Optionee's disposition of Shares.  The Optionee agrees that the Optionee will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares in any manner which would require the Company to file any registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or similar filing under state or local law) or to violate the '33 Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any other state, federal or local law.  The Optionee further understands that the certificates for any Shares the Optionee purchases will bear su
ch legends as the Company deems necessary or desirable in connection with the '33 Act or other rules, regulations or laws.  NOTHING IN THIS OPTION ALTERS THE GENERAL RULE THAT THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT TRADE IN THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES (INCLUDING THE SALE OF SHARES ACQUIRED BY EXERCISING THIS OPTION) DURING A COMPANY-IMPOSED QUARTERLY BLACK-OUT PERIOD OR WHILE HE OR SHE IS IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY (UNLESS THE OPTIONEE HAS GIVEN PRIOR INSTRUCTIONS MEETING LEGAL REQUIREMENTS).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION IV</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Termination of Employment</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>TERMINATION FOR CAUSE</U>.  If the Optionee's employment with the Company or any affiliate terminates for Cause (which shall have a definition herein identical to the definition of <B>"<U>Termination for Cause</U>"</B> under the Company's Severance Plan, as amended from time to time) all Shares represented by the Option, whether Vested or unvested on such termination date, shall terminate with immediate effect and shall no longer be exercisable.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>TERMINATION OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE</U>.  Except as set forth in this <U>Section's (c), (d), (e), or (f)</U> below, if the Optionee's employment with the Company or any affiliate is terminated (1)&nbsp;voluntarily by the Optionee, or (2) by the Company other than in a Termination for Cause, all Shares represented by the Option that are Vested on such termination date shall remain exercisable for one (1) month after the termination date, after which time they shall be terminated.  All Shares represented by the Option that are unvested on the date of termination shall be forfeited with immediate effect.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>RETIREMENT</U>.  If the Optionee should leave the employ of the Company or its affiliates by reason of an event of Retirement prior to the Expiration Date, all Shares subject to this Option shall continue to Vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule, and shall be exercisable at any time prior to the Expiration Date.  An event of <B>"<U>Retirement</U>"</B> shall mean the Optionee's voluntary termination of his or her Employment with the Company under circumstances which would permit the Optionee to receive retirement or early retirement benefits under a formal Company-sponsored pension plan or similar arrangement (assuming for the limited purposes of this definition that the Optionee meets all of the criteria for participation in such plan or arrangement).  <B>"<U>Employment</U>"</B> shall mean the continuing status of the Optionee as a full-time permanent salaried or hourly employee of the Company or another entity so long as that entity is, and at all relevant times continues
 to be, an affiliate (as that term is defined under the regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission) of the Company.  Employment (i) shall include any period of illness or temporary disability during which the Optionee continues to receive salary pursuant to the policies of the Company, as in effect from time to time, but (ii) shall not include any period of time during which the Optionee is receiving salary continuation, payments in lieu of statutory or other notice, or during a statutory notice period, or other benefits as a result of the termination of Employment or any leave of absence of a duration longer than three (3) months.  </P>
<B>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>DISABILITY</U>.  If the Optionee should leave the employ of the Company or its affiliates by reason of an event of Disability prior to the Expiration Date, all Shares subject to this Option shall immediately Vest and shall be exercisable for one (1) year after the date on which the Optionee ceases being an employee.  An event of <B>"<U>Disability</U>"</B> shall mean the Optionee's termination in good standing from the employ of the Company for reasons of disability under the then-established rules of the Company, consistent with all applicable federal, state and local (including international) laws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;<U>DEATH</U>.  If the Optionee should die while an employee and prior to the Expiration Date, all Shares subject to this Option shall immediately Vest and be exercisable by his or her beneficiary, executor or estate (in accordance with applicable law) for a period of one (1) year after the date of the Optionee's death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&#9;<U>CHANGE IN CONTROL</U>.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company that occurs prior to the Expiration Date and while the Optionee is an employee of the Company or an affiliate, the Option shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Company's Change in Control Plan, as amended from time to time.  <B>"<U>Change in Control</U>"</B> shall have the meaning set forth in such Change in Control Plan.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION V</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Non-Assignability and Non-Exercisability</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>NON-ASSIGNABILITY</U>.  The Option shall not be sold, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Further, the Option shall be exercisable during the Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee or, during periods of legal disability, by the Optionee's legal representative.  No Option shall be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>NON-EXERCISABILITY</U>.  In no event may the Options be exercisable to any extent by anyone after the Expiration Date.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION VI</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LIMITATIONS OF Rights in Stock AND EMPLOYMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>NO STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS</U>.  Neither the Optionee, nor the Optionee's successor-in-interest, shall have any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Shares for which the Option is issued until such Shares are issued by the Company.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS</U>.  It is expressly agreed that, anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute, or be evidence of, any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company or an affiliate will employ the Optionee for any period of time or in any position or for any particular compensation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION VII</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Notices</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any notice or other communication to be made, served or given to the Company under or pursuant to the terms hereof (a <B>"<U>Notice</U>"</B>) shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Company, in care of the Vice President &amp; Treasurer, at One Executive Drive, Fort Lee, New Jersey 07024 USA, and any notice to be given to the Optionee shall be in writing and addressed to the Optionee's address maintained from time to time in the employment records of the Company or any affiliate, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other.  Such Notice shall be sent by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by a nationally known overnight courier (or internationally known courier if sent from outside of the United States), providing written proof of delivery.

If a Notice is delivered otherwise than as set forth above, it shall be deemed to have been given when received.  The substance of any Notice shall be deemed to have been fully acknowledged in the event of refusal of acceptance by the party to whom the notice is addressed.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Miscellaneous</P>

In order to be effective, a designation of beneficiary must be completed by the Optionee and received by the Company prior to the date of the Optionee's death.  In the absence of such designation, the Optionee's beneficiary shall be the legal representative of the Optionee's estate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>INCORPORATION OF PLAN</U><I>.</I> The terms and provisions of the Plan are hereby incorporated in this Agreement. Unless otherwise specifically stated herein, such terms and provisions shall control in the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>GOVERNING LAW</U><I>.</I>  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the terms of Section 20.5 of the Plan providing for use of the internal laws of the State of New Jersey in the United States; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, insofar as the Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States, the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware (or any successor statute) shall govern those matters that apply to the internal governance of the Company.
