&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals.  The Company markets one branded pharmaceutical prescription product that is contract manufactured by a third-party, a pain medication sold under the trademark KADIAN, in the U.S.  Alpharma manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients and one chemically synthesized active pharmaceutical ingredient (collectively "APIs") that are used primarily by third parties in the manufacturing of finished dose products.  The Company manufactures and markets animal health products in over 100 formulations and dosage forms.  The Company presently conducts business in more than 80 countries and has approximately 1,400 employees in over 20 countries.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company generated revenues of approximately $653.8 million from its continuing operations.  Revenues from discontinued opera
tions totaled $17.1 million in 2006, and related to the Company's former generics  pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution business which was sold on March 31, 2006. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Formation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is incorporated in Delaware.  The Company was originally organized as A.L. Laboratories, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S., a Norwegian healthcare company (the predecessor company to A.L. Industrier ASA; formerly Alpharma's controlling stockholder).  In 1994, the Company acquired the complementary human pharmaceutical and animal health business of its parent company and subsequently changed its name to Alpharma Inc. to operate worldwide as one corporate entity<B>.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Repurchase of Class B Shares; Elimination of Controlling Stockholder</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until December 28, 2006, A.L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier") beneficially owned all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock, or approximately 22% of the Company's total common stock as of such date.   Through its ownership of the Class B common stock, Industrier had voting power that provided it with effective control of the Company.  On December 28, 2006, two of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries purchased 100% (11,872,897 shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from Industrier at a price of $25.50 per share.  Including related fees, the cost of the repurchase was approximately $307.4 million, which was paid using available cash on hand.  Following the Class B share repurchase, control of the Company now rests in the holders of the Class A shares acting by the majority applicable under Delaware law and the Company's charter documents. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discontinued Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 19, 2005, the Company sold its world-wide human Generics pharmaceutical business (the "Generics Business"), excluding ParMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("ParMed"), its Generics pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution unit, to Actavis Group hf  ("Actavis") for cash in the amount of $810 million.  The form of this transaction included the sale of all of the Company's subsidiaries that were, as of the closing of the transaction, engaged solely in the human genericsbusiness ("Generics Business") and a transfer of the assets and liabilities related to the Generics Business from those subsidiaries of the Company that, as of the closing of the transaction, engaged in both the Generics Business and other businesses of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the transactions, substantially all of the material liabilities (including without limitation, claims, lawsuits and other contingent liabilities) of the Generics Business were transferred to Actavis or entities owned by Actavis.   The Company made certain representations and warranties to Actavis regarding the Generics Business as a part of the transaction, and subject to certain limitations, agreed to indemnify Actavis to the extent that such representations and warranties were incorrect.  In addition, the Company retained liability for certain specified liabilities which the Company believes are not, in the aggregate, material to the Company and may be held responsible for certain liabilities of the Generics Business transferred to Actavis in the event that Actavis fails to or is unable to satisfy such liabilities. The financial statements contained in this Report present the Generics Business as a discontinued operation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the proceeds of the transaction that were received as consideration for the non-US assets of the Generics Business were repatriated to the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2005, and through to January 23, 2006, the Company repaid all of its outstanding debt. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 31, 2006, the Company sold ParMed, its Generics pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution business, to Cardinal Health for cash in the amount of $40.1 million.  ParMed is presented in the financial statements contained in this Report, as a discontinued operation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, throughout this Report, "Discontinued Operations" refers to the Generics Business and ParMed.  For further information on the Discontinued Operations, see the discussion of Discontinued Operations in Item 7 of this Report, and see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M33"></A>Management and Financial Reporting Structure </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M53"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company operates in the human and animal pharmaceuticals industries.  After giving effect to the Discontinued Operations, for financial reporting purposes it has three businesses within these industries:  Pharmaceuticals ("Pharmaceuticals", formerly Branded Pharmaceuticals), Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API") and Animal Health ("AH").  </P>

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M67"></A> <B>PHARMACEUTICALS ("Pharmaceuticals")</P>
</B></FONT><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><FONT SIZE=3> Pharmaceuticals (formerly Branded Pharmaceuticals) markets one branded pharmaceutical prescription product, a pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN, that is contract manufactured by a third-party.  Pharmaceuticals is currently focused on the pain management market in the United States.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, Pharmaceuticals had product sales of approximately $138.2 million and operating income of approximately $28.3 million.  KADIAN accounted for approximately 21% of the Company's total revenues in 2006.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines.</I>  KADIAN is an extended release morphine product which, until June 2006, F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mayne Nickless Limited) licensed to Pharmaceuticals pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license. During the second quarter of 2006, Mayne Nickless Limited assigned the patent rights to Pharmaceuticals. On October 27, 2006, the Company received FDA approval for KADIAN 80 mg dosage strength and launched this line extension in the fourth quarter of 2006.  On February 27, 2007, the Company received FDA approval for KADIAN 200mg dosage strength.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">   The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of a new pain product which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse.  During the third quarter of 2006, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from a Phase II efficacy and pharmacokinetic trial for the investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product.  The goal of the study was to demonstrate that the Company's proprietary abuse-deterrent technology for long-acting opioids does not impact the safety or efficacy of the product.  This goal was achieved.  Pharmaceuticals has commenced Phase III activities on this new product and, assuming a successful Phase III outcome,  is targeting a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the first half of 2008.  The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2007 and 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Ri
sk Factors - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">   In response to a general inquiry by the FDA regarding alcohol interaction with opioids, the Company has conducted in vivo studies to evaluate the interaction of alcohol consumption with KADIAN.  The results indicate that the concomitant use of tested levels of alcohol with KADIAN has no significant impact on mean morphine blood levels.  The Company provided this data to the FDA. Based upon its review, the FDA has indicated that the KADIAN label will not require any further modifications. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    In addition to the abuse-deterrent technology described above, a major focus of the Company is to expand and enhance Pharmaceuticals' product portfolio by actively seeking to purchase marketing rights to other pain-related products (that are either in the development or commercial stages).    See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "Risk Factors - The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances and other relationships".</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities.  </I>Pharmaceuticals' one product is manufactured under a toll manufacturing agreement with Actavis Elizabeth LLC ("Actavis Elizabeth"), successor to Purepac Pharmaceutical Co., the former subsidiary of the Company purchased by Actavis  as a part of the Company's sale of the Generics Business.  Actavis Elizabeth is the sole source of supply for KADIAN.  Pharmaceuticals' headquarters are located in Piscataway, New Jersey.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition. </I>Pharmaceuticals operates in a highly competitive, price-sensitive market.  The Company's Pharmaceuticals product competes with pain management products manufactured by Generics pharmaceutical manufacturers and worldwide research-based brand drug companies.  As the Company expands its Pharmaceuticals portfolio product line, it expects to encounter continued competition.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals' principal competitors are: King Pharmaceuticals, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Purdue Pharma and Generics competitors generally.</P>
</FONT><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers.</I>  <FONT SIZE=3>The Company has a sales organization for Pharmaceuticals' branded pharmaceutical products.  Pharmaceuticals has an authorized sales force of 194 sales representatives (although the actual number of representatives will vary from time to time based upon resignations and other normal personnel actions). </FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">Pharmaceuticals </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the pain specialists who are likely to be the most active writers of prescriptions for KADIAN.   Pharmaceuticals predominately sells its pharmaceutical products to major wholesalers.   The Company has entered into distribution service agreements with certain of these accounts.  </P>
</FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS ("API")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M91"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's API business develops, manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients and one chemically synthesized active pharmaceutical ingredient that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products. For the year ended December 31, 2006, API had product sales of approximately $168.7 million and operating income of approximately $51.8 million.  The Company's API business benefits from over four decades of experience in the use and development of fermentation and purification technology. <A NAME="_DV_M92"></A></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines.  </I>The Company's API business markets and sells 14 APIs, primarily antibiotics.  These APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections.  The Company is a leading producer of bacitracin, polymyxin, and vancomycin, all of which are important pharmaceutical-grade antibiotics. The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotic active substances such as tobramycin, colistin and colistin methsulfate, and amphotericin B, a parenteral grade antifungal.  The primary applications for the API products are injectable and specialized topical and human surgical finished product applications.  API owns European marketing authorizations for vancomycin vial and capsule finished products which are manufactured (using the Company's active substance) and distributed for the Company by third parties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Company has several growth initiatives related to API.  API has initiated a program of new product launches that began in 2005 with the launch (commercial sale of product) of tobramycin and continued with the launch of fluticasone and teicoplanin in non-regulated markets in the third quarter of 2006 and mupirocin acid in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The Company intends to continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch two additional products before the end of 2007.  In addition, in the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to increase the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next three years.  During the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced the sale of vancomycin manufactured at the Hisun facility into limited markets, and began enhancing the site's manufacturing proc
esses in preparation for regulatory approvals.  Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs.  The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative.  Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing.  See "Risk Factors -.  The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M93"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2003, the Company's API business implemented a significant price increase for two of its products in certain geographical markets and, during 2005 and 2006, reduced the price significantly with respect to one of such products.  The Company anticipates that further price reductions are possible on both of these products. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M94"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities.  </I>The Company manufactures its API products in its plants in Oslo, Norway, which also manufactures products for AH, Copenhagen, Denmark and Budapest, Hungary.  Each plant includes fermentation, specialized recovery and purification equipment.  To support the production of vancomycin, the Company substantially expanded its production capacity at its Copenhagen facility and, in 1998, acquired its facility in Budapest, Hungary. An expansion of manufacturing processes and capacity at the Budapest facility was substantially completed in 2004.<B>  <A NAME="_DV_C9"></B>The expansion of the Budapest facility cost a total of approximately $9 million and doubled the capacity of the facility for vancomycin and established capacity for the production of three additional products in the facility.<B>  <A NAME="_DV_M95"></A></A></B>The Company completed two expansion projects at its Copenhagen facility in 2004 for an aggregate cost of 
approximately $32 million.  One of these projects significantly increased the capacity of the Copenhagen facility for vancomycin. Additionally, the Copenhagen facility is currently being expanded to accommodate API's initiative to expand into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs.  The Oslo, Copenhagen and Budapest facilities have been classified as acceptable by the FDA as manufacturers of certain sterile and non-sterile bulk antibiotics.  Such FDA classification, subject to compliance with applicable FDA rules, allows imports of the products manufactured at these facilities into the U.S. market and into most European markets.  (See "Information Applicable To All Business Segments - Environmental Compliance" for a discussion of environmental matters related to the Copenhagen, Oslo and Budapest facilities and "Government Regulation - FDA Compliance" for a discussion of the Company's FDA inspection results at the same three facilities.)  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M96"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition.  </I>In sales to large and small customers, price, quality and service are the determining factors.  The Company believes that its fermentation and purification expertise and established reputation provide it with a significant advantage in these antibiotic products.  Competition has increased in recent years on certain of its products, most notably from Asian-based companies.  API's principal competitors are: Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Xinxhang-Zheijiang, Sandoz (LEK), Teva (Biogal), World Yanghen, Shanghai Pioneed and Livzon - Fuzhou.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M97"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic Markets.</I>  The Company's API business sells its products in the U.S. and other areas of the world.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, sales in North America of API products represented approximately 52% of the Company's API business' total revenues. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M98"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers.  </I>Sales of API products are dependent on finished product sales, which are under the control of the Company's customers.  Sales of bulk antibiotic products are made to relatively few large customers, primarily pharmaceutical companies making generics and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  The Company distributes and sells its API products in North America and Europe using its own sales force.  Sales of the Company's API products in other parts of the world are made primarily through local agents and distributors. </FONT><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#ffffff"> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal drugs must be reviewed and receive registration from the FDA for marketing in the United States and approval or registration by similar regulatory agencies in other countries.  Regulatory approvals for products to be used in food producing animals are complex due to the possible impact on humans. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M152"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval also must be granted in the U.S. for the use of an animal drug in combination with other animal drugs in feeds.  Such combination approval generally requires the cooperation of other manufacturers to consent to authorize the FDA to refer to such manufacturer's New Animal Drug Application (or NADA) in <A NAME="_DV_M153"></A>support of the Company's regulatory submissions.  This consent is necessary to obtain approval from the FDA for more than one animal drug to be included in a given animal drug animal feed at the same time.  To date, the Company has been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many of its products.  Generally, the Company does not enter into written agreements with other manufacturers and does not pay any money to other manufacturers to obtain such consent.  These combination clearances significantly extend the reach and potential market share of the Company's p
roducts and provide a considerable competitive advantage.  Presently, the Company has sponsored a total of approximately 100 combination approvals in the U.S.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M154"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions and Divestitures</I>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2004, in order to relieve itself of future obligations for certain payments, the Company entered into an agreement with Natinco N.V., the licensor of certain technology related to Reporcin, a product intended to improve meat quality, which substantially limited the geographic area in which the Company can market the product.   While at the 1999 purchase of the rights to manufacture and market Reporcin, it was the Company's intent to build a global market for the product, sales have not been material to the AH business and the Company intends to discontinue sales once product presently in inventory has been sold.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2004, the Company sold assets relating to its Aquatic Animal Health Business to the senior management of the business for approximately $4.4 million. In connection with this transaction, AH received a final earn-out payment in December 2006 of approximately $1.9 million.  Additionally, in March 2004, the Company sold its AH distribution company to IVS Animal Health Inc. for approximately $17.0 million.<A NAME="_DV_M156"></A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M157"></A> <A NAME="_DV_M158"></A><I>Facilities. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">      </I>The Company produces its Animal Health products in several manufacturing facilities.  BMD is produced and blended at the Company's Chicago Heights, Illinois facility, which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant.  Albac is manufactured at the Oslo, Norway facility, which is managed by API.  AH has entered into agreements, which are subject to Chinese regulatory approval, to purchase two facilities in China.  It intends to move the manufacturing of Albac to one of these facilities and to formulate certain other products at the second facility. The majority of soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH's Longmont, Colorado facility. Feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH's Willow Island, West Virginia facility in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers.  It is then blended at either Company-owned or independent blending facilities.  In 2004, the Company received FDA approval to commence manufacturing lasalocid sodium at its Willow Island fac
ility for sales in the U.S.  Now, in addition to manufacturing chlortetracycline, the Willow Island facility also produces lasalocid for use in the U.S. as well as many other parts of the world. Bio-Cox is blended in AH's Van Buren, Arkansas facility, as well as at a third-party location, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at the Salisbury, Maryland facility, as well as at a third-party location.  The 3-Nitro product line <A NAME="_DV_M159"></A>is manufactured using the Company's technology at a third-party facility.   Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured, using the Company's technology, at a facility owned and operated by a third-party.  In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved from the Company's Lowell, Arkansas facility to the Company's Chicago Heights facility.  Process improvement and manufacturing development is done primarily at AH's Chicago Heights and Willow Island facilities.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Company makes significant use of third-party facilities (some of which are in low-cost countries) in the manufacture of its AH products and anticipates that this use will continue to increase in the future.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M161"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition.  </I>The Company competes in a highly competitive market on the basis of brand name customer service, and price.  Some of the Company's competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities.  Some of AH's principal competitors include Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco), Pennfield and Phibro Animal Health.   Due to the Company's strong market position in MFAs and its experience in obtaining requisite FDA approvals for combination claims, the Company believes it enjoys a competitive advantage in marketing MFAs under the FDA approved combination clearances.  However, no assurances can be given that third parties will continue to cooperate in seeking combination approval for the Company's products, and the Company continues to expect additional new entrants in the generics medicated animal feed additive market in the foreseeable future. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M162"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic Markets.  </I>The Company sells more than half of its animal health products in the U.S. and has a growing presence in Europe, Latin America and Asia. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M163"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers.  </I>The Company's animal health products in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other selected markets are sold through a staff of approximately 100 technically trained sales and technical service and marketing employees, many of whom are veterinarians and nutritionists.  The Company has sales offices in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Thailand, China, Brazil, France and Belgium.  In the remainder of the world, AH's products are sold primarily through the use of distributors and sales companies. <A NAME="_DV_M166"></A>Sales are made principally to commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and integrated cattle, swine and poultry producers.  Although AH is not dependent on any one customer, the customer base for AH products is in a consolidation phase.  Therefore, as consolidation continues, the Company may become more dependent on certain individual customers as these cu
stomers increase their size and market share.     </P>

The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Pharmaceuticals, API and AH products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other government agencies and by comparable authorities in the EU, Norway and other countries.  Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is a member of the European Economic Area and, as such, has accepted all EU regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals.  Government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, civi

The cost of complying with government regulations substantially increases the cost of producing the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements (including the possibility of future changes in statutes or regulations), the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and analogous state and foreign agencies, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time the Company will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite the Company's efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements.  As a result of actions the Company has taken to respond to the progressively more demanding regulatory environment in which the Company operates, the Company has spent, and will continue to spend, significant funds and management time on regulatory compliance. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Product Marketing Authority and Protection from Generic Competition</I>.  KADIAN is the subject of an approved New Drug Application, or NDA, which has been reviewed by the FDA for both safety and effectiveness. The Agency has the continuing authority to consider the safety and effectiveness of all drugs subject to an approved NDA and, in appropriate circumstances, to order labeling changes, changes in or restrictions upon the drug's use or a cessation of the drug's sale and marketing.  (See "Risk Factors - The FDA is considering the potential effects of KADIAN if taken with alcohol".)  Third parties may offer a generic variation of a branded product that is the subject of an NDA if the genericproduct is the subject of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, and be approved by the FDA prior to marketing.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All applications for regulatory approval of generic drug products subject to ANDA requirements must contain data relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and quality control, among other information.  ANDAs also must contain data demonstrating the bioequivalence of the generic drug to the branded drug.  In addition to meeting the above requirements for an ANDA, a generic version of KADIAN will not be approved by the FDA until the earlier of the expiration of the last to expire Orange Book (the FDA publication that lists, among others, patents protecting the active ingredient, formulation, and methods of use of a drug product) patents applicable to KADIAN (March 23, 2010 and April 13, 2010) or the date upon which a third-party is able to demonstrate in the manner provided by law that either the Company's KADIAN patents are invalid or the generic equivalent product does not infringe the KADIAN patents.  Under the Hatch-
Waxman Act, which amended both the Patent Code and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, procedures were codified and expanded with respect to applications for obtaining FDA approval for generic versions of patented drugs; including the institution of a statutory 30-month stay on the FDA authority to issue an ANDA commencing from the date a patent holder files a lawsuit challenging the generic applicants assertion of brand patent invalidity or non-infringement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Most of the Company's animal health products are regulated by the FDA or equivalent regulatory authorities around the world, similarly to the human pharmaceuticals, while other animal health products are regulated primarily by individual States.  Although the Company markets some generic animal drug products that are subject to FDA requirements similar to those as applicable to its human generic pharmaceutical products, many of its animal drug products are considered to be branded or pioneer animal drug products.  Like their human counterparts, pre-marketing approval under stringent FDA rules for their testing, development, and manufacture is required for animal drugs, as well as for any changes in label claims, specifications or manufacturing sites that occur post-approval.  The passage of the Animal Drug User Fee Act in late 2003 and its successful implementation by the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine has made review times more predictable; however changing regulatory requireme
nts and policies continue to make the timing of such approvals difficult to predict. Despite the difficulty and delays brought about by this situation, the Company has been successful in obtaining such approvals.  As with human pharmaceutical products, FDA inspection and record keeping requirements as well as debarment provisions apply to the Company's animal health products.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative bills are introduced in the U.S. Congress and individual states from time to time, some of which, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on AH's business.

The animal health industry is actively engaged in the legislative process.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>EU Product Marketing Authority.</I>  EU legislation requires that veterinary products used for medicinal purposes must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the EU.  The criteria upon which grant of an authorization is assessed are quality, safety and efficacy.  Demonstration of safety and efficacy in particular requires clinical trials, which are subject to the standards codified in the EU guideline on Good Clinical Practice; however certain countries granted membership in the EU as of May 1, 2004 may, until a given date specified for each country, individually authorize the continued marketing of products that do not qualify for marketing authorization under EU law if such products were approved by the individual country prior to being granted EU membership.  Analogous governmental and agency approvals are required in other countries where the Company conducts business.  If the Company fails to obtain such marketing authorizations, or fails 
to obtain them in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's AH business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic medicinal products for veterinary use may be authorized in the EU through abridged authorization applications.  For example, the EU marketing authorization applications do not need to contain results of tests and results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, provided that certain conditions are met, and, in particular, that the "original" medicinal product has been authorized in the EU for not less than 8 years in a Member State of the Community.  A generic veterinary medicinal product authorized pursuant to the abridged procedure may not be placed on the market until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product.  This 10-year period may be extended to 13 years in the case of veterinary medicinal products for fish or bees or other species designated following certain requirements.  To qualify for abridged dossiers, the product must be considered to be a generic of a reference medicinal product.  A generic medicinal product is a medicinal p
roduct which has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances, the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, and whose bioequivalence to the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate studies.  Different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, or derivatives of an active substance are considered to be the same active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with respect to safety and/or efficacy.  In such cases, additional information demonstrating the safety and/or efficacy of the various salts, esters, or, derivatives of an authorized substance must be supplied by the applicant.  However, results of safety and residue tests or pre-clinical tests or clinical trials are not required if the applicant can demonstrate that the active substances of the veterinary medicinal product have been in well-established veterinary use within the EU for at least 10 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable le
vel of safety.  If the Company fails to satisfy the conditions for the use of abridged authorization applications for new products being developed by the Company, the process for the approval of such products could take significantly longer and cost substantially more to the Company.   generic feed additive products in the EU used to promote animal health (specifically anticoccidial products) and nutrition are regulated under different legislation than veterinary pharmaceuticals (Regulation 1831/2003).  Applications for generic feed additives require the same types of data necessary to obtain authorization of the original product.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Union and a number of  non-EU countries banned the use of four antibiotics to promote growth in food producing animals effective July 1, 1999, and extended this ban to the remaining approved growth- promoting antibiotics effective on January 1, 2006.  In the list of products banned in 1999, only one, bacitracin zinc, was manufactured and marketed by the Company.  The Company's attempt to reverse or limit the EU ban that affects the Company's Albac product was not successful. Similar actions to ban or severely restrict the use in animals of antibiotics have been taken by EU trading partners or are being contemplated. (See "Risk Factors - An expansion of the ban of the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals could result in a decrease in the Company's total sales".).

There are similar cGMP regulations in other countries where the Company has manufacturing operations.  The approvals held by the Company's customers (i.e., the manufacturers of the finished antibiotic products) identify the Company facilities that are permitted to supply APIs under each specific app
roval.  The Company's facilities that produce for export to the U.S. are required to be registered with FDA as drug establishments and each API exported to the U.S. must be the subject of a drug listing.  The Company is subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The EU requires that before a medicinal product can be manufactured and assembled, each company that carries out such an operation must hold a manufacturer's license and the manufacture and assembly must be in accordance with the marketing authorization and cGMP.  It also requires that active substances used in medicinal products for human and veterinary use be manufactured following EU guidelines on good manufacturing practice.  The EU follows the same international guidance with respect to cGMPs for APIs as the FDA.  In addition, the EU has expanded its ability to conduct cGMP inspections of active substance manufacturers.  The EU cGMP guidelines do not affect the ability of the responsible national competent authorities to establish specific registration requirements regarding active substances regarding active substances manufactured and/or marketed as such in their territory. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     While the Elizabeth, New Jersey plant is a part of the Discontinued Operations and is no longer the direct responsibility of the Company, its regulatory status continues to be important to the Company since it is the location where KADIAN is manufactured.  Between November 2002 and January 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the FDA issued inspection observations listing deviations from cGMP's (a "483 Report") on January 15, 2003.  A comprehensive response was submitted on February 5, 2003. The FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report citing continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations.   The Company was informed that the FDA performed a cGMP inspection at the Elizabeth plant during 2006.  The Company understands that the inspection did not result in Actavis' inability to manufacture KADIAN.  However, the details of the inspection and the discussions between Ac
tavis and the FDA are not publicly available.  (See "An interruption in the supply of KADIAN would be materially adverse to the Company's operations" under Risk Factors).  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In October 2004, May 2005 and September 2005, the Company received 483 Reports with respect to its API facilities in Oslo, Norway, Copenhagen, Denmark and Budapest, Hungary, respectively, that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs.  The Company responded to the FDA and the FDA determined that all three responses were satisfactory.  As a result, all three facilities have the right to manufacture products for sale in the United States.  The Company has received 483 Reports from time to time in the past for it U.S. AH plants, all of which the Company believes it has adequately addressed.  The Company received no 483 Reports in 2006 for its API and AH plants.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential Liability for Current Products</I>.  Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products, including the Company's products, and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.  While the Company believes that it is unlikely that an adverse finding in any single study regarding any of the Company's products will result in such regulatory measures without further findings, publicity raised by such a study could cause some of the Company's customers to decrease or stop their use of such product, resulting in an adverse aff

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlled Substances Act</I>.  The Company developed, and sells KADIAN which is a "controlled substance", as defined in the Controlled Substances Act.  The Controlled Substance Act establishes certain security, personnel, reporting, record keeping and import and export requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), a division of the Department of Justice.  The Company is registered by the DEA to distribute controlled substances; Actavis, the toll manufacturer of KADIAN, holds the DEA registration to manufacture KADIAN.  The DEA has a dual mission: law enforcement and regulation. The DEA deals with the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them.  The DEA shares enforcement authority with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another division of the Department of Justice.  The DEA's regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed handlers of controlled substances, and with the substances 
themselves, equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent such articles from being diverted into illicit channels of commerce.  The Company is not under any restrictions for noncompliance with the foregoing regulations, but there can be no assurance that restrictions or fines will not be imposed on the Company in the future.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Care Reimbursement</I>.  The methods and level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, including KADIAN, under Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic reimbursement programs are the subject of constant review by state and federal governments and private third-party payers like insurance companies.  The Company believes that U.S. government agencies will continue to review and assess alternative payment methodologies and reform measures designed to reduce the cost of drugs to the public.  As a part of this effort, the federal government and several states and local jurisdictions have commenced administrative or court actions challenging the pricing practices of certain named drug manufacturers including the Company.  Because the outcome of these and other health care reform initiatives is uncertain, the Company cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">&#9;</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>    The Medicaid Drug Rebate legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to sign a rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service (the HHS). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( the CMS). The drug rebate program was amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the VHCA). Under the VHCA, drug manufacturers are also required to enter a pricing agreement with HHS for the Section 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (the HRSA). In addition, the VHCA requires drug manufacturers to enter into various agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Company is a participant in all these Federal programs. The VA's purchasing power may create pricing pressure which could offset any potential increase in sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    Under current law, all pharmaceutical manufacturers must rebate to state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's price based on sales of outpatient drug products reimbursed under state Medicaid programs.  The required rebate rate for manufacturers of brand products is currently the greater of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) per unit to the retail pharmacy class of trade for each product at the unit level or the difference between the AMP and the Company's best price, as adjusted by the CPI-U based on launch date and current quarter AMP to any non-governmental customer. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, effective on January 1, 2006, the federal government began providing a prescription drug benefit to plan beneficiaries under Medicare Part D.  It is difficult to predict the impact the Medicare prescription drug coverage benefit will have on pharmaceutical companies. Usage of pharmaceuticals may increase as a result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. The drug benefit is administered by private sector plan sponsors who are responsible for negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain favorable pricing on behalf of plan beneficiaries.  As a result, the purchasing power of plan sponsors may create pricing pressure which could offset any potential increase in sales.  </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    <FONT SIZE=3>The Company continues to participate in CMS-approved State Pharmacy Assistance Programs ("SPAP"). Most of SPAP patients are currently covered by Medicare Part D.

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's reports filed from time to time pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, include certain forward-looking statements.  Like any company subject to a competitive and changing business environment, the Company cannot guarantee the results predicted in any of the Company's forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Company depends on the development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's future success is largely dependent upon its ability to develop, manufacture and market commercially successful new products.  Generally, the successful commercial marketing of the Company's products depends on completing the following steps in a time frame to allow the Company to be among the first to market a particular product:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>developing and testing the product;</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>proving that the product is safe and effective; and </LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>filing for and receiving regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell the product in a timely manner.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delays in the development, manufacture or marketing of new products will impact the Company's expenses and revenues.  The Company cannot be sure that any product presently going through the process set forth above, or which may be chosen by the Company to enter this process in the future, will result in the timely and profitable commercial launch of a new product. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, in its continuing businesses, expended approximately $44.4 million and $26.9 million on research and development efforts in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and expects to increase these expenditures by approximately $30 to $35 million in 2007, principally for the development of additional products in Pharmaceuticals. Such research and development expenditures will reduce the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products, including a new pain product, which prove to be economically successful.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is subject to government regulations and actions that increase the Company's costs and could prevent it from marketing and selling some of its products in certain countries.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, record keeping, pricing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  While the Company does not keep records that segregate the cost of compliance with these government regulations, in the aggregate such regulations substantially increase the cost of manufacturing, developing and selling the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations, including API's plants in Oslo, Copenhagen and Budapest and AH's plants in Oslo and the US, where products for the U.S. market are, or are intended to be, manufactured.  These reviews have in the past and may in the future result in regulatory concerns requiring a response by the Company.  Failure to adequately address these concerns could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including product approval delays, reduced production and production interruptions, among other things.  The significance of the effect of any such failures depends on the severity of the remedy chosen by the government agency.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production or distribution and debarment of individuals from providing services to drug companies in any capacity or debarment of the Company from obtaining new drug approv
als, resulting in current charges to income and the potential for future loss of income and increased operating expenses.  In recent years, besides stepped up enforcement of cGMP requirements, the federal government has utilized equitable disgorgement as a means of enforcing compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations.  There can be no assurance that the FDA would not seek to impose similar sanctions on the Company and any such sanction could have a significant effect on the Company's business and operations.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are continually being conducted by the industry, government agencies (including studies required to be performed from time to time by the pharmaceutical company marketing a particular drug) and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ more sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the safety and efficacy of currently marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An expansion of the ban of the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals could result in a decrease in the Company's total sales.</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=3>The issue of the potential transfer of increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals to human pathogens is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals.  While most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that the Company offers for sale, the European Union and a number of non-EU countries, including Norway and Turkey, banned the use of bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic growth promoter manufactured by the Company and others that has been used in livestock feeds for over 40 years, as a feed additive growth promoter.  The Company has not sold this product as a feed additive growth promoter in these countries since the bans took effect (initially in the EU in July 1999, in Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, (the latter two now part of the
 EU) in 2000, and in Norway in January 2006). The EU ban is based upon the "Precautionary Principle", which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by scientific certainty.  Although the EU and non-EU actions negatively impacted the Company's business, they were not material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban will be expanded.  If any one of the following occur: (i) the EU, countries within or outside the EU or meat importers act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based products, (ii) there is an expansion of the zinc bacitracin ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products, (iii) a similar ban is instituted relating to other antibiotic feed additives sold by the Company in the U.S. or in one or more other countries where the Company has material sales, or (iv) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the Company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  The Company cannot predict whether this antibiotic resistance concern will result in expanded regulations or public pressure 
adversely affecting other antibiotic-based animal health products previously sold by the Company in the jurisdictions where the ban has been imposed or in other countries in which those products are presently sold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions of the antibiotic resistance issue continue actively in the U.S.  Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse human effects from the use of antibiotics in food animals.  Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company's customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics.  In July 2005, the FDA announced a restriction on the distribution and use of a medicated feed additive due to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance in humans.  While the Company does not market this drug, this ruling would be significant if its conclusions were expanded to the medicated feed additives sold by the Company.  It is uncertain what additional actions, if any, the FDA may take for approved animal drug products.  However, the FDA has established a rating system to be used to compare the risks associated with the use of specific antibiotic products in food producing animal
s, including those sold by the Company.  While the Company does not believe that the presently proposed risk assessment system would be materially adverse to its business, it is subject to change prior to adoption or to later amendment.  The sales of the Company's AH segment are principally antibiotic-based products for use with food producing animals; therefore, the future loss of major markets, including the U.S., or negative publicity regarding this use of antibiotic based products, could have a negative impact on the Company's sales and income.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Potential adverse effects on human health linked to the raising or consumption of food producing animals using the Company's products could result in a decrease in the Company's sales. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the government find, or the public perceive, a risk to human health from consumption of food producing animals which utilize the Company's products (such as Avian flu) or as a by-product to the raising of such animals (such as the "Chicken Litter" litigation referred to in Item 3 of this Report), there may be a decline in either the sale of such food products, which would result in a decrease in the use of the Company's products, or a decrease in the use of the Company's products in the growing of such food producing animals. </P>
</FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the third parties with whom the Company does business depend on government approvals, and the failure to maintain these approvals could affect the supply of materials to the Company, hinder the Company's ability to license products, or affect the promotion, distribution or sale of the Company's products.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has affiliations, license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory approvals sought by such third parties. The Company's vendors and third-party contract manufacturers, including Actavis, currently the sole source of supply for KADIAN, are subject to regulatory compliance similar to those described herein with respect to the Company.  If any one of these third parties is found to have significant regulatory violations, the Company could be materially negatively impacted if such violations result in an interruption of the supply of a product which relates to material Company sales. While the Company takes measures where economically feasible and available to secure back-up suppliers, many of the Company's products come from a sole source supplier. There can be no assurance that such contingency plans will be able to provide adequate and timely product to eliminate any threat of interruption of supply of the 
Company's products to its customers or that these problems will not otherwise materially impact the Company's business.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=3>See "An interruption in the supply of KADIAN would be materially adverse to the Company's operations" below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interruption in the supply of the Company's raw materials or products or an adverse event at one of the Company's manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturing facilities could adversely affect the Company's operations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently purchases many of its raw materials and a number of its finished products from single suppliers and many of its products are manufactured at a single facility; including KADIAN, which is manufactured by Actavis at its Elizabeth, New Jersey facility. While the Company relies on single source suppliers for many of its raw materials and for a number of its finished products, it relies on different suppliers for different raw materials and finished products. Any interruption in the supply of these materials or products or an adverse event at the facilities that manufacture and blend the Company's products, could decrease sales of the affected products. In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials or products or to lease or purchase new manufacturing facilities. The Company may be unable to find a third-party willing or able to provide the necessary products or facilities suitabl
e for manufacturing pharmaceuticals on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company had to obtain substitute materials or products, the Company would require additional regulatory approvals, as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer. The use of new facilities, similarly, would require regulatory approvals. Any significant interruption of supply from the Company's sole source raw material suppliers or third-party manufacturing facilities that are related to products that generate more than $5.0 million in gross profits or any adverse event at any of its manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Five raw materials used in Company products that each generated more than $5.0 million in gross profits in 2006 came from sole source suppliers. The sole source suppliers that provided these raw materials were: Bayer Crop Science, Cambrex Corporation, DSM Fine Chemicals Inc., Kaken Pharmaceuticals Co, Ltd, and Second Pharma Co.
, Ltd (formerly Beijing #2). Additionally, four finished product sole source suppliers supplied finished products generating more than $5.0 million in gross profits in 2006 including Actavis, the supplier of KADIAN. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interruption in the supply of KADIAN would be materially adverse to the Company's operations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant Company product manufactured by a third-party is KADIAN, which is manufactured under a toll manufacturing agreement with the Company's former genericsubsidiary sold to Actavis as a part of the Generics Business transaction.   While the Company is using reasonable commercial efforts to locate a second source for the manufacture of KADIAN, Actavis is, at present, its sole supplier.  Actavis has, in the past, had certain FDA regulatory issues at the plant where KADIAN is manufactured, including a Form 483 issued during 2006.  In addition, the Company no longer controls the Elizabeth plant of Actavis and it can no longer require that KADIAN manufacturing be given any particular priority when compared with the products manufactured for Actavis' own sales.  Any interruption in the supply of KADIAN would have a material adverse effect on the Company.  This effect could be particularly severe since many patients acclimate to the brand of pain 
product which they are using and, as a result, forcing a KADIAN user to switch to a competitive product could cause a reluctance of that individual to resume his or her use of KADIAN once supplies of the product were again available, as well as potentially cause some physicians to favor competitive products for new patients.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A delay in or the failure to launch KADIAN NT could be materially adverse to the Company's operations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Two significant patents on the Company's KADIAN product will expire in 2010 and the other patent will expire in 2011, although patent protection may be lost at an earlier date under certain circumstances. (See "The Company's branded drug product, KADIAN, may experience general generic competition" below). Pharmaceuticals has commenced Phase III activities on a new abuse resistant form of KADIAN ("KADIAN NT") which the Company intends to offer as an alternative to KADIAN prior to expiration of the patents.  Assuming a successful Phase III outcome, the Company is targeting an NDA filing in the first half of 2008.  A failure of the Phase III studies or a delay in the timing of the Phase III activities could cancel or delay the NDA filing and the launch of this abuse resistant form of KADIAN.  </FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">  </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A material portion of the Company's sales and gross profits is dependent on a relatively small number of products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven products (Pharmaceuticals' KADIAN, AH's CTC, BMD and Lacalocid and API's vancomycin, polymyxin and bacitracin) in the aggregate constituted approximately 75% of the Company's 2006 sales and gross profits.  The loss of significant sales of any one or more of such products for any reason, including any of the risks related to such products described in this Report, would have a material adverse effect upon the Company.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's international operations are subject to additional economic and political risks.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's international operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions, political instability in some countries, and uncertainty as to the enforceability of, and government control over, commercial rights. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company sells its AH and API products in many countries that are susceptible to significant foreign currency fluctuations. Sales of the Company's API products are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, eliminating the direct  exposure to currency fluctuations, but increasing credit risk if the local currency devalues significantly and it becomes more expensive for customers to purchase U.S. dollars required to pay the Company.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
In all the Company's businesses, it may become more difficult for the Company to respond to competitive challenges because of its size and product mix and the rapidly changing market.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industries in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive and many of the Company's competitors are affiliated with entities which are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company possesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain countries, because of the Company's size and product mix, the Company may not be able to capitalize on changes in competition and pricing as fully as the Company's competitors.  In recent years, have been new entrants in the generic medicated animal feed additive market, particularly in the United States.  Additionally, the Company's API business may be subject to increased competitive challenges, particularly with respect to those products for which the Company implemented significant price increases during 2003.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's branded drug product, KADIAN, may experience general genericcompetition</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's branded drug product line may face challenges from genericcompetitors.  The Company has three patents that cover KADIAN (expiring in either 2010 or 2011), two of which could be subject to paragraph IV challenges prior to their expiration date, though there have been no such challenges to date.   The Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be able to successfully defend its patent position or utilize the statutory 30-month stay on FDA approval of the generic ANDA, since either result is dependent upon the Company being able to meet the statutory requirements for filing a lawsuit challenging the generic product based upon a bona fide belief that the generic product infringes one or more of the KADIAN patents.  The existence of such belief cannot be determined until the Company has the opportunity to review the relevant paragraph IV filing.  Upon entry of a  generic equivalent in the market, the Company's branded product could lose substanti
al sales and the price could materially decline.</P>
<B>
<P>The Company's </FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" SIZE=3>products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents.<U>  </P>
</B></U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    Certain of the Company's products, including its abuse deterrent technology, are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents. As a result, other companies may hold patents which may be used to challenge the Company's freedom to manufacture and sell its products in the relevant jurisdictions.  If such challenges are successful, the Company may be prevented from selling its products or required to license relevant patents and pay significant fees or royalties to third parties.  Licenses may not be available on favorable terms to the Company.  Alternatively, the Company may have to defend an infringement action and challenge the validity of third-party patents in court, a costly and time consuming process.  The defense of such suits could result in unfavorable outcomes or could cause the Company to abandon its defense of such a suit and abandon and withdraw the relevant product(s). If the Company does not obtain a license in such a case, or if it is found liab
le for infringement and is unable to have such patents declared invalid or unenforceable, the Company may be liable for significant monetary damages, may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market, or may be precluded from manufacturing, using, or selling these products. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's policies regarding sales returns, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers and other customers, may reduce the Company's revenue in future fiscal periods.</B>  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on industry practice in the U.S., brand manufacturers such as the Company have return policies, rebates paid to commercial and government entities in connection with sales made to enrollees in certain health plans, and chargebacks to wholesale customers in connection with sales they make to certain categories of customers, such as hospitals or group purchasing organizations.  Although the Company establishes reserves based upon its prior experience and certain other information which reflect the Company's best estimate of the impact that these policies will have in subsequent periods, actual results could differ from these estimates and impact the Company's financial results. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's liability from accidents, product liability or other claims may exceed the Company's insurance coverage.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company seeks to obtain liability and direct damage insurance to protect it from liability due to accidents, product liability and other claims that arise in the course of doing business. While, based upon historical claims levels, the Company believes its present insurance is adequate for current and projected operations, insurance that the Company seeks to obtain in the future to protect itself against these potential liabilities may be inadequate, unobtainable or prohibitively expensive.  A materially adverse result in the AH litigation relating to its 3-Nitro product (See "Legal Proceedings - Chicken Litter Litigation") could result in insurance coverage which is not adequate to cover the risk of that litigation or future lawsuits. The Company is subject to renewal of most of its insurance policies each year and changes are anticipated at each renewal. In recent years, the Company has experienced increases in its insurance costs and certain coverag
e reductions, including coverage exclusions pertaining to 3-Nitro and certain other products that it now manufacturers or may manufacture in the future. The Company's inability to obtain and maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to pursue product-specific licensing, marketing agreements, co-development opportunities and other partnering arrangements.  The Company may also pursue selective product and company acquisitions.  The Company cannot be sure that it will be able to locate suitable partners for these transactions.  In addition, assuming the Company identifies suitable partners, the process of effectively entering into these arrangements involves risks that the Company's management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns and that the Company may have difficulty integrating the new arrangements into its existing business.  In addition, certain transactions could adversely impact earnings as the Company incurs development and other expenses related to the transactions and the Company could incur debt to complete these transactions.  Debt instruments could contain contractual commitments and covenants that could adversely affect the Company'
s cash flow and its ability to operate its business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Non-compliance with environmental waste discharge regulations could adversely affect production at two European plants of the Company. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the environmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Copenhagen and Oslo API manufacturing facilities gave the Company notice of revised waste discharge levels. The Company believes it has taken the actions necessary to comply with the requirements, including certain plant alterations and modifications at a cost not material to the Company.  The environmental authorities have not yet confirmed whether the Company's actions are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, in 2006 a criminal fine was levied against the Company's Oslo API facility based on allegations that certain of the discharge activities at the facility were in breach of applicable regulations.  The Company is in discussions with the local authorities regarding this fine. The failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations could result in further criminal or civil actions affecting production at these facilities which could be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<P><BR>
A <B>loss of members of the Company's senior management team  and other highly qualified employees could adversely affect the Company's business. </P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    The Company's success is dependent on attracting and retaining highly qualified management, scientific and sales personnel. The strategic change in the Company and the relocation of the Company's headquarters could impact the Company's ability to retain key employees. The loss of key personnel, or the Company's failure to attract and retain highly skilled employees in a timely fashion, could adversely impact the implementation of its business strategy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Past restatements of the Company's financial statements and certain matters related to internal controls may present a risk of future restatements and lead to an inability to report on the financial status of the Company on a timely and fair basis. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2005, the Company revised its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 to disaggregate its U.S. Generics Pharmaceuticals (USG) and Branded Pharmaceuticals (BP) businesses as separate reportable segments.  In May 2005, the Company revised its 2004 financial statements to change the classification of certain of its outstanding debt as current liabilities and to amend disclosures related to the Company's compliance with certain of its debt covenants at December 31, 2004 and 2003. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has made significant investments to enable it to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act").  Compliance with Section 404 of the Act was first required as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.  The Company has undergone a significant effort to document, test, and assess its internal controls.  At December 31, 2004, the Company identified four material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting: (i) ineffective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts at the Company's USG business; (ii) ineffective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax accounts, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes payable and income tax expense; (iii) ineffective internal controls over the determination of proper segment disclosures; and (iv) ineffective controls to ensure the appropriate review and monitoring of its complian
ce with certain of its debt covenants.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the Company implemented actions to remediate the four material weaknesses identified at December 31, 2004. The Company believes the actions it took in 2005 and the enhanced control procedures it implemented served to remediate the four material weaknesses identified at December 31, 2004.  However, at December 31, 2005, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting for income taxes related specifically to the timeliness and accuracy of tax accounting related to the disposition of the Generics Business and related fourth quarter transactions.  In addition, management identified, and developed remediation plans to address certain other control deficiencies which were not material weaknesses at December 31, 2005.  During 2006, the Company took actions and remediated the material weakness related to the financial reporting for income taxes.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Management performed an assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, utilizing the criteria described in the "Internal Control- Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").  Based on that assessment, the Company concluded that, at December 31, 2006, its internal control over financial reporting was effective. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">       </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In future years, there are no assurances that the Company will not have material weaknesses  that would be required to be reported or that the Company will be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Act. A significant material weakness or the failure to meet the requirements of Section 404 could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements. </P>

<B><P>Item 3. Legal Proceedings </P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, of a nature considered normal to its business.  It is the Company's policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of the Company, although the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with the following legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SEC Investigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements. The SEC has engaged in deposition and document discovery.  </P>

<B><P>Chicken Litter Litigation</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is one of multiple defendants that have been named in several lawsuits which allege that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce manure that contains an arsenical compound which, when used as agricultural fertilizer by chicken farmers, degrades into inorganic arsenic and causes a variety of diseases in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields).  The Company has provided notice to its insurance carriers and its primary insurance carriers have responded by accepting their obligations to defend or pay the Company's defense costs, subject to reservation of rights to later reject coverage for these lawsuits.  In addition, one of the Company's carriers has filed a Declaratory Judgment action in state court in which it has sought a ruling concerning the allocation of its coverage obligations to the Company among the Company's several insurance carriers and, to the extent the Company does not have full insurance c
overage, to the Company.  In addition, this Declaratory Judgment action requests that the Court rule that certain of the carrier's policies provide no coverage because certain policy exclusions allegedly operate to limit its coverage obligations under said policies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the approximately 175 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are asking for punitive damages and requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue.   In September 2006, in the first trial, which was brought by two plaintiffs, the Circuit Court of Washington County, Arkansas, Second Division, entered a jury verdict in favor of the Company.  The plaintiffs are appealing the verdict.  The court has ruled that future trials are on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. While the Company can give no assurance of the outcome of these matters, it believes that it will be able to continue to present credible scientific evidence that its product is not the cause of any injuries the plaintiffs may have suffered.  There is also the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in these lawsuits, as well as additional lawsuits in other jurisdictions where the product has b
een sold.  Worldwide sales of this product were approximately $23.3 million in 2004, $23.1 million in 2005 and $22.2 million in 2006.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brazilian Tax Claims</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the subject of tax claims by the Brazilian authorities relating to sales and import taxes which aggregate approximately $10.0 million.  The claims relate to the operations of the Company's AH business in Brazil since 1999. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its position against these claims.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Environmental Regulations</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  <FONT SIZE=3>During 2005, the environmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Copenhagen and Oslo API manufacturing facilities gave the Company notice of revised waste discharge levels. The Company believes it has taken the actions necessary to comply with the requirements, including certain plant alterations and modifications at a cost not material to the Company.  The environmental authorities have not yet confirmed whether the Company's actions are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, in 2006 a criminal fine was levied against the Company's Oslo API facility based on allegations that certain of the discharge activities at the facility were in breach of applicable regulations.  The Company is in discussions with the local authorities regarding this fine. The failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations could result in further criminal or civil actions affecting production at these facilities which could be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information Request</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     </B>On February 28, 2007, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain documents relating to KADIAN.  The subpoena did not disclose any allegations underlying this request.  The Company intends to cooperate with the Department.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Other Commercial Disputes</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any further responsibility for substantially all of the material contingent liabilities related to the Generics Business have has been transferred to Actavis or entities owned by Actavis, subject to certain representations or warranties made by the Company to Actavis as a part of the transaction to the extent such representations and warranties were incorrect.  The Company has retained certain specified liabilities which it believes are not material to the Company and, it is possible that the Company may be held responsible for certain liabilities of the Generics Business transferred to Actavis in the event Actavis fails or is unable to satisfy such liabilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Litigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business.  It is the view of management, after consultation with counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all other pending suits on an individual basis should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><FONT SIZE=3>Pharmaceuticals markets one branded pharmaceutical prescription product, a pain medication sold under the trademark KADIAN, in the U.S. that is contract manufactured by a third-party.  Pharmaceuticals is currently focused on the pain management market in the United States.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, Pharmaceuticals had product sales of $138.2 million and operating income of $28.3 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pharmaceuticals realizes significant gross profit margins on its sales of KADIAN; but competes in a highly competitive market, and is subject to potential challenges from generic equivalents.  The Company's business plan includes significant investments in research and development spending associated with the development of a next-generation pain product with abuse deterrent characteristics.  Pharmaceuticals has experienced improved profitability as a result of a number of factors, including product prescription growth.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The main factors affecting the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) business are:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API markets globally primarily 14 antibiotic API's that are generally used by third-parties in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products.  API realizes strong gross profit margins and has experienced and expects continuing increased global competition on its products and associated pricing pressure.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, API had product sales of $168.7 million and operating income of $51.8 million.  Operating income in 2006 was favorably impacted by a $7.8 million curtailment gain related to freezing a Norwegian defined benefit pension plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<I>The main factors affecting the Animal Health (AH) business are:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's AH business is a global leader in the development, registration, manufacturing and marketing of medicated feed additives ("MFAs") and water soluble vitamin type substances for food producing animals; including poultry, cattle, and swine.  Agricultural markets have historically had low growth rates.  In addition, demand for the Company's products has been and could be reduced by bans or restrictions on the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals.  Material changes in animal production input prices (ie. corn) may have a negative effect on the sales of product.  Significant flock/herd health (avian flu outbreak, BSE etc) may impact the companies sales of product.  AH has increased its revenues and profitability through expanding and enhanced market positions, new products, new indications for existing products, and cost-reduction and other productivity improvement initiatives.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, AH had product sales of $346.9 million and operating in
come of $71.5 million.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The increase in gross profit dollars is the result of increased volumes in all three business segments and favorable price realization in Pharmaceuticals.  The lower gross profit percentage is primarily a result of low margin sales of API products that, in 2005, were reported as sales by the Company's divested Generics Business.  In addition, the decline in gross profit percentage reflects lower gross margins in the API business attributable to lower pricing on certain products and increased costs associated with new product development, geographic expansion, and certain asset write-downs. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH revenues, excluding Wynco and Aquatic revenues in 2004, increased 12.7% due primarily to increased sales in the U.S. livestock market (7.8%) and in the European markets (2.0%).

Excluding these costs, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $23.7 million due primarily to marketing campaigns and sales force expansions within Pharmaceuticals ($15.0 million) and increased costs within the Pharmaceuticals and API segments related to realigning the remaining businesses as a result of the disposal of the Generics Business ($5.3 million).

<B><P>Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes </P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Income taxes for 2005 amounted to a benefit of $18.4 million compared to pre-tax income of $43.8 million.  The net tax benefit is primarily attributable to the removal of a valuation allowance for net U.S. deferred tax assets, offset partially by tax expense of $28.6 million, resulting from repatriating cash in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act.  The tax provision in 2004 was an expense of $49.5 million compared to pre-tax income of $2.7 million, resulting mainly from the establishment of a valuation allowance for net U.S. deferred tax assets.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  At December 31, 2004, the Company had recorded significant U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which it had provided a full valuation allowance given that it was not considered to be "more likely than not" that these deferred tax assets would be realized. At December 31, 2005, the Company made the decision to reverse the remaining valuation allowance because it believed that it was "more likely than not" that these assets would be realized.  The Company's cash flow generated throughout 2005, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Generics Business, enabled the Company to pay off all of its domestic debt by January 23, 2006 which in turn, eliminated related interest expense, thereby increasing future profitability.  In addition, it was e
xpected that the continuing domestic business segments, which had been profitable for the past three years, would continue to be profitable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discontinued Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On December 19, 2005, the Company sold its world-wide human Generics pharmaceutical business (the "Generics Business"), excluding ParMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("ParMed"), its Generics pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution unit, to Actavis Group hf ("Actavis") for cash in the amount of $810 million.  The net cash proceeds from this sale were used to repay all of the Company's outstanding debt, which amounted to $416.7 million at December 31, 2005.  On March 31, 2006, the Company sold ParMed for cash in the amount of $40.1 million.  After completing both of these sales, the Company had no debt and cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2006, amounting to $366.4 million.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     There were no assets and liabilities of discontinued operations at December 31, 2006 and, at December 31, 2005, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations consisted of solely ParMed assets ($17.5 million) and liabilities ($12.1 million) held for sale at that time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Results in 2006 include only the results of operations of ParMed for the three months ended March 31, 2006, prior to its sale on March 31, 2006.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Discontinued Operations reported revenues of $870.2 million and $826.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Gross profit margins improved to 33.3% in 2005, from 28.9% in 2004, primarily a result of increased sales of gabapentin in the U.S. Generics business and costs reductions achieved in the Generics Business through supply chain and other process improvement initiatives.  In 2005, the Discontinued Operations reported operating income of $44.6 million compared with an operating loss of $286.2 million in 2004.  The 2004 operating loss was principally attributable to a $260 million goodwill impairment charge and a $15.5 million facility impairment charge recorded in the U.S. Generics business in 2004.  During the fourth quarter of 2004, a number of factors emerged which impacted the estimated future cash flows of the U.S. Generics business.  These factors included recent experience with new product launches for which pricing was significantly below previous expectations; refle
cting increasing competition, including authorized Generics.  As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2004, estimates for new product launches and the future profitability of the U.S. Generics business were adjusted downward, resulting in declines in projected cash flows and indications of an impairment of the goodwill attributable to the U.S. Generics business.  Based upon preliminary Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 step two valuation work performed by an independent valuation firm, the Company estimated and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $260 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The SFAS No. 142 step two valuation work was finalized in the first quarter of 2005, and the Company recorded an adjustment of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2005, increasing the total U.S. Generics goodwill impairment charge to $260.8 million. </P>

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of inflation on the Company's operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not significant.</P>

<B><U><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. All professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 2006, have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  The Company has chosen to highlight certain policies, which include estimates that it considers critical to the operations of the business and its consolidated financial statements:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Revenue Recognition</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers. The Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment. Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In the Company's Pharmaceuticals and AH businesses, sales to certain customers require that the business remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, discounts, promotional allowances, and other managed-care allowances.  In addition, sales are generally made with limited right of return under certain circumstances.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Provisions for these discounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a reduction of total revenues and amounted to $47.1 million and $38.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Accruals related to these provisions are reflected on the balance sheet and classified as either a direct reduction of accounts receivable or, to the extent that amounts are due to entities other than customers, as accrued expenses.  The reserve balances related to these provisions included in Accounts receivable, net amounted to $6.6 million and $7.5 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The amounts included in Accrued expenses amounted to $17.6 million and $13.5 million, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The most significant of these reserves relates to Medicaid accruals that are recorded as accrued expenses and estimated based upon experience within each state and information obtained from wholesalers regarding inventory level
s.  In the case of Medicaid accruals and all other reserves for discounts, the Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these deductions from revenue by comparison of estimated amounts to actual experience. Operating results in 2006 were favorably impacted by $0.7 million in adjustments to prior year reserve balances.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The values assigned to goodwill and intangibles, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by the Company.  In 2002, upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and periodically reviews goodwill for impairment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations. These allocations, including an assessment of estimated useful lives, have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies. Valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset, including historical cash flows.</P>
</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Asset Impairments</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred, based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. If the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.  Goodwill is reviewed periodically for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the Company, including the determination of an event indicating impairment; the future cash flows to be generated by the asset, including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action; the risk associated with those cash flows; and the Company's cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Research and Development ("R&amp;D"), Including In-Process R&amp;D ("IPR&amp;D")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to completed acquisitions, acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility, signified by FDA or comparable regulatory body approval, are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits.   Estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&amp;D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Inventories</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventories determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval. The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employee Benefit Plans</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirement, post-employment and health care benefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates, and health care cost and trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates, changes in historical experience, and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. Gains and losses arising from changes in assumptions are amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries. In determining pension costs for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, the Company used a discount rate of 5.75% i
n 2006, 6.00% in 2005 and 6.25% in 2004; an assumed return on plan assets of 8.00% in both 2006 and 2005 and 8.75% in 2004. The Company used an assumed rate of compensation increases of 4.5% for both 2006 and 2005 and 4.25% in 2004.  The changes in these plan assumptions did not have a significant impact on net earnings for the years involved.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">   The Company has two primary defined pension plans, one in the U.S. and one in Norway. Effective December 31, 2006, the Company froze these two pension plans; replacing both with enhanced defined contribution plans. In connection with the freezing of these plans, the Company recorded a net pre-tax curtailment and settlement gain, net of special termination benefits, of $7.5 million in 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Litigation and Contingencies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and also to certain other contingencies (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 15 to the Financial Statements).  The Company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred. Additionally, the Company assesses, in consultation with its counsel, the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis.  Reserves are recorded when the Company, in consultation with counsel, determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset.  In the event the Company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is recorded.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  At December 31, 2004, the Company had recorded significant U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which it had provided a full valuation allowance given that it was not considered to be "more likely than not" that these deferred tax assets would be realized. At December 31, 2005, the Company made the decision to reverse the remaining valuation allowance because it believed that it was "more likely than not" that these assets would be realized.  The Company's cash flow generated throughout 2005, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Generics Business, enabled the Company to pay off all of its domestic debt by January 23, 2006 which in turn, eliminated related interest expense, thereby increasing future profitability.  In addition, it is expected that the co
ntinuing domestic business segments, which have been profitable, will continue to be profitable.   </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $42.9 million compared to $247.3 million provided from operations in 2005. During 2006, the Company paid cash taxes of $64.4 million, including approximately $30 million in connection with the Company's Generics business, and additional cash payments of approximately $25 million related to the settlement of accrued expenses associated with the Generics Business disposition. Cash provided by operating activities in 2005 includes the cash flows of the divested Generics Business.  </P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash provided by investing activities for 2006 included the proceeds from the sale of ParMed of $40.1 million and, in 2005, the net proceeds from the sale of the Generics Business of $804.4 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $36.2 million in 2006, $38.9 million in 2005 and $49.3 million in 2004. Cash from investing activities includes cash flows of discontinued operations.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Working capital, including cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2006, was $198.0 million compared to working capital of $371.8 million at December 31, 2005.  Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.  Working capital at December 31, 2005 included the benefit of the cash proceeds from the sale of the Generics Business which was partially offset by the anticipated payment of all outstanding debt, which was classified as current liabilities at December 31, 2005. The decline in working capital from December 31, 2005 to 2006 is principally attributable to the fourth quarter 2006 Class B share repurchase for $307.4 million including related fees.  Trade working capital (accounts receivable and inventories, less accounts payable and accrued expenses) was higher at December 31, 2006 than 2005 because of increased receivables and inventory related to business growth and the settlement of December 31, 2005 tax and other liabilities related to the sale of the G

Additionally, the Company has a number of conditional supply agreements which obligate the Company to purchase products or services from vendors based on Company forecasts which are updated on a regular basis and at prices subject to negotiation and change.

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  The Company's risk management practice includes the selective use, on a limited basis, of forward foreign currency exchange contracts.  Such instruments are used for purposes other than trading.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in U.S. Dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies.  The Company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations.  The Company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency.  Such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>At December 31, 2006, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in Euros, Danish Krones, Hungarian Forints and U.S. Dollars with a notional amount of $74.9 million.  The fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material.  All contracts expire in the first quarter of 2007.  The cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non-functional currency transactions.  The change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than $10 million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable.  Such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Vice President Finance and Interim Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  The disclosure controls and procedures involve participation by various individuals in the Company having access to material information relating to the operations of the Company.  It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.  In addition, the design of any control s

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's CEO and CFO completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Rule 13a-15 as of December 31, 2006.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, utilizing the criteria described in  "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").  The objective of this assessment was to determine whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.  Based on that assessment the Company believes that, at December 31, 2006, its internal control over financial reporting was effective.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which follows.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;In its prior year assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, management identified one internal control deficiency that it concluded was a material weakness.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  In its assessment of the effectiveness internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, the Company determined that there were deficiencies in its internal controls over the financial reporting for income taxes and that these deficiencies constituted a material weakness, as described below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The sale of the Company's Generics Business in the fourth quarter of 2005 required the Company to affect numerous transactions related to the disposition and to recast its financial statements to separately present results from continuing and discontinued operations.  This included disaggregating income tax accounts between continuing and discontinued operations, accounting for taxes associated with the sale transaction and the repatriation of earnings, and evaluating and adjusting valuation allowances that had been provided in prior years for certain US deferred tax assets.  The fourth quarter 2005 accounting for income taxes required significant reliance upon external tax professionals and senior financial internal review and oversight, due to the complexities of the issues involved.  The integration and oversight of the work of these service providers reduced the timeliness and accuracy of recording the final tax provisions and related entries in the year-end closing process and th
e preparation of tax footnote disclosures.  The Company concluded that this reliance principally on outside providers and internal detective controls reduced the effectiveness of the internal controls over tax accounting processes.  Accordingly, the Company concluded that a material weakness existed at December 31, 2005 in that it did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting for income taxes, based on the criteria in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the COSO.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, management implemented enhanced control procedures related to the accounting for income taxes.  These included:  (i) the development and communication of enhanced policies and procedures for the accounting for income taxes, including expanded documentation requirements to support financial statement assertions, (ii) retaining a public accounting firm and other external tax professional services to assist the Company in its quarterly review, analysis and documentation of both its US and international income tax accounts, and (iii) expanding internal financial management review and oversight of income tax accounts and the work of outside tax service providers.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     While management believes the enhanced control procedures implemented in 2005 served to strengthen its internal control over the accounting for income taxes, these enhanced procedures did not contemplate a transaction of the magnitude and complexity of the December 19, 2005 sale of the Generics Business.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the December 19, 2005 sale of the Generics Business has simplified the Company, the tax accounting complexities and workload created by the fourth quarter 2005 transactions described above have been significantly reduced.  In addition, during 2006, the Company expanded its internal tax staff by recruiting three additional tax professionals; two of whom are responsible for the tax accounting and compliance function.  The Company believes that the addition of these tax professionals to its internal staff, combined with enhanced tax policies and procedures, and expanded financial management review and oversight, has served to remediate the material weakness at December 31, 2006 related to the financial reporting for income taxes.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">    Other than as described above, there have not been any other changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</P>

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is 
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</P>

Through its ownership of the Class B common stock, ALI had voting power that provided it with effective control of the Company.  On December 28, 2006, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from Industrier.  Including related fees, the cost of the repurchasing the B shares was $307,397.  Following the Class B share repurchase, control of the Company rests in the holders of the Class A shares acting by the majority applicable under Delaware law and Company's charter documents.

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and other matters</P>
</U><P><BR>
Basis of Presentation:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations have been presented for all periods to classify as Discontinued Operations, the Company's world-wide human Generics pharmaceutical business (the "Generics Business", which was sold on December 19, 2005), and ParMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("ParMed", which the Company sold on March 31, 2006).  See Note 3.  Consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No 95, "Statement of Cash Flows", the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have not been reclassified for activities of the discontinued operations.  </P>

<P>Principles of consolidation:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and international subsidiaries.  The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.</P>
<P><BR>
Use of estimates:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Cash equivalents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable.  The allowance is based on historical write-off experience, current economic conditions and a review of individual accounts.  Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility.  A specific reserve for individual accounts is recorded when the Company becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position.  If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables are further adjusted.  Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.  There is no off-balance-she
et credit exposure related to the Company's customers.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Inventories:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable is written down to its net realizable value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval.  The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained or the cost of the inventory will not be recoverable based on other factors.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Property, plant and equipment:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.  When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss included in net income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciable assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. A loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the assets. Fair value is determined based upon a market quote, if available, or is based on valuation techniques.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest is capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of major construction and software development projects.  No interest was capitalized in 2006 because the Company was in a debt free position.  In 2005 and 2004; $610, and $405 of interest costs were capitalized, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives which are generally as follows:</P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>Goodwill and Intangible Assets:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company follows SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" for all goodwill and intangibles acquired in business combinations. Under SFAS No. 142, all goodwill and certain intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized; but, are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite useful lives, such as patents and trademarks, are amortized over their useful lives, generally 5-20 years, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  See Note 9 for additional detail relating to the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Foreign currency translation and transactions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations are translated using average rates in effect during the year.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in income.  Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment representing the tax effects associated with long-term intercompany advances to foreign subsidiaries is zero, because in 2006 there was no such long-term intercompany debt.  The foreign currency translation adjustment for 2005 and 2004 was $275 and $(76), respectively, representing the tax effects associated with long-term intercompany advances to foreign subsidiaries and other liabilities.  </P>
<P><BR>
Derivative Instruments:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company uses derivative instruments on a limited basis, principally to manage its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company carries its derivative instruments at their fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts in current period earnings.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company selectively enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell certain cash flows in non-functional currencies and hedge certain firm commitments due in foreign currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts, other than hedges of firm commitments, are accounted for as foreign currency transactions and gains or losses are included in income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <BR>
Revenue Recognition:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  The Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment. Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stock-based Compensation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, "Share-Based Payments," effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation in net earnings. Stock-based compensation consists primarily of incentive stock options and restricted stock. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock at the dates of grant. Generally, stock options granted to employees fully vest four years from the grant date and have a term of 10&nbsp;years. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock options under the intrinsic value method described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations. The Company, applying the intrinsic value method, did not record stock-based compensation cost in net income because the exercise price of its stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, will be recognized in net earnings in the periods after the date of adoption. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options 
for the year ended December 31, 2006 in the amount of $2,383. The Company also recorded tax related benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006 in the amount of $834.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 123R requires the Company to present pro forma information for periods prior to adoption, as if it had accounted for all stock-based compensation under the fair value method of that Statement. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to its stock-based compensation for the periods indicated: </P>

Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization begins as portions of the projects are completed, ready for their intended purpose and placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the projects which are estimated to be five to seven years, depending on when placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized software costs related to the Company's Enterprise Resource Planning System, net of amortization, through December 31, 2006 and 2005 amounted to approximately $7,404 and $9,105, respectively, and are included in other assets.  All significant software modules were completed and ready for their intended purpose during 2003. </P>

&nbsp;  In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty&nbsp;in Income Taxes", an interpretation of SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".   FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before it is recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. For the Company, FIN 48 will be adopted as of January 1, 2007, as required. The Company is currently studying the impact of this interpretation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" which requires employers to recognize on their balance sheet, as of December 31, 2006, the funded status of their pension and postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2006, the U.S. pension plans were unfunded by $4,728 of which approximately $4,615 was included in noncurrent liabilities, $150 in accrued benefit cost and $37 in prepaid benefit cost. The domestic Postretirement Benefits plan was unfunded by $6,965 of which approximately $6,651 was included in noncurrent liabilities and $314 in current liabilities.  In addtion $3,940 was recognized in Stockholders Equity's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, ($2,561 net of tax), representing actuarial losses and unamortized prior service credits. The international defined benefit pension plans were unfunded by $6,398 which was included in noncurrent liabilities.    </P>

The purchase price was $4,331, approximately $900 of which is payable over three years, beginning on December 31, 2004. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed debt of approximately $6,677. The investment was previously recorded in accordance with the equity method, with the original 50% interest included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of the date of purchase, the Company consolidated the results of Wynco in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and included all related assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Wynco's first quarter 2004 revenues and operating losses were $19,169 and ($111), respectively.  The Company considered this an immaterial acquisition. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 30, 2004, the Company sold its 100% interest in this distribution company for $17,000. In connection with the sale, the Company recognized a charge within other income (expense) of $1,090 related to an intangible asset previously held. Excluding this charge, the Company has recognized a loss on the sale of $433.  As part of the transaction, the Company entered into an Agency and Distribution Agreement and Logistics Services Agreement with the buyer.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, stock options to purchase 641, 1,355 and 1,860 shares, respectively, were not included in the diluted EPS calculation because the option price was greater than the average market price of the Class A common shares.  Stock options had an anti-dilutive effect in 2004 and therefore stock options to purchase approximately 1,597 shares were not included in the diluted EPS calculation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The numerator for the calculation of basic EPS is Net income (loss) for all periods.  The numerator for the calculation of diluted EPS is Net income (loss) plus an add back for interest expense and debt cost amortization, net of income tax effects, related to the convertible notes when applicable.  The effects of the 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 (the "05 Notes") were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2005 or 2004 because the result was anti-dilutive. On April 1, 2005, the Company repaid the 05 Notes ($9,752 as of March 31, 2005).  In addition, the effects of the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "06 Notes") were not included in the calculation of the diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 because the result was anti-dilutive.  On January 23, 2006, the Company paid off the balance due on the 06 Notes.    </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     As required, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company performed the required annual test for impairment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     There was no Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006.  At December 31, 2005, the Company had $220,000 of 8.625% Senior Notes, due 2011 (the "Senior Notes"), $160,948 of 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes, due 2006 (yield 6.875%) and $25 of other international debt outstanding; of which $380,956 was classified as current because the Company had given the Trustees of both the Senior Notes and the 06 Notes notice that it would redeem such notes in January 2006 in accordance with the terms of the respective note indentures. On January 23, 2006, the Company paid off the balance due on both notes, including principal and accrued interest of $386,251 and call premium in the amount of $18,894.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 26, 2005, the Company entered into a five-year, Senior Secured Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A. consisting of a $175,000 asset-based, revolving loan facility and a $35,000 term loan. The Company used $119,122 of this facility to repay and retire the 2001 U.S. Bank Credit Facility in October 2005.  The Senior Secured Credit facility was subsequently paid down in full in December 2005 with the proceeds from the sale of the Generics business. The asset-based, revolving loan availability was reduced to $75,000 and the term loan was cancelled. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Secured Credit Facility, which was amended and restated on March 10, 2006 to reflect the sale of the Generics Business, is secured by the accounts receivable, inventory and certain fixed assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The amount that is available to the Company to be borrowed is determined monthly based upon the calculation of a Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under this Facility.  The interest rate that the Company would pay on outstanding amounts is based upon a spread over LIBOR or Base Rate. The spread ranges between 1.25% to 2.00% over LIBOR and 0% to 0.50% over the Base Rate. The determination of the spread is based upon the amount of availability under the facility with a lower spread payable based upon greater availability. As long as the Company does not have average availability less than $15,000 over a consecutive 10 day period, there are no financial covenants. In the event that
 the Company were to breach the availability threshold, the Company would be subject to a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1:1.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  At December 31, 2004, the Company had recorded significant U.S. federal deferred tax assets for which it had provided a full valuation allowance given that it was not considered to be "more likely than not" that these deferred tax assets would be realized. At December 31, 2005, the Company made the decision to reverse the remaining valuation allowance because it now believes that it is "more likely than not" that these assets will be realized.  The Company's cash flow generated throughout 2005, including the net proceeds from the sale of the Generics Business, enabled the Company to pay off all of its domestic debt by January 23, 2006 which in turn, served to eliminate related interest expense, thereby increasing future profitability.  In additio
n, it is expected that the continuing domestic business segments, which have been profitable for the past three years, will continue to be profitable.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has state loss carryforwards in several states which are available to offset future taxable income.  The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset related to these loss carryforwards.  Based on analysis of current information, which indicates that it is not more likely than not that the state losses will be realized, a valuation allowance has been established of $21,835 for the tax benefits of these loss carryforwards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Gross deferred tax liabilities of $3,334 and $3,822 are included within accrued and deferred income taxes, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Non-current deferred income tax liabilities amount to $27,885 and $18,468 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Current deferred tax assets are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and, net of valuation allowances, amount to $18,925 and $32,031 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Other assets and deferred charges include deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, of $48,817 and $52,011 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law on October 22, 2004.  The Act provided for a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by allowing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. At December 31, 2004, the Company had not determined whether or to what extent it would repatriate any foreign earnings under the Act and therefore did not accrue any taxes in 2004.  In 2005, the Company repatriated foreign earnings under the Act. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes approximately $28,600 related to this repatriation. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains two qualified noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its U.S. (domestic) employees: the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan which was frozen effective December 31, 2006 and the previously frozen Faulding Inc. Pension Plan.  The benefits payable from these plans are based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five years compensation during the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Ideally, the Plan assets will approximate the accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO"). The plan assets are held by two custodians and managed by two investment managers. Plan assets are invested in equities, government securities and bonds. In addition, the Company has unfunded supplemental executive pension plans providing additional benefits to certain employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an unfunded postretirement medical and nominal life insurance plan ("postretirement benefits") covering certain domestic employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993. The plan has not been extended to any additional employees. Retired eligible employees are required to make premium contributions for coverage as if they were active employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     The discount rate used in determining the 2006, 2005, and 2004 post retirement expense was 6.00%, 5.75% and 6.00%, respectively. The health care cost trend rate used to determine December 31, 2006 obligation was 8.0% for 2007, declining 0.5% per year until reaching 5.0% for 2013, and remaining level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the reported amounts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.<B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><U>Transactions with A.L. Industrier ASA </P>

</U><P>On December 28, 2006, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from A.L. Industrier thereby making them no longer a related party as defined under the regulations. </P>

<P>In 2003,  the Company had an administrative service agreement whereby the Company provided management services to Industrier. The agreement provided for payment equal to the direct and indirect cost of providing the services subject to a minimum amount. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company and Industrier entered into a new administrative service agreement whereby the Company provided management services and rented space to Industrier. The agreement provided for payment of a fixed yearly fee of approximately $146. Effective January 1, 2005, the Company and Industrier entered into a new administrative service agreement whereby the Company provided limited administrative services to Industrier.  The new agreement replaced and reduced amounts due under the previous agreement.  The 2005 agreement provided for payment of a fixed yearly fee of approximately $60.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the 1994 agreement to purchase Alpharma Oslo, Industrier retained the ownership of the Sk&oslash;yen manufacturing facility and administrative offices (not including leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment) and leases it to the Company. The Company is required to pay all expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the facility in addition to nominal rent. The lease has an initial 20-year term and is renewable at the then fair rental value at the option of the Company for four consecutive five year terms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company signed a net lease agreement with Industrier that provides for the leasing of a parking lot at the </FONT>Sk&oslash;yen<FONT SIZE=3> Facility through an initial term of October 2014 with the possibility of four consecutive five-year renewal terms. The annual rental is 2.4 million Norwegian Kroner (approximately $355 at 2006 average exchange rates).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;   As required, the above related party transactions were approved by the Company's Audit and Corporate Governance Committee.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, of a nature considered normal to its business.  It is the Company's policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of the Company, although the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with the following legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SEC Investigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements. The SEC has engaged in deposition and document discovery.  </P>

<B><P>Chicken Litter Litigation</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is one of multiple defendants that have been named in several lawsuits which allege that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce manure that contains an arsenical compound which, when used as agricultural fertilizer by chicken farmers, degrades into inorganic arsenic and causes a variety of diseases in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields).  The Company has provided notice to its insurance carriers and its primary insurance carriers have responded by accepting their obligations to defend or pay the Company's defense costs, subject to reservation of rights to later reject coverage for these lawsuits.  In addition, one of the Company's carriers has filed a Declaratory Judgment action in state court in which it has sought a ruling concerning the allocation of its coverage obligations to the Company among the Company's several insurance carriers and, to the extent the Company does not have full insurance c
overage, to the Company.  In addition, this Declaratory Judgment action requests that the Court rule that certain of the carrier's policies provide no coverage because certain policy exclusions allegedly operate to limit its coverage obligations under said policies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the approximately 175 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are asking for punitive damages and requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue.   In September 2006, in the first trial, which was brought by two plaintiffs, the Circuit Court of Washington County, Arkansas, Second Division, entered a jury verdict in favor of the Company.  The plaintiffs are appealing the verdict.  The court has ruled that future trials are on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. While the Company can give no assurance of the outcome of these matters, it believes that it will be able to continue to present credible scientific evidence that its product is not the cause of any injuries the plaintiffs may have suffered.  There is also the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in these lawsuits, as well as additional lawsuits in other jurisdictions where the product has b
een sold.  Worldwide sales of this product were approximately $23,300 in 2004, $23,100 in 2005 and $22,200 in 2006.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brazilian Tax Claims</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the subject of tax claims by the Brazilian authorities relating to sales and import taxes which aggregate approximately $10,000.  The claims relate to the operations of the Company's AH business in Brazil since 1999. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its position against these claims.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Environmental Regulations</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  <FONT SIZE=3>During 2005, the environmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Copenhagen and Oslo API manufacturing facilities gave the Company notice of revised waste discharge levels. The Company believes it has taken the actions necessary to comply with the requirements, including certain plant alterations and modifications at a cost not material to the Company.  The environmental authorities have not yet confirmed whether the Company's actions are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, in 2006 a criminal fine was levied against the Company's Oslo API facility based on allegations that certain of the discharge activities at the facility were in breach of applicable regulations.  The Company is in discussions with the local authorities regarding this fine. The failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations could result in further criminal or civil actions affecting production at these facilities which could be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Other Commercial Disputes</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any further responsibility for substantially all of the material contingent liabilities related to the Generics Business have has been transferred to Actavis or entities owned by Actavis, subject to certain representations or warranties made by the Company to Actavis as a part of the transaction to the extent such representations and warranties were incorrect.  The Company has retained certain specified liabilities which it believes are not material to the Company and, it is possible that the Company may be held responsible for certain liabilities of the Generics Business transferred to Actavis in the event Actavis fails or is unable to satisfy such liabilities.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business.

On December 28, 2006, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from Industrier.  Including related fees, the cost of the repurchase was approximately $307,397.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Prior to May 19, 2003, the Company granted options to key employees to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock under the 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan"). The maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Plan was 8,000,000. In addition, the Company had a Non-Employee Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan") which provided for the issue of up to 350,000 shares of Class A Common stock. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan could not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Options granted expired from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options were exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. The Plan permitted a cash appreciation right to be granted to certain employees. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 19, 2003, the Company's stockholders approved the Alpharma Inc. 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Incentive Compensation Plan").  The Incentive Compensation Plan permits stock option grants, stock appreciation rights grants ("SARs"), annual incentive awards, stock grants, restricted stock grants, restricted stock unit grants, performance stock grants, performance units grants, and cash awards.  Upon adoption of the Incentive Compensation Plan, no additional options were granted under the previously existing plans and all shares reserved under these existing plans were returned to the Company's supply of authorized but unissued shares, not reserved for any purpose, although outstanding options granted pursuant to the previously existing plans will remain outstanding.  Upon adoption, the maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Incentive Compensation Plan was 4,750,000 and the number of shares that were permitted to be issued for Awards other th
an stock options or SARS (both with a grant price equal to at least fair market value at date of grant), were not to exceed a total of 2,000,000 shares.  Options granted expire from three to ten years after the grant date.  Generally, options are exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant.  If an option holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which are not vested at the date of termination are forfeited.  As of December 31, 2006, there were 2,839,253 shares available for future grant under all plans.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of forfeitures, amounted to $4,576.  The total of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock is $5,635.  The weighted average remaining requisite service period of the non-vested stock options was approximately 27&nbsp;months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for restricted stock is recorded based on the market value of the stock on the grant date.  Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company capitalized the full amount of the restricted stock as unearned compensation, with an offset to additional paid-in capital. Effective January 1, 2006, in accordance with SFAS 123R, the Company reversed the unamortized balance of $5,395 against additional paid-in capital.  The fair value of restricted stock is amortized to expense over the requisite service period. Amortization expense related to restricted stock amounted to $2,461, $4,320 and $3,067 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan provided for the issuance of performance units that were valued based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return as compared to a market index of peer companies and the satisfaction of a free cash flow threshold. Each performance unit had a potential value between zero and $200. In conjunction with the sale of the Generics Business, which made the peer group comparison no longer relevant, the Company terminated the performance unit plan effective December 18, 2005.  The Company fixed the final payout for each outstanding performance unit at $100 per unit.   At December 31, 2006, the total value of performance units outstanding was $5,946.  This amount, net of forfeitures, will be paid out at the end of the plan's original three year vesting periods: December 31, 2006 and 2007.  The amount vested as of December 31, 2006, $3,278, was paid in the first quarter of 2007; the amount scheduled to vest as of Decemb
er 31, 2007, $2,668, will be paid in the first quarter of 2008.  This cost is being amortized to expense over the remaining service period.  The Company recognized expense related to performance units for its continuing operations for years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 in the amount of $4,501 and $163, respectively.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan by which eligible employees of the Company may authorize payroll deductions up to 4% of their regular base salary to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at fair market value. The Company matches these contributions with an additional contribution equal to 50% of the employee's contribution. Shares are issued on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Company's contributions to the plan were approximately $700, $1,400, $1,500 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are included within operating income.</P>

21.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Information Concerning Business Segments and Geographic Operations</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of each segment are evaluated based on earnings before interest and taxes (operating income).  Unallocated includes corporate expenses for administration, finance, legal, and certain unallocated expenses primarily related to the implementation of a company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning System, and the amortization of restricted stock and stock options; and, in 2006 and 2005, certain other expenses related to management retention and transition. Eliminations include inter-segment sales. Geographic revenues represent sales to third parties by country in which the selling legal entity is domiciled. Operating assets directly attributable to business segments are included in identifiable assets (i.e. sum of accounts receivable, inventories, net property, plant and equipment and net intangible assets). Operating assets for Pharmaceuticals do not include manufacturing property, plant and equipment. Cash, prepaid expenses, and other corporate and non-allocated assets are in
cluded in unallocated. Discontinued operations include the Generics Business and the ParMed Business.  For geographic reporting, long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and net intangibles.  Segment data includes immaterial inter-segment revenues. AH revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 include one product that individually accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues; Chlortetracyline ($115,500).  Pharmaceuticals revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 are entirely comprised of KADIAN sales, and account for more than 10% of consolidated revenues. One Pharmaceuticals' wholesale customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.</P>

The date, time and place of the annual meeting shall be determined by or under authority of the Board of Directors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 2.2.&#9;<U>Special Meetings</U>.  A special meeting of stockholders for any purpose may be called by the President of the Corporation, and shall be called by the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders entitled to cast at least one-tenth of the votes which all stockholders are entitled to cast at the particular meeting.  Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed special meeting.  The time and place of each special meeting of stockholders shall be determined by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, provided that if no such determination shall be made prior to the mailing of the notice for such meeting, the time and place for such meeting shall be determined by the President.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 2.3.&#9;<U>Notice</U>.

All such notices shall be given by mail or by other means reasonably selected by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary.  Notices which shall be mailed shall be deemed to be "given" when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage prepaid, and any notice transmitted other than by mail shall be deemed to have been "given" when delivered either to the stockholder or to any person reasonably requested to cause such notice to be transmitted to such stockholder.</P>

Except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, a quorum shall be deemed to be present at any meeting of stockholders for purposes of any given matter to be voted upon at such meeting if such meeting shall be attended by persons entitled (either personally or by proxy) to vote stock representing &#9;one-third (1/3) of the potential voting power with respect to such matter (as defined in Section 2.9(c) of these bylaws).  If a quorum shall not be present for purposes of any given matter to be voted upon at any meeting, the holders of the relevant stock (as defined in Section 2.9(d) of these bylaws) may, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power represented by such relevant stock, adjourn the meeting insofar as it relates to the given matter to another time and/or place.  Unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days or unless a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting, no notice of the adjou
rned meeting need be given to any stockholder provided that the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall have been announced at the meeting at which such adjournment shall have been taken.  At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting, provided that no business shall be transacted at such adjourned meeting on which any class of stock is entitled to be voted which class shall not have been permitted to participate in the vote to postpone the meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 2.6.&#9;<U>Vote Required</U>.  When a quorum is present at any meeting with respect to any given matter, a majority of the voting power represented by the relevant stock (as defined in Section 2.9(c) of these bylaws) shall be necessary and sufficient to approve such matter, except that: (i) if the given matter is one upon which by express provisions of an applicable statute or of the Certificate of Incorporation a different vote is required, such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question, and (ii) directors shall be elected by plurality vote.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>&#9;Section 2.7.&#9;<FONT FACE="CG Times"> </FONT><U>Proxies.</U>   At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote by proxy executed in writing or transmitted electronically or telephonically by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact.  Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation before commencement of the meeting or at such later time as shall be expressly permitted by the corporate officer presiding at such meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after three years from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 2.8.&#9;<U>Governing Rules</U>.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall preside at any meeting of any of the corporation's stockholders, provided that if the Chairman shall be unable or unwilling to so preside, then a person designated by the Board of Directors shall preside.  The person presiding at any meeting of any of the corporation's stockholders shall have the power to make rules and decisions (i) as to whether and to what extent proxies presented at the meeting shall be recognized as valid, (ii) as to the procedure for taking and counting votes at such meeting, (iii) as to procedures for the conduct of such meeting, and (iv) to resolve any questions which may be raised at such meeting.  The person presiding at any meeting of any of the corporation's stockholders shall have the right to delegate any of the powers contemplated by this Section 2.8 to such other person or persons as the person presiding deems desirable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 2.9.&#9;<U>Certain Definitions</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Entitled to be Voted</U>.  A share in any given class of the corporation's capital stock shall be deemed to be "entitled to be voted" with respect to any given matter at any meeting of the corporation's stockholders if (i) it shall be outstanding at the record date for such meeting and (ii) stock in such class shall have the right to be voted with respect to the given matter at such meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Voting Power</U>.  The "voting power" of any share of stock issued by the corporation with respect to any given matter to be voted upon at any meeting of the corporation's stockholders shall be equal to the size of the vote which such share would entitle its owner of record at the regular date for such meeting to cast at such meeting with respect to a given matter if such record owner were present at such meeting.  For example, with respect to any matter on which the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to vote together and neither the Class A Common Stock nor the Class B Common Stock is entitled to vote as a separate class, the "voting power" of a share of Class A Common Stock shall be one vote and the "voting power" of a share of Class B Common Stock shall be four votes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Potential Voting Power</U>.  The "potential voting power" with respect to any given matter to be voted upon at any meeting of any of the corporation's stockholders shall be equal to the aggregate voting power of all shares of stock entitled to be voted with respect to such matter at such meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(d)&#9;<U>Relevant Stock</U>.  Stock issued by the corporation shall be deemed to be "relevant stock" with respect to any given matter to be voted upon at any meeting of any of the corporation's stockholders if both (i) such stock is entitled to be voted with respect to the given matter and (ii) one or more of the persons attending the meeting in person or by proxy has a right to vote such stock by reason of being the record holder of such stock at the record date established for such meeting or by reason of holding voting rights assigned by the record holder entitled to vote such stock.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE THREE</U><BR>
<BR>
<U>Directors</U><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>General Powers</U>.  The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors.  The term "Board" whenever it is used in these bylaws means the corporation's Board of Directors.  In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon it by these bylaws, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Number of Directorship Positions</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Number of Directors</U>.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 3.2, the corporation's Board of Directors shall have the power (subject to any limitations prescribed by the Certificate of Incorporation) by a resolution adopted by not less than a majority of all directors serving on the Board at the time of such adoption to set at any time the number of total directorship positions on the Board.  Upon the adoption of any resolution in the manner provided in the preceding sentence, the total number of directorship positions on the corporation's Board of Directors shall be equal to the number specified in such resolution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Board's Power to Alter The Number of Directors</U>.  The corporation's Board of Directors shall have the power (subject to any limitations prescribed by the Certificate of Incorporation) by a resolution adopted by not less than a majority of all directors serving on the Board at the time of such adoption to alter from time to time the number of total directorship positions on the Board.  Upon the adoption of any resolution in the manner provided in the preceding sentence, the total number of directorship positions on the corporation's Board of Directors shall be equal to the number specified in such resolution.  If the Board shall determine to reduce the number of directorship positions, then the term of each incumbent member shall end upon the election of directors at the next annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation and the persons elected to fill such reduced number of directorship positions shall be deemed to be the successors to all persons who shall have pr
eviously held such directorship positions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 3.3.&#9;<U>Regular Meetings</U>.  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 3.4.&#9;<U>Special Meetings</U>.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the President or any three directors.  The person or persons who call(s) an special meeting of the Board of Directors may fix the time and place at which the meeting shall be held.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 3.5.&#9;<U>Notice</U>.  Notice of any special meeting shall be given at least twenty-four hours prior thereto if notice is given directly to the director by telephone or in person or at least two days prior thereto if notice is given by telegram, telex or by any other method reasonably calculated to cause the notice to be delivered within twenty-four hours after its transmission or at least five days prior thereto if transmitted by mail.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be "given" when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the director at either his business address or such other address as the officer sending such notice shall reasonably believe appropriate, with postage thereon prepaid.  If notice be given by telegram, telex, or other method reasonably calculated to reach the director within twenty-four hours after its transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be "given" when the notice so addressed either is delivered to an independent company wit
h instructions for prompt transmission or is transmitted.  Any director may waive notice of any meeting by signing a written waiver of notice either before or after the meeting.  The attendance of a director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;Section 3.6.&#9;<U>Quorum</U>.  Except as otherwise provided in the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, directors holding a majority of the positions on the Board of Directors established pursuant to Section 3.2 of these bylaws shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors; provided that if less than a majority of such number of directors are present at any meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum is obtained.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

Subject to Agent's and Lenders' receipt of a duly executed counterpart of this letter agreement from

If the Compensation Committee determines that the Company Target AOP Execution was exceeded it may, in its full discretion, establish the Actual Bonus Pool for Company Executives at an amount not to exceed 200% of the relevant Target Bonus Pool.   If the Compensation Committee determines that the Company Target AOP Execution was not achieved, it may, at its full discretion, provide for an Actual Bonus Pool for Company Executives in an amount below the relevant Target Bonus Pool; provided that there shall be no Actual Bonus Pool if the Threshold AOP Execution is not achieved.</LI>
<U>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><LI>   If the Compensation Committee determines that the SBU Target AOP Execution was achieved (with each SBU being treated individually) the Actual Bonus Pool for said SBU shall be equal to the relevant Target Bonus Pool.  If the Compensation Committee determines that the SBU Target AOP Execution was exceeded it may, in its full discretion, establish the Actual Bonus Pool for said SBU at an amount not to exceed 200% of the relevant Target Bonus Pool.   If the Compensation Committee determines that the SBU Target AOP Execution was not achieved, it may, in its full discretion, provide for an Actual Bonus Pool for the SBU in an amount below the relevant Target Bonus Pool; provided that there shall be no Actual Bonus Pool if the SBU Threshold AOP Execution is not achieved.  In addition, except under extraordinary circumstances, the Compensation Committee will not establish any SBU Actual Bonus Pools if the Company did not achieve Threshold AOP Execution.</LI>
<FONT SIZE=2><P> </P>
</FONT><LI>As soon as practicable after the end of each Incentive Year, the relevant SBU Presidents (or the CEO as to Company Executives and SBU Presidents) shall determine whether (or the extent to which) each Participant has met his or her Individual Goals.  Based upon this determination, and contingent upon the existence of an Actual Bonus Pool relevant to such Participant, a Participant may receive less (down to zero) or more than his or her Target Bonus but in no event more than the Maximum Bonus.</LI>

<LI>After the determinations required under Section 4 (d), the Actual Bonus Pool for each SBU and the Company Executives as a group shall then be available for payments to Eligible Employees employed within each of said entities.</LI>

<LI>In no event shall the aggregate Bonus Awards computed for payment pursuant to this Section 4 exceed the relevant Company or SBU Actual Bonus Pool computed separately for each of the SBU's and the Company Executives as a group.   In the event the computations required by this Section 4 would cause the requirements of the previous sentence to be violated, the amount of each relevant Participant's Bonus Award shall be reduced pro rata in an amount that will allow the aggregate of all Bonus Awards to comply with the provisions of the previous sentence.</LI>

<LI>The CEO may allocate any amounts remaining in any one of the Actual Bonus Pools, after the payment of all Bonus Awards due pursuant to the previous subsections of this Section 4, among one or more of the Participants in another SBU or to a Company Executive in such amounts and considering such factors as she believes appropriate; provided that no Participant shall receive more than his or her Maximum Bonus.   The CEO (with the concurrence of the Compensation Committee) may make Bonus Awards in the absence, or in excess, of a relevant Actual Bonus Pool to reward extraordinary work or effort on the part of a Participant; provided that no Participant shall receive more than his or her Maximum Bonus.</LI>

<LI>Any funds remaining in any of the Actual Bonus Pools after the payment of all Bonus Awards shall be considered general assets of the Company.</LI></OL>

<LI>All payments made under this Plan shall be subject to any required withholdings.</LI>

<LI>Bonus Awards shall be payable soley from the general assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.

ortion of the Incentive Year during which he or she was not an employee of the Company or an SBU.   If an employee transfers from one SBU to another (or between the Company and an SBU) during the Incentive Year his or her Bonus Award shall be prorated based upon the portion of the Incentive Year in each unit.

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") has established the Alpharma Inc. 2005 Supplemental Savings Plan (the "Plan") effective January 1, 2005.  The Plan is being amended and restated in its entirety effective January&nbsp;1, 2005.  The Plan is an unfunded arrangement established and maintained by the Company for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to January 1, 2006, Participants were permitted to defer a portion of their Compensation to the Plan after their pre-tax deferrals under the Alpharma Inc. Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan") reached the applicable dollar amount specified under Section 402(g) of the Code for that year. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No employee shall become a Participant in the Plan after December 31, 2005.  Participants are no longer permitted to elect to defer Compensation effective as of the first payroll period ending in 2006.  The cessation of deferrals under the Plan is not a material modification pursuant to Prop. Treas. Reg. Section&nbsp;1.409A-6(a)(4)(iii).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder and related guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").  </P>

Any designation shall be revocable at any time through a written instrument filed by the Participant with the Committee with or without the consent of the previous Beneficiary.  In the event that a Participant who designated his or her spouse as Beneficiary under the Plan subsequently becomes divorced or legally separated, then such prior Beneficiary designation shall automatically be deemed revoked as it relates to the spouse (or former spouse), unless it is subsequently ratified in writing by the Participant.</P>

If no parent is living and the Committee decides not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, then payment shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor is duly appointed and currently acting within 60 days after the date the amount becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the estate of the minor.  Payment by the Company pursuant to any unrevoked Beneficiar

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Initial Election Period</U>.  Each Eligible Employee may elect to defer Compensation by filing with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election that conforms to the requirements of this Section 3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that Committee may specify).  Such Compensation Deferral Election, however, can only relate to Compensation that has not yet been earned.  No later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that the Committee may specify), the Eligible Employee shall also file with the Committee a Payment Election with respect to such deferral of Compensation and related Company Matching Contributions, if any, on a form provided by the Committee.  In the event that an Eligible Employee does not file a Payment Election during the Initial Election Period, the Eligible Employee shall be deemed to have elected a lump sum with respect to such def
erral of Compensation and related Company Matching Contributions.  The deemed election of the lump sum will continue in effect for future Plan Years until the Eligible Employee makes a new Payment Election pursuant to subsection (d). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>General Rule</U>.  The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer is such Compensation to be earned after the time at which the Eligible Employee files with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a).  The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer shall be a percentage of Compensation, which shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Eligible Employee's Compensation, provided that the total amount deferred by a Participant shall be limited in any calendar year, if necessary, to satisfy social security taxes (including Medicare), income taxes and employee benefit plan withholding requirements, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Committee.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Duration of Compensation Deferral Election</U>.  An Eligible Employee's initial Compensation Deferral Election must be made prior to the Effective Date and is to be effective with respect to Compensation earned after such Compensation Deferral Election is processed.

In the absence of an affirmative election by the Participant to the contrary, a Compensation Deferral Election for one Plan Year will continue in effect for future Plan Years.  In the case of an employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Effective Date, such Eligible Employee shall have 30 days from the date he or she has become an Eligible Employee to make an Initial Elect

Such Compensation Deferral Election shall be for the remainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced.  All Compensation Deferral Elections made prior to December 31, 2005 shall be revoked with respect to compensation paid after the last payroll period in 2005.</P>

A Participant may change his or her Payment Election with respect to Compensation for any subsequent Plan Year by filing a new Payment Election not less than 14 days prior to the beginning of the next Plan Year, which Payment Election shall be effective on the first day of the next following Plan Year.  In the absence of an affirmative Payment Election by the Participant to the contrary, a Payment Election for one Plan Year will continue in effect for future Plan Years.  In the case of an employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Effective Date, such Eligi

Such Payment Election shall be for the remainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may modify his or her Payment Election for a prior Plan Year only in accordance with Section 6.1.  All Payment Elections made prior to December&nbsp;31, 2005 shall be revoked.</P>

An election to defer Compensation must be filed in a timely manner in accordance with Sections 3.1(c) and (d).</P>

The Plan is an unfunded arrangement maintained by the Company for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations thereunder and related guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").  </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>
<A NAME="_Toc467396948"><B>ARTICLE I<BR>
DEFINITIONS</A></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever the following words and phrases are used in this Plan, with the first letter capitalized, they shall have the meanings specified below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1&#9;"Account" shall mean the booking entry maintained by, or for, the Committee for each Participant, which Account is credited with amounts equal to the portion of Compensation that he or she elects to defer and earnings and losses thereon. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&#9;"Base Salary" shall mean a Participant's annual base compensation, excluding bonuses, commissions, incentive and all other remuneration for services rendered to the Company and prior to reduction for any salary deferrals, including but not limited to, deferrals under plans established pursuant to Section 125 of the Code or qualified pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3&#9;"Beneficiary" or "Beneficiaries" shall mean the person or persons, including a trustee, personal representative or other fiduciary, last designated in writing by a Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Committee to receive the benefits specified hereunder in the event of the Participant's death.  No beneficiary designation shall become effective until it is filed with the Committee.  Any designation shall be revocable at any time through a written instrument filed by the Participant with the Committee with or without the consent of the previous Beneficiary.  In the event that a Participant who designated his or her spouse as Beneficiary under the Plan subsequently becomes divorced or legally separated, then such prior Beneficiary designation shall automatically be deemed revoked as it relates to the spouse (or former spouse), unless it is subsequently ratified in writing by the Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is no such designation, or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, then the Participant's surviving spouse shall be the Beneficiary.  If there is no surviving spouse, the duly appointed and currently acting personal representative of the Participant's estate (which shall include either the Participant's probate estate or living trust) shall be the Beneficiary.  In any case where there is no such personal representative of the Participant's estate duly appointed and acting in that capacity within 90 days after the Participant's death (or such extended period as the Committee determines is reasonably necessary to allow such personal representative to be appointed, but not to exceed 180 days after the Participant's death), then Beneficiary shall mean the person or persons who can verify by affidavit or court order to the satisfaction of the Committee that they are legally entitled to receive the benefits specified hereunder.  In the event any amount is payable under the Plan
 to a minor, payment shall not be made to the minor, but instead be paid (a) to that person's living parent(s) to act as custodian, (b) if that person's parents are then divorced, and one parent is the sole custodial parent, to such custodial parent, to act as custodian, or (c) if no parent of that person is then living, to a custodian selected by the Committee to hold the funds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the jurisdiction in which the minor resides.  If no parent is living and the Committee decides not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, then payment shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor is duly appointed and currently acting within 60 days after the date the amount becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the estate of the minor.  Payment by the Company pursuant to any unrevoked Beneficiar
y designation, or to the Participant's estate if no such designation exists, shall be considered complete satisfaction of all benefits owed under the Plan.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.4&#9;"Board of Directors" or "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.5&#9;"Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.11&#9;"Eligible Employee" shall mean an employee of the Company who is designated by the Committee as eligible to participate in the Plan (and who continues to be so designated).  An Eligible Employee shall not include an employee who is not paid from a U.S. payroll. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.12&#9;"ERISA" shall mean the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.13&#9;"Fund" or "Funds" shall mean one or more of the investment funds selected by the Committee pursuant to Section 3.3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.14&#9;"Initial Election Period" shall mean the 30-day period prior to the Effective Date of the Plan, or the 30-day period following the time an employee shall be designated by the Committee as an Eligible Employee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15&#9;"Interest Rate" shall mean, for each Fund, an amount equal to the net gain or loss on the assets of such Fund during each month (or such other period as is established from time to time), as determined by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.16&#9;"Investment Fund Subaccount" or "Investment Fund Subaccounts" shall mean one or more subaccounts under a Participant's Account which corresponds to the Funds elected by the Participant pursuant to Section 3.3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.17&#9;"Participant" shall mean any Eligible Employee who becomes a Participant in this Plan in accordance with Article II.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.18&#9;"Payment Date" shall mean the date that a Participant's Account under the Plan is scheduled to be paid to the Participant.

In no event shall a Participant's Payment date be later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant has been separated from service with the Company for six months, or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date on which the Participant has been separated from service with the Company for six months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.19&#9;"Plan" shall mean this Alpharma Inc. 2007 Supplemental Savings Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.20&#9;"Plan Year" shall be the calendar year.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.21&#9;"Unforeseeable Emergency" shall mean a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or of his or her spouse or dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code), loss of a Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar or extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant.  The circumstances that would constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency will depend upon the facts of each case, and the Committee has the sole and exclusive ability to determine whether such an Unforeseeable Emergency exists, but, in any case, an Unforeseeable Emergency may not be made to the extent that such hardship is or may be relieved (a) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, or (b) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent that the liquidation of assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship. The amounts di
stributed with respect to an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&#9;<U>Eligibility</U>.  The Committee shall designate, as of the Effective Date and as of the beginning of each Plan Year, such employee of the Company, as it determined in its sole discretion, as an Eligible Employee.  The Committee may, from time to time, designate an employee as an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year.  </P>

Each Eligible Employee may elect to defer Compensation by filing with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election that conforms to the requirements of this Section 3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that the Committee may specify).   Such Compensation Deferral Election, however, can only relate to Compensation that has not yet been earned.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>General Rule</U>.  The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer is such Compensation to be earned after the time at which the Eligible Employee files with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a).  The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer shall be a percentage of Compensation, which shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the Eligible Employee's Compensation, provided that the total amount deferred by a Participant shall be limited in any calendar year, if necessary, in order to satisfy social security taxes (including Medicare), income taxes and employee benefit plan withholding requirements, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Committee.  A Participant may elect to defer different percentages of his or her Base Salary and STIP.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Duration of Compensation Deferral Election</U>.  An Eligible Employee's Compensation Deferral Election for a Plan Year is irrevocable for that Plan Year. A Participant may increase, decrease or terminate a Compensation Deferral Election with respect to Compensation for any subsequent Plan Year by filing a new Compensation Deferral Election not less than 16 days prior to the beginning of the next Plan Year, which election shall be effective on the first day of the next following Plan Year.  In the absence of an affirmative election by the Participant to the contrary, a Compensation Deferral Election for one Plan Year will continue in effect for future Plan Years.  In the case of an employee who is hired by the Company during the Plan Year and is an Eligible Employee, such Eligible Employee shall have 30 days from the date he or she becomes an Eligible Employee to make an Initial Election with respect to deferral of Compensation.  Such Compensation Deferral Election shall be for th
e remainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Elections other than Elections during the Initial Election Period</U>.  Subject to the limitations of Section 3.1(b) above, any Eligible Employee who has terminated a prior Compensation Deferral Election may elect to again defer Compensation, by filing a Compensation Deferral Election on forms provided by the Committee, not less than 16 days  prior to the beginning of the Plan Year to which such Compensation Deferral Election relates.  An election to defer Compensation must be filed in a timely manner in accordance with Section 3.1(c).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&#9;<U>Timing of Deferrals</U>.  Deferrals to the Plan made pursuant to a Participant's Compensation Deferral Election shall commence on the first day of the first payroll period in each Plan Year and shall continue until the last payroll period in the Plan Year.  In the case of a Participant who becomes a Participant during a Plan Year, deferrals to Plan pursuant to his or her Compensation Deferral Election shall commence on the first day of the first administratively practicable payroll period after the Participant submits his or her Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a) of the Plan.</P><DIR>

<BR>
<U>SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN</U><BR>
<BR>
<U>SECTION 1</U><BR>
<BR>
<U>Introduction</U><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>The Plan and Its Effective Date</U>. The A. L. Pharma Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan (the "Plan") is maintained by Alpharma Inc. (the "Company").  The Plan was originally established by A. L. Pharma Inc. effective as of July 1, 1994.  The Plan is being amended and restated in its entirety effective January 1, 2005.  With respect to benefits under the Plan that were not vested as of December 31, 2004, the Company intends that Section 409A of the Code, the regulations issued thereunder and any other applicable IRS guidance shall apply. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Purpose</U>. The Company maintains the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") which is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  While the Code places limitations on the maximum amount of an employee's compensation that may be taken into account for determining benefits payable under a qualified plan, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), permits the payment under an "unfunded plan" of the benefits which may not be paid under a qualified plan because of such limitation.  The purpose of this Plan is to provide a certain level of additional benefits which may not be provided under the pension plan because of the maximum compensation limitation of the Code.  Effective January 1, 2006, the Plan is frozen. </P>

<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 2</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Eligibility</U>.  Only those highly compensated or key management employees of the Company or its affiliates, who participate in the Pension Plan and who were employed on June 30, 1994, shall participate in the Plan (the "Participants"), subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan.  Highly compensated key management employees hired after June 30, 1994, shall be eligible to participate in the Plan at the discretion of the Committee. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Amount of Benefits</U>.  Subject to Section 2.3 below, with respect to a participant who becomes entitled to a pension benefit under the Pension Plan, and such benefit has been limited as a result of the maximum compensation limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (as such maximum compensation limitation is incorporated in the pension plan and as it may be changed from time to time), he or she shall be entitled to receive under this Plan the portion of the Participant's pension benefit under the pension plan which exceeds the benefit payable to the Participant under the Pension Plan after applying the legal maximum compensation limitation; provided, however, that the annual compensation earned by a Participant for this purpose shall not exceed $235,840.  Such estimated limitation shall be determined by the Committee (as defined in section 3.1).  A Participant's benefit under this Plan shall be referred to hereinafter as a Participant's "Supplement
al Pension Benefit."  With respect to determining a Participant's Supplemental Pension Benefit, service after December 31, 2005 and compensation paid after the last payroll period ending in 2005, shall not be taken into account.  A participant who becomes employed by an unrelated employer upon the sale of (i) all or substantially all the assets used by the Company in the employing trade or business, or (ii) the Company's interest in the employing subsidiary, shall be deemed to have separated from service on the date immediately preceding the date that such participant becomes an employee of the purchaser, unless the purchaser agrees in connection with the sale to be substituted for the Company as the sponsor of Plan.  Such participant shall be entitled to a distribution in accordance with the terms of Section 2.4. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Vesting</U>.  If a Participant resigns or is dismissed from the employ of the Company and all of its controlled group members prior to completing at least five years of employment service with the Company or any of its controlled group, the Participant shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participants (i) whose employment is transferred from the controlled group that includes the Company to the controlled group that includes Actavis Group hf. on or about December 16, 2005, or (ii) who are employees involuntarily terminated as a result of the sale of the Company's generics business, shall be entitled to a benefit under the Plan based on their service through their termination date, regardless of whether such Participants have completed at least five years of employment service. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment of Benefits</U>.  A Participant's supplemental pension benefit under this Plan shall be paid to the Participant in the form of monthly annuity installments over the life of the Participant or, if the Participant is married at the time of his or her retirement and has not elected another form of distribution, monthly annuity installments over the joint lives of the Participant and his or her spouse.  At the election of the Participant, in the alternative, benefits can be paid in the form of a period certain and life monthly annuity, a 50% or 100% joint and survivor monthly annuity, or a lump sum.  In the case of the death of the Participant prior to commencement of benefits hereunder, if the Participant is married at the time of his or her death, 50% of his or her Plan benefit shall be paid as a monthly annuity installment for the life of his or her spouse beginning as of the later of the Participant's death or the date the participant would have attain
ed age 55.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2006, upon a Participant's termination from employment, a Participant's Supplemental Pension Benefit under the Plan shall be paid to the Participant, or in the event of his or her death, the Participant's beneficiary, in a lump sum on or as soon as administratively practicable following the date that is six months after such Participant's termination from employment.  The lump sum payment shall be determined using the actuarial assumptions used to determine lump sum payments under the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan as of the date of distribution. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Funding</U>.  Benefits payable under this Plan to a Participant or his beneficiary shall be paid directly by the Company. The Company shall not be required to segregate on its books or otherwise any amount to be used for payment of supplemental pension benefits under this Plan.  This Plan shall constitute an unfunded arrangement and any amounts actually set aside by the Company shall remain as Company assets, subject to the general creditors of the Company.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 3</U><BR>
</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">General Provisions</U><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Committee</U>. This Plan shall be administered by the pension plan administrative committee (the "Committee"). The Committee shall have, to the extent appropriate, the same powers, rights, duties and obligations with respect to this Plan as it has with respect to the pension plan. Each determination provided for in this Plan shall be made by the Committee under such procedure as may from time to time be prescribed by the Committee and shall be made in the absolute discretion of the Committee. Any determination so made shall be conclusive on all parties.</P>

<P>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Beneficiary</U>. A participant's "beneficiary" under this Plan means (i) any person who becomes entitled to benefits under the pension plan because of the participant's death, or (ii) if the Participant has no designated beneficiary for purposes of the pension plan as set forth in (i) above, or if his or her beneficiary designated for purposes of the pension plan as set forth in (i) above dies before the date of the participant's death, any one or more of the participant's estate and his or her relatives by blood or marriage, in such proportions as the Committee determines.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment Rights</U>.  Establishment of the Plan shall not be construed to give any participant the right to be retained in the Company's service or to any benefits not specifically provided by the Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Withholding</U>. The Committee shall deduct from all payments under the Plan any taxes required to be withheld under the laws of the United States or any state, including but not limited to Federal and/or state income and employment taxes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Interests Not Transferable</U>. Except as to withholding of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state, the interests of the participants and their beneficiaries under the Plan are not subject to the claims of their creditors and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred, assigned, alienated or encumbered.  No participant shall have any right to any benefit payments hereunder prior to the Participant's termination of employment with the Company and all other companies which are part of the controlled group of companies which includes the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment with Respect to Incapacitated Participants or Beneficiaries</U>.  If any person entitled to benefits under the Plan is under a legal disability or in the Committee's opinion is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or her financial affairs, the Committee may direct the payment of such benefit to such person's legal representative or to a relative or friend of such person for such person's benefit, or the Committee may direct the application of such benefits for the benefit of such person in any manner which the Committee may select that is consistent with the Plan.  Any payments made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section shall be a full and complete discharge of any liability for such payments.  The Committee shall deduct from all payments any taxes required to be withheld under the laws of the United States or any state, including but not limited to Federal and/or state income and employment taxes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Limitation of Liability</U>. To the extent permitted by law, no person (including the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, the Committee, any present or former member of the Board, or the Committee, and any present or former officer of the Company) shall be personally liable for any act done or omitted to be done in good faith in the administration of the Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Controlling Law</U>.  To the extent not superseded by federal law, the laws of New Jersey shall be controlling in all matters relating to the Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Gender and Number</U>.  Where the context admits, words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Action by the Company</U>.  Any action required of or permitted by the Company under the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or any person or persons authorized by resolution of such Board.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Successor to the Company</U>.  The term "Company" as used in the Plan shall include any successor to the Company by reason of merger, consolidation, the purchase of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or otherwise.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Miscellaneous</U>. The Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives, successors and assigns, and all persons entitled to benefits hereunder.  Any notice given in connection with the Plan shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or by registered mail, return receipt requested.  Any notice given by registered mail shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of delivery indicated on the registered mail return receipt, if correctly addressed.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 4</P>
</U>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Amendment and Termination</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Company expects to continue the Plan, it must necessarily reserve and hereby does reserve the right to amend the Plan from time to time or to terminate the Plan at any time; provided that no amendment of the Plan nor the termination of the Plan may cause the reduction or cessation of any benefits that were accrued as of the date of such amendment or termination and otherwise would be payable under this Plan, but for such amendment or termination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the portion of the Participant's Supplemental Pension Benefit that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, the Company may terminate the Plan only to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder and other guidance issued by the IRS, including but not limited to the following:  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may terminate the Plan within twelve (12) months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Section 331 of the Code, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section&nbsp;503(b)(1)(A), provided that the amounts deferred under the Plan are included in the Participants' gross incomes in the latest of:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first calendar year in which payment is administratively practicable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may terminate the Plan within the thirty (30) days preceding or the twelve (12) months following a change in control event (as defined under Prop. Treas. Reg. Section&nbsp;1.409A-2(g)(4)(i)).  The Plan may be terminated provided that all similar arrangements sponsored by the Company are terminated, so that Participants in the Plan and all participants in similar arrangements receive their entire amounts within twelve (12) months of the date of Plan termination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may terminate the Plan provided that:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All similar arrangements are terminated;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No payments other than payments that would be payable under the terms of the Plan or similar arrangements, if the termination had not occurred, are made within twelve (12) months of termination;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All payments are made within twenty-four (24) months of termination; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company does not adopt any new similar arrangement at any time within five (5) years following termination.</P>

No member of the Committee shall be liable for anything done or omitted to be done by him or her or by any other member of the Committee in connection with the Plan, except for his or her own willful misconduct or as expressly provided by statute.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Director Option Shares</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The stock subject to the Director Options and other provisions of this Plan shall be shares of the Company's Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, with $.20 par value (hereinafter referred to as the "Class&nbsp;A Stock"). The aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock authorized to be issued upon exercise of Director Options and reserved for issuance under the Plan is 350,000. In the event that application of any provision of this Plan would result in the issuance of, or the right to purchase, any fractioned share of Class&nbsp;A Stock, the fraction shall be rounded to a full share.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Granting of Director Options</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Subject to the discretion and approval of the Board of Directors, each director shall receive an option to purchase up to 10,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock immediately following each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company at which such director is elected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. If a director is elected or appointed to the Board of Directors other than at the annual meeting of stockholders, such director shall receive as of the date of such election or appointment an option to purchase a number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock equal to (i)&nbsp;the amount of the then most recent grant multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining from the date of such election or appointment until the anniversary of the preceding annual meeting of the stockholders and the denominator of which is 365. The price at which shares may be purchased pursuant to any Director Option shall be the fair market value of the shares on th
e date that the Director Option is granted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Eligibility</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The individuals who will be eligible to receive Director Options will be each person elected or appointed as a director of the Company who is not also an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries at the time such person is so elected or appointed. A Director Option granted to a director under this Plan shall continue to be effective in accordance with its terms notwithstanding that prior to or subsequent to the grant of such option such director was or becomes an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Terms of Director Options; Vesting</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each Director Option shall have a term of ten years from the date of grant or such lesser term as is approved by the Board of Directors (the "Option Term"); provided that if a director ceases to be a director for any reason, all Director Options held by such Director shall terminate on the fifth anniversary, of the date on which such individual ceases to be a director, if such director has served for five years or more, or otherwise on the first anniversary of the date on which such individual ceases to serve as a Director (the "Early Termination Date"). Each Director Option which has become vested (as described below) may be exercised from time to time until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the end of the Option Term or (ii)&nbsp;the Early Termination Date, in part or in whole. The exercise price of each Director Option may be paid in cash or by delivery of shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock previously acquired by the optionee having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the Director Op
tion being exercised. Each Director Option shall vest in full on the date of the first annual meeting of stockholders following the date of grant of such option; provided that if a person ceases to be a director for reason of disability or death prior to such vesting date, a portion of any unvested Director Options held by such director shall vest as of the day preceding the date such person ceases to be a director for such reason, which portion shall be equal to (i)&nbsp;the number of unvested Director Options held by such director multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Director has held such unvested option and the denominator of which is&nbsp;365. If a Director is removed from the Board or resigns other than for reasons of disability or death, the unvested Director Options held by such director shall not vest following such removal or resignation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exercise of Director Options</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Director Options shall be exercised by the delivery of written notice to the Company (Attention: Treasurer) setting forth the number of shares with respect to which the Director Option is to be exercised and the address to which the certificates for such shares are to be mailed, together with (i)&nbsp;cash (including checks, bank drafts or postal or express money orders payable to the order of the Company) or (ii),&nbsp;shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock, previously acquired, having an aggregate value equal to the option price of such shares. As promptly as practicable after receipt of such written notification and payment, the Company shall deliver to the optionee certificates for the number of shares with respect to which such Director Option has been so exercised ("Option Shares"), issued in the optionee's name; provided, that such delivery shall be deemed effected for all purposes when such certificates shall have been deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the optionee, at th
e address specified pursuant to this paragraph. For all purposes, an optionee shall be deemed to have exercised a Director Option and to have purchased and become the holder of the Option Shares as of the date the Company receives written notification of exercise and payment as provided herein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transferability of Director Options</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Director Options shall not be transferable other than upon such terms and conditions and to such transferee as the Director Options Committee may approve (pursuant to provisions of an option agreement approved by the Director Options Committee, or upon request in individual cases).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Requirements Imposed by Law and Director Options Committee</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company shall not be required to sell or issue any shares under any Director Option if the issuance of such shares shall constitute a violation by the optionee or by the Company of any provisions of any law or regulation of any governmental authority. Any determination in this connection by the Director Options Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company shall not be required to issue any shares upon exercise of any option unless the Company has received the optionee's representation or other evidence satisfactory to it to the effect that the holder of such Director Option will not transfer such Option Shares in any manner which could constitute a violation of any securities or other law, or which would not be in compliance with such other conditions as the Director Options Committee may deem appropriate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Director Options Committee may impose such other limitations on the exercise of Director Options as it concludes are necessary to comply with applicable law and carry out the intent and purpose of the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>No Rights as Stockholder</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;No optionee shall have rights as a stockholder with respect to shares covered by a Director Option until the date of exercise of such Director Option; and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph&nbsp;12 hereof, no adjustment for dividends, or otherwise, shall be made if the record date therefore is prior to the date of exercise of such option.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>No Obligation to Retain Director</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The granting of any option shall not impose upon Company, its stockholders or the Board of Directors any obligation to elect, appoint or retain any person as a member of the Board of Directors; and the right to remove any director as provided by applicable law shall not be diminished or affected by reason of the fact that a Director Option has been granted to such Director.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Changes in the Company's Capital Structure</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The existence of outstanding Director Options shall not affect in any way the right of power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations, or other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds, debentures or preferred or prior preference stock senior to or otherwise affecting the Class&nbsp;A Stock or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If the Company shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of shares or other capital readjustment, or pay a dividend in shares of its Class&nbsp;A or Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, then (a)&nbsp;the number, type, and per share price of shares of stock subject to outstanding Director Options hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted in such a manner as to entitle each optionee to receive upon exercise of his Director Option, for the same aggregate consideration, the same total number and type of shares as he would have received as a result of the event requiring the adjustment had he exercised his Director Option in full immediately prior to such event; provided, however, that if any such adjustment would result in the right to purchase a fractional share, the number of shares subject to the Director Option will be decreased to the next lower whole number; and (b)&nbsp;the number and type of shares then reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be adjusted by substituting for the total nu
mber of shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock then reserved that number and type of shares of stock that would have been received by the owner of an equal number of outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock as the result of the event requiring the adjustment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If the Company shall be a party to any merger or consolidation or effect any recapitalization which causes a change in the Class&nbsp;A Stock which does not effect an adjustment under the prior paragraph, the Director Options Committee, in its discretion, may, if it considers it to be appropriate to carry out the intent and purpose of the Plan, make such adjustments in the nature or amount of securities subject to the Director Options or the Director Option price as it considers appropriate, and such adjustments shall be binding and conclusive of all holders of Options.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Except as expressly provided herein, the issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services either upon sale, or upon the exercise or rights or warrants to subscribe therefore, or upon conversion of other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Class A Stock then subject to outstanding Director Options.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Amendment or Termination of Plan</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Board of Directors of the Company may modify, revise or terminate this Plan at any time and from time to time, except that none of the term of the Plan, the eligibility of grantees, the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to this Plan, the amount of Directors Options to be granted to any director or the minimum option price shall, other than by operation of paragraph 12 hereof, be modified or revised without the consent of the holders of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock having a majority of the voting power. The termination of the Plan by the Board of Directors shall not affect any Director Options granted prior to such termination. The terms upon which Director Options are granted may not be amended more frequently than once every six months (except to comply with applicable tax or other laws).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Written Option Agreements</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each Director Option granted hereunder may be embodied in a written option agreement which shall contain such other provisions as the Director Options Committee in its discretion shall deem advisable. The failure to provide a written option agreement shall not affect the validity of Director Options provided for herein or the rights of directors to receive and exercise such options as herein provided.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Director and Stockholder Approval; Duration of Plan</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This Plan has been duly adopted by the Board of Directors on March&nbsp;14, 1996 and approved by the stockholders of the Company on May&nbsp;30, 1996. This Plan shall terminate on December&nbsp;31, 2010 or by earlier action of the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;13 hereof provided such termination shall not affect any Director Options granted prior to such termination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Election to Receive Shares If Subject to Detrimental Non-U.S. Income Tax Consequences</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If a person would be subject to significantly detrimental income tax consequences as a result of receiving Director Options under any non-United States income tax provisions, such person may elect (by written notice to the Director Options Committee prior to the date of grant) to receive in lieu thereof one share of Class&nbsp;A stock for every ten shares purchasable under the Director Options such person would otherwise have received.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Reference to Employee Stock Option Plan ("Employee Plan")</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;To the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, the terms and provisions of the Employee Plan shall apply to any options granted hereunder.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Plan Participation</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 3.1. <U>Eligibility</U>. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall designate, as of the effective date and as of the beginning of each Plan Year thereafter, each person that is eligible to make a Deferral Election under Section 4.1 (a "Participant").  Only those employees who are in a select group of management or are highly compensated (within the meaning of Title I of ERISA) may be designated as eligible to participate under this provision.  As a result of freezing the Plan, effective January 1, 2005, no employee shall become a Participant in the Plan after December 31, 2004.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 3.2. <U>Participation</U>. A person eligible to make a deferral election hereunder shall become a Participant by timely executing a deferral election form with the Committee.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Election to Defer</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;As a result of freezing the Plan, effective January 1, 2005, this Article IV no longer applies after such date. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.1. <U>Deferral Election</U>. (a) Prior to the first day of each Plan Year, each Participant nay elect to enter into a salary reduction agreement with the Company, no later than December 31 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Compensation to which the salary deferral election relates is earned.  In addition, prior to the beginning of the period to which a bonus relates, each Participant may elect to defer all or any portion of any bonus which he could earn in the following bonus period.  Each salary deferral election must be filed with the Committee as directed by the Committee. Completion of such election form shall evidence the Participant's authorization of the Company to reduce his Compensation and/or bonus by the amount specified in the election.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) &#9;The election to defer the receipt of Compensation or bonuses shall thereafter be irrevocable for such Plan Year.  If no election is made with respect to any Plan Year for which services have been rendered, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected not to defer any of his Compensation earned with respect to such Plan Year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) &#9;As soon as practicable after the end of each Plan Year but not later than January 31 of the next following Plan Year, the Committee will perform actual deferral percentage, actual contribution percentage and multiple use testing to determine the maximum amount of additional elective contributions that could be made for the current Plan Year, consistent with Section 402(g) of the Code, on behalf of each Participant as a participant in the Basic Plan.  The lesser of the maximum allowable contribution so determined or the Participant's salary deferral under the Plan for the current Plan Year will be paid to the Participant as soon as practicable, but in no event later than March 15 of the Plan Year following the current Plan Year unless the Participant previously elected for the current Plan Year to have such amount contributed to the Basic Plan as an elective contribution.  The Participant's election to have such amount contributed to the Basic Plan must be made at the same time as t
he Participant's election to enter into a salary reduction agreement with the Company under the Plan (which must be no later than December 31 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Compensation to which the salary deferral relates is earned).  If the Participant so elects, the Company shall cause that amount to be contributed directly to the Basic Plan.  No earnings credited under the Plan will be contributed to the Basic Plan.  All such elective contributions and matching contributions made to the Basic Plan shall result in corresponding debits to each affected Participant's Account under the Plan.  Any matching contributions associated with the elective contributions now made to the Basic Plan shall be in the same amounts as would be made if the elective deferrals were directly made to the Basic Plan, subject to the actual contribution and multiple use tests of Section 401(m) of the Code.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) &#9;Amounts paid to the Participant because such Participant does not elect to have such amounts contributed to the Basic Plan as an elective contribution will be includable in the Participant's gross income in the year in which the Compensation to which the salary deferral under the Plan relates was earned, and the Company will include this amount in the Participant's W-2 compensation for that year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) &#9;If a person becomes eligible to participate under this Article IV in the initial Plan Year or, if a new Participant becomes eligible to participate after a Plan Year has commenced, he may make an election to defer Compensation or bonuses related to services to be performed subsequent to his election by filing an election with the Committee.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.2. <U>Deferral Amount</U>. Each Participant for the Plan Year may elect to defer hereunder a percentage of his Compensation for the Plan Year; provided, however, in no event may the Participant's deferral under this Plan and the Basic Plan exceed more than ten percent of his Compensation for the Plan Year.  No amount shall be deferred under this Plan to the extent such amount is permitted to be deferred under the Basic Plan.  A Participant shall elect to defer such Compensation to his Retirement Deferral Account or his Education Deferral Account (both as defined below), in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.3. <U>Retirement Deferral Account</U>. The Committee shall establish and maintain a deferred compensation account (the "Retirement Deferral Account") with respect to each Participant who has elected to defer Compensation to such Retirement Deferral Account under this Article IV.  The Participant's Retirement Deferral Account shall be a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company and shall reflect the amount of Compensation or bonuses the Participant has elected to defer and the amount of the Company matching contribution which the Participant elects to have invested in the Retirement Deferral Account, and shall be credited or charged with the deemed investment earnings and losses thereon, if any, in accordance with Article VI.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.4. <U>Education Deferral Account</U>. The Committee shall establish and maintain a deferred compensation account (the "Education Deferral Account") with respect to each Participant who has elected to defer Compensation or bonuses to such Education Deferral Account under this Article IV.  The Participant's Education Deferral Account shall be a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company and shall reflect the amount of Compensation and bonuses the Participant has elected to defer and the amount of the Company matching contribution which the Participant elects to have invested in the Education Deferral Account, and shall be credited or charged with the deemed investment earnings and losses thereon, if any, in accordance with Article VI.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.5. <U>Fixed Payout Account</U>. The Committee shall establish and maintain a deferred compensation account (the "Fixed Payout Account") with respect to each Participant who has elected to defer Compensation or bonuses to such Fixed Payout Account under this Article IV.  The Participant's Fixed Payout Account shall be a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company and shall reflect the amount of Compensation and bonuses the Participant has elected to defer and the amount of the Company matching contribution which the Participant elects to have invested in the Education Deferral Account, and shall be credited or charged with the deemed investment earnings and losses thereon, if any, in accordance with Article VI.  </P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE V</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Company Matching Contribution</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Matching Contribution Credit</U>. The Company shall credit a matching contribution in an amount equal to the following, but based only on the first six percent of the amount deferred by the Participant under the Plan:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Years of Service</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">with the Company</U>&#9;<U>Company Match</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">less than 5 years&#9;40%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5 but less than 10 years&#9;50%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10 but less than 15 years&#9;60%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15 but less than 20 years&#9;70%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">20 but less than 25 years&#9;80%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">25 but less than 30 years&#9;90%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">30 or more years&#9;100%</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Participant's "years of service" shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the Basic Plan. Notwithstanding the above, with respect to any one year, in no event will a Participant be entitled to a matching Company contribution which is based on more than a total of six percent of his deferred contributions under the Basic Plan and this Plan combined.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of freezing the Plan, effective January 1, 2005, this Article V no longer applies after such date. </P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VI</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Earnings on Account Balances</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 6.1. (a) <U>Permitted Investments</U>. Each Participant shall designate from time to time, in such manner as may be satisfactory to the Committee, how the credits to his Accounts shall be deemed to be invested in one or more Permitted Investments.  Such credits shall be deemed to be invested as specified by the Participant either (i) on the day following the later of (A) the date such Participant makes such designation, or (B) the date such credit is made to such Participant's Account, or (ii) on such other dates as may be reasonably determined by the Committee.  In the event a Participant has not made a proper election, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected the investment funds selected by such Participant under the Basic Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) &#9;<U>Receipts</U>. Each Account shall be deemed to receive all interest, dividends, earnings and other property which would have been received with respect to a Permitted Investment deemed to be held in such Account if the Company actually owned such Permitted Investment.  Cash deemed received with respect to a Permitted Investment shall be credited to the Account as of the date it would have been available for reinvestment if the Company actually owned the Permitted Investment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) &#9;<U>Disposition</U>. Each Participant may elect from time to time, in such manner as may be satisfactory to the Committee, to dispose of any one or more Permitted Investments deemed to be held in his Account.  Such election shall be exercised in accordance with the guidelines established by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) &#9;<U>Elections</U>. All elections to be made by a Participant pursuant to this Article VI shall be made only by such Participant, provided that if such Participant dies before his entire Account Balance is distributed, or if the Committee determines that such Participant is legally incompetent or otherwise incapable of managing his own affairs, the Committee shall have the authority to (i) itself make the elections pursuant to this Section 6.1 on behalf of such Participant, or (ii) designate such Participant's designated beneficiary, legal representative or some near relative of such Participant to make the elections pursuant to this Section 6.1 on behalf of such Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) &#9;<U>Actual Investment Not Required</U>. The Company need not actually make any Permitted Investment.  If the Company should from time to time make any investment similar to a Permitted Investment, such investment shall be solely for the Company's own account and the Participant shall have no right, title or interest therein.  Accordingly, each Participant is solely an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to any amount distributable to him under the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 6.2. <U>Crediting of Deferrals</U>. The Company shall credit all deferred compensation to the Participant's Retirement, Education Deferral and/or Fixed Payout Accounts within a reasonable period following the date the deferrals would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant has not made a deferral election under Article IV of the Plan.  The Company shall also credit all Company matching contributions determined under Article V of the Plan within a reasonable period following the end of the Plan Year.  Earnings shall be credited to such Accounts in accordance with Section 6.1.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VII</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Establishment of Trust</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 7.1 <U>Establishment of Trust</U>. The Company may, in its sole discretion, establish a grantor trust, as described under section 671 of the Code, which is subject to the claims of the general creditors of the Company, for the purpose of accumulating assets to provide for the obligations hereunder.  The establishment of such a trust shall not affect the Company's liability to pay benefits hereunder except that the Company's liability shall be offset by any payments actually made to a Participant under such a trust.  In the event such a trust is established, the amount to be contributed shall be determined by the Company and the investment of such assets shall be in accordance with the trust document.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 7.2. <U>Status of Trust</U>. Participants shall have no direct or secured claim in any asset of the trust or in specific assets of the Company and will have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company for any amounts due under this Plan.  Trust assets and income will be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VIII</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Distribution of Account Balances</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.1. <U>Separation from Service</U>. If a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated as a result of his death or disability (as determined under the Company's long-term disability plan), the balance in his Retirement Deferral Account shall be 100% vested and nonforfeitable and shall be distributable to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant's death, to his beneficiary, as provided in Section 8.2 below.  If a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for any other reason, the balance in the Participant's Retirement Deferral Account that relates to his deferred contributions and the earnings related thereto shall be 100% vested and nonforfeitable and, the remaining balance in his Retirement Deferral Account shall be 100% vested after completing three years of service with the Company or any member of the controlled group of companies that includes the Company (as defined in Section 414 of the Code) (the "Controlled Group").  Such Account ba
lances shall be distributed in accordance with Section 8.2 below. For purposes of the Plan, a Participant's "years of service" shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Basic Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participants (i) whose employment is transferred from the controlled group that includes the Company to the controlled group that includes Actavis Group hf. on or about December 16, 2005, or (ii) who are employees involuntarily terminated as a result of the sale of the Company's generics business, shall become one-hundred (100%) vested in their Retirement Deferral Accounts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.2. <U>Form of Distribution of Retirement Deferral Account</U>. Upon a Participant's termination of employment, the vested portion of a Participant's Retirement Deferral Account shall be distributed, at the election of a Participant (i) in substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years or (ii) in a lump sum payment.  Such election shall be irrevocable and must be made at least one full calendar year prior to the date of the distribution of the Participant's Account balances.  Notwithstanding the above, if the vested portion of a Participant's Account distributable under this Section 8.2 has a value of less than $10,000 at the Participant's termination of employment, such amount shall be distributed in the form of a lump sum.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2006, upon a Participant's termination from employment, the vested portion of the Participant's Account shall be distributed in the form of a lump sum on or as soon as administ
ratively practicable following the date that is six months after such Participant's termination from employment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.3. <U>Distribution of Education Deferral Account</U>. If a Participant remains continuously employed by the Company until September 1 of the year in which his designated dependent (as defined below) attains age 18, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as possible after such September 1, and on each of the next three anniversaries thereof, a percentage of the vested portion of the Participant's Education Deferral Account.  Such percentages shall be irrevocably designated by the Participant at the time the Participant elects his first deferral to his Educational Deferral Account, and the sum of such four distribution percentages shall equal 100%.  If a Participant terminates employment for any reason prior to the complete distribution of his Education Deferral Account, the balance in his Education Deferral Account shall be distributed in accordance with Section 8.2 above in the same manner in which his Retirement Deferral Account is distributed.  If a designated depend
ent dies prior to full payment of the amount credited to a Participant's Education Deferral Account, the balance in such Account shall be paid to the Participant as soon as administratively possible following the death of the designated dependent.  A Participant shall always have a 100% vested and nonforfeitable interest in that portion of his Education Deferral Account which relates to his deferred contributions and the earnings related thereto.  A Participant shall be 100% vested in his Education Deferral Account after completing three years of service with any member of the Controlled Group.  For purposes of the above, a "designated dependent" shall be one dependent child of the Participant designated by the Participant who had not attained age 18 prior to September 1, 1994.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.4. <U>Distribution of Fixed Payout Account</U>. Upon the establishment of each Fixed Payout Account, a Participant shall designate, in the manner provided by the Committee, the distribution year for each Fixed Payout Account; provided that such election is made prior to January 1 of such payment year.  If a Participant remains continuously employed by the Company, the balance in each Participant's Fixed Payout Account shall be distributed in a lump sum no later than 90 days following the beginning of the designated payment year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than one time, each Participant may, in the Plan Year immediately preceding the year designated by such Participant as the distribution year for such Participant's Fixed Payout Account, elect to defer distribution of such Fixed Payout Account for a minimum of three additional years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.5. <U>Emergency Payments</U>. A Participant may from time to time request, in such manner as may be satisfactory to the Committee, that the Committee authorize an emergency payment to such Participant.  Any such distribution shall be for the sole purpose of enabling such Participant to meet his immediate and heavy financial needs arising as a result of personal injury, sickness, disability, substantial damage to real or personal property, or other unforeseen and extraordinary emergency of such Participant or a member of his immediate family.  Children's educational expenses and the purchase or improvement of a residence are specifically excluded as events deemed to constitute an emergency for purposes of this Section 8.4.  If an emergency payment is authorized, the Committee shall distribute to such Participant, within a reasonable time, an amount determined by the Committee to be sufficient to alleviate the financial hardship, but not in excess of the Participant's Account balan
ces as of such date.  In determining the amount to be distributed, the Committee may take into account amounts reasonably available from other resources of the Participant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the portion of a Participant's Accounts that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, he or she shall be permitted to elect a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency from his or her vested account, subject to the following restrictions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The election to take such a distribution shall be made by filing a form provided by and filed with Committee prior to the end of any calendar month.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Committee shall have made a determination that the requested distribution constitutes an Unforeseeable Emergency in accordance with the terms of the Plan and Section 409A of the Code, and that the amount of the distribution is not in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the extreme financial emergency, plus any tax liability associated with the payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The amount determined by the Committee as a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be paid in a single cash lump sum as soon as practicable after the end of the calendar month in which the distribution election is made and approved by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.6. <U>Involuntary Distributions</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII, the Committee may on its own initiative authorize the Company to distribute to any Participant (or to a designated beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) all or any portion of the Participant's Account Balances.  Such payment would be specifically authorized in the event there is a change in tax law, a published ruling or similar announcement issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a regulation issued by the Secretary of Treasury, a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction involving a Participant or a beneficiary, or a closing agreement made under section 7121 of the Code that is approved by the Internal Revenue Service and involves a Participant, and the Committee determines that a Participant has or will recognize income for Federal income tax purposes with respect to amounts deferred under this Plan prior to the time such amount are paid to the Participant.  N
otwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the portion of a Participant's Account that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, the Committee may on its own initiative authorize the Company to distribute to any Participant (or to a designated beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) all or any portion of the Participant's Accounts only in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.7. <U>Distribution Upon Change of Control</U>. Upon a Change of Control of the Company (as defined below) all amounts in Participant Accounts shall immediately be 100% vested and nonforfeitable and, within five days following the Change of Control of the Company, the Company shall make an irrevocable contribution to the grantor trust referred to in Section 7.1 hereof (if such grantor trust has been established) in an amount that is sufficient to pay each Participant or beneficiary the benefits to which Plan Participants or their beneficiaries would be entitled pursuant to the terms of the Plan as of the date on which the Change of Control occurred.  No Participant shall have a right to a distribution of his Accounts upon a Change of Control of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Plan.  A "Change of Control" of the Company shall mean the purchase or other acquisition by any person, entity or group of persons, within the meaning of section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securit
ies Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act"), or any comparable successor provisions, of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-1 promulgated under the Act) of 30 percent or more of either the outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of Company's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally, or the approval by the stockholders of Company of a reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case, with respect to which persons who were stockholders of Company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the reorganized, merged or consolidated Company's then outstanding securities, or a liquidation or dissolution of Company or of the sale of all or substantially all of Company's assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.8. <U>Designation of Beneficiaries</U>. Each Participant may name any person (who may be named concurrently, contingently or successively) to whom the Participant's Accounts under the Plan are to be paid if the Participant dies before the Accounts are fully distributed.  Each such beneficiary designation will revoke all prior designations by the Participant, shall not require the consent of any previously named beneficiary, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee and will be effective only when filed with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.  If a Participant fails to designate a beneficiary before his death, as provided above, or if the beneficiary designated by a Participant dies before the date of the Participant's death or before complete payment of the Participant's Account balances, the Committee, in its discretion, may pay the Participant's Account balances to either (i) one or more of the Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage and in suc
h proportions as the Committee determines, or (ii) the legal representative or representatives of the estate of the last to die of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IX</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Amendment or Termination</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 9.1. <U>Amendment</U>. The Company shall have the right to amend the Plan from time to time except that no such amendment shall, without the consent of the Participant to whom amounts have been credited to his Accounts, adversely affect the Participant's (and his beneficiary's) right to payments of such amounts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 9.2. <U>Plan Termination</U>. The Company may, in its discretion, terminate the Plan at any time, however, no such termination shall alter a Participant's (and his beneficiary's) right to the amounts previously credited to his Accounts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the portion of the Participant's Account that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, the Company may terminate the Plan only to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder and other guidance issued by the IRS, including but not limited to the following:  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) &#9;The Company may terminate the Plan within twelve (12) months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Section 331 of the Code, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section&nbsp;503(b)(1)(A), provided that the amounts deferred under the Plan are included in the Participants' gross incomes in the latest of</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&#9;The calendar year in which the Plan terminates;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)&#9;The calendar year in which the amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;The first calendar year in which payment is administratively practicable.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Company may terminate the Plan within the thirty (30) days preceding or the twelve (12) months following a change in control event (as defined under Prop. Treas. Reg. Section&nbsp;1.409A-2(g)(4)(i)).  The Plan may be terminated provided that all similar arrangements sponsored by the Company are terminated, so that Participants in the Plan and all participants in similar arrangements receive their entire amounts within twelve (12) months of the date of Plan termination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The Company may terminate the Plan provided that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&#9;All similar arrangements are terminated;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)&#9;No payments other than payments that would be payable under the terms of the Plan or similar arrangements, if the termination had not occurred, are made within twelve (12) months of termination;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;All payments are made within twenty-four (24) months of termination; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv)&#9;The Company does not adopt any new similar arrangement at any time within five (5) years following termination.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 10.4. <U>Plan not to Affect Employment Relationship</U>. Neither the adoption of the Plan nor its operation shall in any way affect the right and power of the Company to dismiss or otherwise terminate the employment or change the terms of the employment or amount of compensation of any Participant at any time for any reason or without cause.  By accepting any payment under this Plan, each Participant, former Participant, designated beneficiary and each person claiming under or through such person, shall be conclusively bound by any action or decision taken or made or to be taken or made under the Plan by the Committee.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 10.9. <U>Controlling Law</U>. The Plan shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New Jersey.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 10.10. <U>Successors</U>.
