     Part I

     Item 1.  Business

     a) General Development of Business

     AFP Imaging Corporation was organized on September 20, 1978, under the laws
     of the State of New York. Since such date, the Company has been engaged in
     the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and distributing
     equipment for producing medical and dental x-ray images by chemical
     processing photosensitive materials as well as manufacturing other closely
     related electro/optical imaging equipment. These products have been adapted
     to medical, industrial, dental and graphic arts applications. The Company's
     products are distributed to worldwide markets through a network of
     independent and unaffiliated dealers.

     As of June 30, 2001, the Company wrote-off the balance of the goodwill
     associated with the July 1995 acquisition of its medical diagnostic imager
     product line, to reflect changing technology and market conditions, in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This charge, of
     $846,000, is included in special charges in the accompanying Consolidated
     Financial Statements. The Company also recorded a charge of $200,000 to
     reduce the carrying value of the associated inventory to reflect the
     recognized impairment in the market value. This charge is included in cost
     of goods sold in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. See
     Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion
     and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for a further
     discussion.

     On July 30, 2001, the Company sold its graphic arts business and selected
     related assets to a third party for approximately $350,000, comprised of
     cash and a note receivable. As of June 30, 2001, the Company incurred a
     charge of approximately $110,000 due to the recognized impairment in the
     market value of the inventory associated with the graphic arts business and
     associated costs for the disposition of this business segment. These costs
     are included as special charges in the accompanying Consolidated Financial
     Statements.

     On September 21, 2001, the Company established a new three-year, $3.5
     million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new senior secured
     lender. The general terms, conditions, and covenants were modified from the
     previous credit facility, with the Company's former secured lender. See
     Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion
     and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for a further
     discussion.

     b) Financial Information about Industry Segments

     The Company was engaged in two industry segments: medical/dental and
     graphic arts, through July 2001. The Company is no longer engaged in the
     graphic arts industry, since the business and associated inventory and
     other assets were sold to a third party on July 30, 2001. The Company has
     agreed not to compete in this same business line of graphic arts film and
     plate processing equipment for ten years. The Company's business segments
     were based on differences in the nature of their operations, including
     distribution channels and customers. The composition of the segments is
     consistent with that used by the Company's management in making strategic
     decisions. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
     discussion of the Company's industry segments.

                                                                               2

     c) Narrative Description of Business

     Principal Products and Services

     Medical, Dental and Industrial X-Ray Processors & Accessories

     The Company manufactures and distributes a line of freestanding and table
     top medical, dental and industrial x-ray film processors. These machines
     are capable of processing or developing films of various sizes. The exposed
     film is inserted into equipment and returned to the operator developed,
     fixed, washed and dried. The equipment can be located either in a dark room
     site or adapted to a daylight loading system. These units are used for
     diagnostic x-ray imaging and industrial, non-destructive testing
     applications. The Company's products are distributed worldwide through an
     unaffiliated dealer network to doctors, dentists, hospitals, medical
     clinics, the U.S. military, and other facilities.

     Digital Dental Imaging Systems

     The Company manufactures and distributes a filmless digital dental
     radiography system, based on x-rays and electronic imaging technology. Such
     technology generates and captures a patient's dental images with an
     intraoral sensor and then displays the image on a computer screen that
     operates in a Windows-based software environment.

     The Company manufactures and distributes intraoral video dental cameras and
     related software. These products allow users to capture up to four
     intraoral dental images on a single computer screen and feature the
     mobility of the camera between operatories by "docking" (plugging in)
     directly into another chairside location. These products can be networked
     and are compatible with the Company's digital dental radiography system. A
     proprietary, Windows-based software suite provides for selection,
     transmission and manipulation of the desired images by the dentist.

     Diagnostic Imagers and Viewers

     The Company manufactures a line of multiformat compact cameras to
     permanently record and document the images produced during diagnostic
     examinations from several different applications. These cameras can record
     from one to nine images on a film that can be processed and developed in
     the Company's film processors.

     X-Ray Systems

     The Company has the worldwide distribution rights to a European-developed
     intraoral dental x-ray machine. The Company also has the North American
     distribution rights to a Japanese developed panoramic dental x-ray machine.
     The x-ray film exposed by each of these units is then developed in the
     Company's processors. These x-ray products also are compatible with the
     Company's digital x-ray products and software.

     Graphic Arts Processors

     The Company previously distributed various sized graphic arts processors,
     which developed different photosensitive materials such as rapid access
     film and papers. These processors are intended for use with
     phototypesetting, graphics and other pre-printing press applications.
     Newspapers, publishers and commercial printers are primary customers for
     these products. This product line was sold on July 30, 2001.


     Patents and Trademarks

     The Company presently holds many domestic and foreign utility patents,
     which, the Company believes, are material to the technology used in its
     products. The Company's intellectual property includes several patents
     acquired as part of acquisitions in 1997. The Company is not aware of any
     patents held by others that conflict with the Company's current product
     designs. The Company has agreed to pay a nominal royalty on the domestic
     sales of its digital dental systems to a third party under a license for
     the use of the third party's software format in the operation of one of the
     Company's systems. Such royalty payments have not been and are not
     anticipated to be material to the operations of the Company. The principal
     technology applied to the construction of the Company's other products is
     state-of-the-art and may be considered proprietary. Patent applications
     have been filed where appropriate. The Company owns several domestic and
     foreign trademarks, which it uses in connection with the marketing of its
     products. The Company utilizes various domestic and international forms of
     trademarks, including AFP Imaging, DENT-X, and Sens-A-Ray 2000, among
     others. The Company believes that these utility patents and trademarks are
     important to its operations and the loss or infringement by others of its
     rights to such patents and trademarks could have a material adverse effect
     on the Company.

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

     Research and Development

     The amounts spent by the Company during each of the Company's last three
     fiscal years on primary research activities relating to the development of
     new products and the improvement of existing products, all of which was
     Company sponsored, are as follows:

                       2001                2000                1999
                       ----                ----                ----
                     $457,172            $476,679           $1,205,461


     The Company conducts research and development activities internally as well
     as contracts certain projects to qualified vendors and expert consultants.
     The Company's research and development efforts and technologies have been
     enhanced by business acquisitions completed in Fiscal Years 1997 and 1998.
     In each of these transactions, the Company added new product lines, and
     gained proprietary technologies and access to future research and
     development benefits. Commencing in April 1997, the Company participated in
     the development of new video/x-ray imaging sensors, including but not
     limited to Close Coupled Device ("CCD") and Complimentary Metal Oxide
     Semiconductor ("CMOS") type sensors. Research and development costs for
     Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000 do not include the European Union ("EU") grants
     paid to the Company for the Company's participation in this research and
     development project. All dental applications resulting from the research
     under the project will be licensed exclusively to the Company. The EU
     contract expired in May 2000. However, the Company is continuing its
     research and development efforts previously conducted under the EU
     contract, with internally generated funds.

     The Company's level of research and development spending is discussed
     further in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
     Results of Operation.

     Raw Materials

     The Company does not utilize any unique or difficult to obtain raw
     materials or processes in the design and manufacture of its products. The
     Company anticipates that an adequate commercial supply of all raw materials
     will remain available from multiple sources. However, the Company owns
     proprietary designs and tooling to produce CCD and CMOS digital x-ray
     sensors, which are in the physical possession of a Company vendor.

     Sales, Marketing and Distribution

     All of the Company's products are manufactured and distributed domestically
     and internationally in two basic forms. Certain products are custom
     engineered for Original Equipment Manufacturer's ("OEM") customers and
     carry the respective OEM's brand label. The OEM's are responsible for the
     installation and servicing of OEM-labeled products. The balance of the
     Company's products are marketed under the Company's own trade names and are
     distributed through an extensive network of independent medical and dental
     dealers. These dealers install and service such products. The Company
     conducts worldwide marketing and regional sales management efforts to
     promote all of its products and brand names.

     The Company advertises in domestic and international trade journals,
     provides sales support and literature, prepares technical manuals and
     conducts customer education and training programs in order to promote its
     products. In addition, the Company participates in domestic and
     international trade and clinical shows.

     Government Regulation

     The United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulates the
     distribution of all equipment used as medical devices. The Company believes
     it has registered all of its applicable medical and dental products with
     the FDA. The FDA has the right to disapprove the marketing of any medical
     device that fails to comply with FDA regulations. The Company believes that
     its products and procedures satisfy all the criteria necessary to comply
     with FDA regulations. The Company's manufacturing facility is ISO
     (International Standards Organization) 9001 certified. Where applicable,
     the Company's products are Conformite' Europeenne ("CE") certified for
     sales in the European Union. Any future changes in regulations,
     domestically or internationally, governing devices such as the Company's
     medical and dental products could have a material adverse effect on the
     Company.

                                                                               4
<PAGE>

     Seasonal Nature

     The Company believes its business is not seasonal.

     Working Capital Practices

     The Company believes its practices regarding inventories, receivables or
     other items of working capital to be typical for the industries involved.
     In September 2001, the Company established a new three-year, senior secured
     credit facility with a new lender. The general terms, conditions, and
     covenants were modified from the previous agreement with the Company's
     former secured lender. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
     and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
     of Operation for further discussion.

     Customers

     No customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in Fiscal Years 2001,
     2000 or 1999. Management does not believe the loss of any one customer
     would have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
     business.

     Backlog Orders

     As of June 30, 2001, the Company's backlog of orders for its products was
     approximately $1,789,000 (excluding graphic arts orders) as compared to
     $5,394,000 as of June 30, 2000, which included graphic arts orders. The
     Fiscal 2000 backlog also included a government order of $1,354,000. All of
     the orders included in the backlog at June 30, 2001 are scheduled for
     delivery on or before June 30, 2002. OEM bulk purchase commitments are
     typically negotiated for 12-month periods and are not based on a calendar
     or fiscal year. Spare part sales are not part of the Company's backlog
     calculations. In the opinion of the Company, fluctuations in the backlog
     and its size at any given time are not necessarily indicative of
     intermediate or long-term trends in the Company's business. Much of the
     Company's backlog can be canceled or the delivery dates of orders can be
     accelerated or extended without penalty. Delivery of capital equipment is
     frequently subject to changing budget conditions of medical institutions or
     end user clinical practitioners.

     Government Contracts

     The Company has two current contracts with the United States Government
     that are material to the Company's consolidated business. One contract is
     with the Department of the Air Force for the delivery of Deployable X-ray
     Film Processors. The other contract, which is subject to a purchase option
     release provision, is with the Department of the Army for the delivery of
     Hand Held Dental X-ray Systems. The Company anticipates shipping these
     units during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2002. The Company's policy is
     to be responsive to all governmental Requests for Quotations (RFQ), which
     can be fulfilled within the scope of the Company's product lines.

     Competition

     The Company's products utilize mechanical, as well as analog and digital
     electronic, technologies. The Company is subject to both foreign and
     domestic competition. The competition is characterized by significant
     investment in research and development of new technologies, products and
     services. Some competitors are well established in the film processor
     manufacturing and distribution businesses and may have greater financial,
     distribution resources and facilities than the Company. The Company relies
     on internal research and development personnel as well as subcontracted
     vendors. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes on the
     basis of price, features, product quality, applications, engineering, and
     promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company also manufacturers
     and provides to OEM customers different product versions which may compete
     with Company-supplied products to other OEM, as well as Company-branded
     products. The Company purchases certain products from others for resale on
     a non-exclusive basis, which may be subject to competition from other
     independent distributors.

     The Company also competes in the dental imaging market also on the basis of
     its proprietary and patented technologies. Certain competitors have
     significant or greater resources and revenues in electronic digital imaging

     Environmental

     The Company believes it is in compliance with the laws and regulations
     governing the protection of the environment and that continued compliance
     would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or require any
     material capital expenditures. The Company believes it does not use any
     controlled or regulated materials or processes in its operation. Compliance
     with local codes for the installation and operation of the Company's
     products is the responsibility of the end user, or the dealer who
     independently provides installation services. See Item 3, Legal
     Proceedings, for further discussion on environmental claims.

     Employees

     As of June 30, 2001, the Company employed 106 persons worldwide on a
     full-time basis. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements and
     considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory.

     d) Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export
     Sales

     With respect to the Company's last three fiscal years, domestic sales were
     $18,819,770 (2001), $18,586,087 (2000) and $20,736,264 (1999) representing
     78%, 73% and 71%, respectively, of the Company's sales during such periods.
     Domestic operating loss was $1,260,835, $256,302 and $1,413,688 for the
     years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Export and foreign
     sales during such periods were $5,231,530 (2001), $6,780,911 (2000) and
     $8,634,074 (1999) or 22%, 27% and 29% of total Company sales for each
     period, respectively. The Company's Swedish subsidiary, Regam, incurred net
     losses of $24,950, $151,580, and $268,200 for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999.
     The Company's Swedish operation is currently inactive.

     Assets used in the manufacture of export sales are integrated with the
     other assets of the Company.

     Item 2.  Properties

     The Company's executive offices and principal manufacturing facility are
     located in Elmsford, New York. This property is under a lease expiring on
     December 31, 2008 at a current rental of $491,793 per year, with increases
     through the lease term to $525,085, plus increases in real estate taxes,
     utility costs and common area charges. The Company believes its facility is
     well maintained, is in good operating condition, and is sufficient to meet
     the Company's present and anticipated needs. The Company is obligated
     through January 2002 for a small sales and marketing facility in
     Springfield, Virginia, where its graphic arts subsidiary had been located,
     unless the property can be leased prior to such date. The Company closed
     its small office at a University in Sweden in June 2000. The cost of each
     of the Virginia and Swedish facilities have not been material to the
     Company's consolidated property costs.

     Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

     The Company is currently defending a civil complaint filed on December 18,
     1995 in Massachusetts in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts. Such complaint was instituted by a former vendor of Visiplex
     Instruments Ltd., for breach of New York State Bulk Sales Notice Law,
     alleging that no notice of the bulk transfer was given in July 1995, when
     the Company acquired selected assets and liabilities of Visiplex. In
     addition, the plaintiff alleges a claim concerning certain inventories and
     disputed invoices. The Company maintains these matters were settled in full
     by the plaintiff and Visiplex Instruments Ltd., (the seller) prior to the
     Company's acquisition, and that the Company did not assume such
     liabilities. The Company did pay the plaintiff $290,000 for undisputed
     invoices in the ordinary course of business following the July 1995
     closing. Visiplex Instruments Ltd. and the Company, simultaneously with the
     closing, entered into an Indemnification and Hold Harmless clause in the
     agreement, for the Company's benefit, which has a $500,000 limit. The
     amended complaint seeks damages in the sum of $443,500 for unpaid material
     invoices and $19.9 million in consequential damages, treble damages,
     interest and attorney fees. The Company's motion for summary dismissal of
     the amended claim was filed in July 2000. On September 27, 2000, the Court
     ruled on the Company's motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the
     Company on three of the six claims by the plaintiff. There will be a final
     pretrial conference on October 19, 2001, and the trial is scheduled to
     begin on December 3, 2001. The Company continues to deny there are any
     merits to the plaintiff's action, and intends to vigorously defend all the
     remaining three claims by pursuing due process under Massachusetts' law. At
     this time, the Company believes that the final outcome of this matter has
     the potential to have a material adverse effect on the Company, should
     there be a decision against the Company.

     The Company is involved in an insurance litigation case in Nevada, whereby
     the plaintiff and the insurance company claim that the Company's dental
     processor caused a fire on their premises. The Company maintains that the
     dental processor was not the cause of the fire or the damage indicated. The
     Company's insurance carrier, and their attorneys, are assisting in the
     Company's defense in this matter. The Company does not believe that the
     final outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the
     Company.

                                                                               6

     The Company recently received two separate claims regarding environmental
     issues relating to property in New Jersey owned by the Company between
     August 1984 and June 1985. One claim relates to a well, located on the
     property. In this matter, the Company believes it complied with New
     Jersey's ECRA law for property inspection and clean up, as required, at the
     time of sale of the property. The Company maintains that all environmental
     issues were complied with at the time of the sale, in accordance with New
     Jersey law. The second claim relates to an offsite location for the
     disposition of trash and waste. In an effort to settle this second matter,
     the Company has joined, along with numerous other involved companies, an
     alternative dispute resolution process for smaller claims. The Company is
     also investigating, with the help of its insurance agent and legal counsel,
     the applicable insurance coverage for the specific time period.

     The Company is party to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary
     course of business. The Company's insurance policies cover certain of these
     other claims and allegations. As such, the underwriter is vigorously
     assisting in the Company's defense in such matters. The Company does not
     believe that the final outcome of any of these matters, whether covered by
     insurance or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

     Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the
     fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2001.


                                                                               7

     Item 5.  Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder
     Matters

     a) Market Information

     The Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company is the only
     class of the Company's common equity securities outstanding and is traded
     on the OTC Bulletin Board (Symbol "AFPC"), maintained by the National
     Association of Securities Dealers Inc. The following table, based on
     information supplied by Commodity Systems Inc., shows the range of the high
     and low bid information for the Company's Common Stock for each quarterly
     period during the Company's last two fiscal years. These prices reflect
     inter-dealer prices and do not include retail mark-ups, markdowns or
     commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.

         December 31, 1999                          .47             .28
         March 31, 2000                             .87             .38
         June 30, 2000                              .81             .38
         September 30, 2000                         .88             .38
         December 31, 2000                          .59             .27
         March 31, 2001                             .39             .23
         June 30, 2001                              .34             .23

     b) Holders

     As of September 28, 2001, the closing bid price for the Common Stock, as
     reported on the OTC Bulletin Board Market, was $.29, and there were 475
     stockholders of record of the Common Stock. The Company estimates, based on
     surveys conducted by its transfer agent in connection with the Company's
     2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, that there are approximately 2,000
     beneficial holders of the Common Stock.

     c) Dividends

     No cash dividends have been declared on the Company's Common Stock to date
     and the Company anticipates that for the foreseeable future any earnings
     will be retained for use in its business. The Company currently is
     prohibited from paying cash dividends on its Common Stock, under the terms
     and conditions of its new senior secured credit facility. The Company does
     not currently have a set policy with respect to payment of dividends. Any
     future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the
     Board of Directors and the Company's senior secured lender, and will be
     dependent upon the Company's financial condition, results of operations,
     capital requirements and other relevant factors.

     d) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

     In connection with the establishment of its new three-year, $3.5 million
     senior secured revolving credit facility, as of September 21, 2001, the
     Company issued to the new senior secured lender warrants to purchase up to
     100,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, at an exercise price of $.32
     per share. These warrants, which expire on September 21, 2006, provide for
     "cashless exercise" and are subject to anti-dilution adjustment. The
     Company has granted specific "piggyback" registration rights with respect
     to the shares of the Company's Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
     warrants. The Company believes that these securities were issued in a
     transaction not involving a public offering in reliance upon an exemption
     from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

     Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
     Results of Operation

     The following should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated
     Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.

     Capital Resources and Liquidity

     The Company's working capital decreased approximately $1,157,000 between
     Fiscal Year 2001 and Fiscal Year 2000. The decrease mainly is due to a
     $590,000 decrease in inventory, and a $568,000 decrease in accounts
     receivable. These funds were used to repay the revolving debt.

     As of September 21, 2001, the Company established a new senior secured
     credit facility, (the "Revolving Credit Loan") consisting of a $3.5 million
     revolving line of credit, to replace its then current senior secured credit
     facility, which would have expired on October 31, 2001. The Company's
     former senior secured lender filed for Chapter 11 under the Bankruptcy Code
     and indicated to the Company that it did not intend to renew the credit
     facility in October 2001. The Revolving Credit Loan is secured by all of
     the Company's inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, life insurance
     policies and proceeds thereof, trademarks, licenses, patents and general
     intangibles. The Revolving Credit Loan requires that certain financial
     ratios and net worth amounts be maintained. The Revolving Credit Loan also
     provides for a decrease in the maximum amount of loan available under the
     revolving line of credit, an interest rate increase to 1-3/4% over the
     prime rate, the formula to calculate available funds based on eligible
     accounts receivable and inventory is stricter, and there are more reporting
     requirements to the senior secured lender, than under the Company's former
     credit facility. This Revolving Credit Loan provides for decreases in the
     interest rate charged on monies outstanding, currently at 7-1/4% per year,
     under specified circumstances. The Company is dependent upon the Revolving
     Credit Loan to finance its overall operations. At September 28, 2001, the
     Company had available $530,600 of unused credit under the Revolving Credit
     Loan.

     As of June 30, 2001, the Company was not in compliance with the terms and
     conditions of its former senior secured lender, as it did not meet the net
     worth covenant, or the debt service covenants.

     The Company's historical operating cash flows have been positive; however,
     the Company is dependent upon its credit facilities to finance its ongoing
     operations. The Company expects its need for working capital will continue
     to be financed by operations and from borrowings on its Revolving Credit
     Loan. The Company presently is unaware of any other trends, demands,
     commitments or contingencies which are reasonably likely to result in a
     material increase or decrease in its liquidity or capital resources in the
     foreseeable future, except for any ongoing losses from its operations and
     the final outcome of any pending litigation. No assurances can be given
     that the Company will have sufficient cash flow in the near or long term.

     Capital expenditures for Fiscal Year 2001 of approximately $203,000
     consisted of a new computer network system, individual computer workstation
     upgrades, and production tooling costs to upgrade and enhance the Company's
     dental product lines, leasehold improvement costs, and other appropriate
     replacements in the normal course of operations. The Company expects to
     finance any future capital requirements principally from internally
     generated funds. The total amount of capital expenditures is limited under
     the Revolving Credit Loan.

     Results of Operations - Fiscal 2001 vs. Fiscal 2000

     In March 2001, the Company implemented a re-organizational and
     re-structuring plan to better match the Company's resources with the
     then-current projected sales forecast. Termination notices were given to
     11% of its workforce, including both production and support employees. Cost
     reductions were implemented which included the elimination of attendance at
     an international show, reduced travel and communication expenses, and a
     continuation of a Company-wide cost savings program. Additionally, certain
     low margin products were discontinued. The Company expects to begin to
     realize the associated benefits beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal
     Year 2002, and did not incur any associated special charges during Fiscal
     Year 2001.

     Sales decreased by approximately $1,315,000 or 5.2 % between the two fiscal
     years. Sales by the Company's graphic arts business decreased $750,000 from
     the prior fiscal year. Due to the continuing decline in graphic arts sales,
     the Company decided to dispose of this business segment, and completed the
     disposition in July 2001. The Company's medical diagnostic imagers
     experienced a significant decrease in sales volume, of $1.5 million between
     the two fiscal years. This decrease is attributable to evolving technology
     and changing customer demands, changing market conditions, and expiration
     of purchase agreements by large OEM customers. Sales of dental product
     increased $900,000 between the two fiscal years. Included in the first
     quarter of Fiscal 2001, was a sale to the military of approximately $1.3
     million. Additionally, the Company had a full year of sales of its
     intraoral x-ray unit in Fiscal 2001, whereas this product was first
     marketed and sold beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2000. The
     analog medical and dental sales remained fairly current between the two
     periods.

                                                                              10

     Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased slightly, approximately .4
     percentage points. Included in material costs is a charge of $200,000 to
     reflect the lower realizable value of the medical diagnostic imager
     inventory. Excluding this distinct charge, gross profit, as a percent of
     sales would have increased slightly, approximately .4 percentage points.
     This improvement can be attributable to a reduction in overhead costs,
     changes in the product mix, and the stronger US dollar in Fiscal 2001.

     Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased approximately $199,000
     or 2.6% between Fiscal Year 2001 and Fiscal Year 2000. This decrease is due
     to management's efforts throughout the year to reduce expenses and
     eliminate redundant charges. The Company reduced attendance at several
     industry trade shows, and associated travel costs, based on current
     projected sales. As noted above, the Company anticipates further reductions
     in these costs in Fiscal 2002, based on projected sales levels.

     Research and development costs decreased slightly, approximately $19,000 or
     4% between the two fiscal years. The Company continues to invest in
     sustaining engineering and related costs for its analog products. Where
     applicable, the Company is acting as a master import distributor for
     products developed by others. The Company continues to focus on the
     refinement of its digital products in order to reduce costs and maintain
     market share.

     Special charges include approximately $846,000 to completely write-off the
     goodwill associated with the medical diagnostic imager product line. This
     line was acquired in July 1995, and due to changing technology and market
     conditions, the Company believes that there has been an impairment in the
     carrying value of this long-lived asset. Special charges also include a
     charge of $110,000 to accrue the closing costs associated with the sale of
     the graphic arts product line on July 30, 2001. These charges include
     $50,000 to reduce the graphic arts inventory to fair market value, and
     $60,000 related to severance, lease obligations, legal and other closing
     costs.

     Interest expense, net decreased approximately $35,000 or 7% between Fiscal
     2001 and Fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2001 included $33,000 of interest costs
     associated with a subordinated note, restructured in August 1999, and a
     higher interest rate (3/4%) on the credit facility after it was renewed in
     October 2000. The Company reduced its debt by $1,055,000 during the year,
     which reduced interest expense by approximately $40,000, and there were
     several decreases in the prime-borrowing rate during the last two quarters
     of the current fiscal year. As noted above, In September 2001, the Company
     established a new credit facility with a new lender. The interest rate
     under the new facility is slightly higher than the interest rate under the
     prior credit facility.

     The income tax provision primarily reflects nominal state taxes due. The
     Company did not recognize a tax benefit for the net loss in Fiscal 2001, as
     the Company does not meet the criteria described in statement of Financial
     Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" for recording
     such benefit.

     Results of Operations - Fiscal 2000 vs. Fiscal 1999

     Sales decreased by approximately $4,003,300 or 13.6% between the two fiscal
     years. The Company's product lines experienced a general decrease in sales
     volume, with the graphic arts business the most significant, due to
     continually evolving printing technology methods and changing customer
     demands. The dental lines were adversely affected during the year by an
     import restriction by the FDA on the manufacturer of the Company's
     intraoral x-ray unit. The Company selected a new unit for distribution,
     which became available to customers during the fourth quarter fiscal 2000.
     The Company maintained its level of dental sales during Fiscal 2000 by
     adding products for redistribution, aggressive marketing, and repositioning
     certain of its products in the market place.

     Gross profit as a percent of sales increased 1.84 percentage points.
     Material costs stayed relatively constant, and manufacturing overheads and
     labor were reduced as more distributor goods were sold and through
     management's efforts to reduce and eliminate redundancies in all
     operations.

     Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased $921,300 or 11%
     between the two fiscal years. Management has continued its financial
     restructuring plan to eliminate all non-essential expenses.

     Research and development costs decreased by approximately $729,000 or 60%.
     The Company closed its engineering office in Vancouver, Washington,
     effective June 30, 1999, and relocated the operations to the Elmsford, New
     York facility. The Company has continued to focus on the refinement of its
     digital products in order to reduce costs and maintain market share.
     Additionally, the Company continues to invest in sustaining engineering and
     related costs for its analog products. Where applicable, the Company is
     acting as a master import distributor for products developed by others.

                                                                              11

     Special charges included approximately $400,000 for the reduction in the
     carrying value of long-lived assets, principally the graphic arts
     inventory, to fair market value, based upon the signed letter of intent to
     sell these assets. Special charges also included $100,000 to reflect the
     restructuring and reduction in the principal amount of a Subordinated
     Promissory Note issued in 1997.

     Interest expense, net, decreased by approximately $184,000 or 28% between
     the two fiscal years. Corporate debt was reduced approximately $1.3 million
     since June 30, 1999. Additionally, two subordinated notes payable were
     reduced and restructured as of June 30, 1999, which further reduced
     interest expense.

     The income tax provision primarily reflects nominal state and foreign
     capital taxes due. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit for the net
     loss in Fiscal 2000, as the Company does not meet the criteria described in
     statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income
     Taxes" for recording such benefit.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Shareholders of
AFP Imaging Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AFP Imaging
Corporation (a New York Corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended June 30, 2001. These financial statements and the schedule referred
to below are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of AFP Imaging Corporation and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying
Accounts, is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.

AFP IMAGING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2001 AND 2000

1.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company

AFP Imaging Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, (the "Company") was
organized on September 20, 1978, under the laws of the State of New York. Since
its inception, the Company has been engaged in the business of designing,
developing, manufacturing and distributing equipment for generating, capturing
or producing medical and dental images by chemical processing photosensitive
materials as well as manufacturing other electro/optical imaging equipment.
These products have been adapted to medical industrial, dental and graphic arts
applications. The Company's products are distributed to worldwide markets
through a network of independent dealers and original equipment manufacturers.
The Company disposed of its graphic arts product line on July 30, 2001 (see Note
8).

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include AFP Imaging Corporation and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized by the Company when products are shipped and title passes
to the customer.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with original maturities of three
months or less.

Inventories

Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market (net realizable
value). At June 30, 2001 and 2000, inventories consist of the following:


                                                      2001            2000
                                                   ----------     ----------

        Raw materials and sub-component parts      $2,147,813     $3,367,576
        Work-in-process and finished goods          1,340,404        710,497

JUNE 30, 2001 AND 2000


Depreciation

Machinery and equipment are depreciated using straight-line and accelerated
methods over estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of 15
years or their estimated useful lives.

In connection with the Company's reduction and restructuring of its leased
premises during Fiscal 2001, the Company retired approximately $4.8 million of
fully depreciated assets.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. These costs
have been incurred in connection with the design and development of the
Company's products.

Goodwill

Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis, over a 15 year period.

The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and other
long-lived assets to determine whether an impairment may exist. The Company
considers relevant cash flow, estimated future operating results, trends and
other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of the asset
can be recovered. During Fiscal 2001 and 1999, the Company determined that the
value of certain of its goodwill was impaired (see Note 8). As of June 30, 2001,
the Company believes that no impairment of any other long-lived assets exists.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations have been translated
into United States dollars at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at the
end of the period reported. Revenues and expenses have been translated at the
applicable weighted average rates of exchange in effect during the period
reported. Translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Any transaction gains and losses are included in net
income.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.


                                                                             F-8

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Common Share

The computation of net earnings per common share is based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus, in periods
in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares contingently
issuable. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the fiscal years ended
2001, 2000 and 1999 are presented below:

potential exercise of 1,288,500, 1,675,500 and 1,147,620 stock options in Fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, as such amounts are antidilutive when there
is a loss.

Adoption of New Financial Standards

In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," which amends SFAS No.
133. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 established accounting and reporting
standards for derivative financial instruments. These standards did not have any
effect on the Company's financial statements, as it presently does not have any
derivative financial instruments.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), "Business
Combinations" and SFAS No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used
for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and prohibits the
use of the pooling-of-interests method after that date. SFAS No. 142 changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only
approach. The amortization of goodwill from past business combinations will
cease upon adoption of this statement on January 1, 2002. Goodwill and
intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed after June 30,
2001 must comply with the provisions of this statement. Companies will also be
required to evaluate all existing goodwill for impairment within six months of
adoption by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
value at the date of adoption. Any transitional impairment losses will be
recognized in the first interim period in the year of adoption and will be
recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company is
evaluating the potential impact of adopting these pronouncements on the results
of operations and financial position.

                                                                             F-9

2.   DEBT

During Fiscal 2001, the Company had a senior credit facility consisting of a
$4.5 million revolver and term loan facility. This facility was due to expire on
October 31, 2001. This facility required that certain financial ratios and net
worth amounts be maintained. At June 30, 2001, the Company was in compliance
with all of its covenants and terms, with the exception of the debt service
coverage ratio and net worth covenant.

On September 21, 2001, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit
facility with a new lender for $3.5 million to replace the expiring revolver.
The interest rate on revolving advances under this facility will be equal to the
Prime Rate plus 1.75%. This facility is due to expire on September 21, 2004.
This new facility is sufficient to finance the Company's ongoing working capital
requirements assuming that its losses from operations do not continue for a
material period of time. The new facility is secured by the Company's inventory,
accounts receivable, equipment, life insurance policies and proceeds thereof,
trademarks, licenses, patents and general intangibles. In connection with this
facility, the Company issued a 5-year warrant to the lender for the purchase of
100,000 shares of the Company's stock at $0.32 per share, subject to an
adjustment for all subsequent issuances of stock.

Upon execution of the new facility, the Company utilized the new facility to
repay the former revolver balance of $1,801,000. At September 21, 2001, after
repayment of the former revolver balance, the Company had available $700,200 of
unused lines of credit for short-term financing under the facility. As a result
of the new financing agreement, the former revolver and term loan were
classified as long-term as of June 30, 2001 in the accompanying balance sheet.

As of June 30, 2001 and 2000, debt consisted of the following:

        (a) For the period through and including June 2001, the term loan was
            paid in monthly payments of $16,213, representing the principal.
            During July 2001, the lender consolidated the term loan balance with
            the revolver, which was repaid in September 2001 with proceeds from
            the new facility discussed above.
        (b) This note payable consists of a $800,000 promissory note to ACG
            Nystromgruppen AB ("Nystrom"), the former parent of a Swedish dental
            company. Under the terms of this note, as amended (see Note 8)
            interest only will be paid quarterly for the first three years,
            followed by thirty-six equal monthly installments of $22,222 plus
            interest on the unpaid balance, beginning in May 2003. The Nystrom
            promissory note bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2% (6.71% at
            June 30, 2001).
        (c) This note represents a promissory note payable to the former owner
            of a dental product line, which the Company acquired in December
            1997. Under the terms of this note, as amended (see Note 8),
            $150,000 was due and paid on August 10, 1999, and the residual
            balance of $850,000 will be paid in 36 equal installments beginning
            in January 2002. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%.

from 103% to 145%; expected life of five years and risk-free interest rate
ranging from 4.38% to 6.78%.

At June 30, 2001, outstanding options had exercise prices ranging from $.25 to
$2.00 with a weighted - average remaining contractual life of six years.

Net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") will expire beginning in 2009. The
NOLs are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service. Future changes in
ownership of the Company, as defined by section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code, could limit the amount of NOLs available for use in any one year. The
Company recorded the above valuation reserve, based on management's conclusion
that it is more likely than not that future operations will not generate
sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets during the
carryforward period for these tax attributes.

5.   PROFIT SHARING PLAN

The Company maintains a defined contribution profit sharing plan and trust
pursuant to which participants receive certain benefits upon retirement, death,
disability and, to a limited extent, upon termination of employment for other
reasons. Allocation among participants' interests, including officers and
directors who are employees, is in accordance with Internal Revenue Service
regulations.

The aggregate amount contributed to the plan by the Company each fiscal year is
determined by the Board of Directors following a review of the profits of such
fiscal year. The plan requires no minimum contribution by the Company. The
Company has not made any contributions related to profit sharing for the years
ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

6.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants (together with other third
parties) in a legal claim alleging that the Company violated bulk sales laws
upon the acquisition of a medical product line in July 1995. The Company's
motion for summary dismissal of the amended claim was filed in July 2000. On
September 27, 2000, the Court ruled on the Company's motion and granted summary
judgment in favor of the Company on three of the six claims by the plaintiff.
There will be a final pretrial conference on October 19, 2001, and a trial is
scheduled to begin on December 3, 2001. The Company continues to deny there are
any merits to the plaintiff's action and will vigorously defend the remaining
three claims, by pursuing due process under law. At this time, the Company
believes that the final outcome of this matter has the potential to have a
material adverse effect on the Company, should there be a decision against the
Company. Furthermore, the Company has filed a cross claim against the seller
under an indemnification clause contained in the asset purchase agreement
between the two parties.

The Company is also a party to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary
course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend all such claims and
does not expect the outcome of these matters individually or in the aggregate to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations. The Company's insurance policies cover certain claims and
allegations and the underwriter is assisting in the Company's defense.

The Company has leases for office and manufacturing facilities for periods
expiring through fiscal year 2008. Approximate minimum annual rental payments
under these leases as of the fiscal year ended June 30 are as follows:

        2002                                $   477,000
        2003                                    477,000
        2004                                    501,000
        2005                                    525,000
        2006 and thereafter                   1,838,000

Rent expense was approximately $592,000, $582,000 and $708,000 for the years
ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

7.   SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company operates in two distinct industry segments: medical/dental and
graphic arts. The Company's business segments are based on differences in the
nature of their operations, including distribution channels and customers. The
composition of the segments and measure of segment profit is consistent with
that used in making strategic decisions.

Medical/dental segment operations are conducted under the Dent-X and AFP
tradenames and consists of the design, development, manufacturing and marketing
of medical and dental image systems and all related accessories. The graphic
arts segment operates under the LogE tradename and includes products such as
paper and film developers (see Note 8).

                                                                            F-14

8.   SPECIAL CHARGES

During 2001, the Company recorded a special charge of approximately $846,000 to
write-off the balance of goodwill associated with the July 1995 acquisition of
its medical diagnostic imager product line, due to impairment of this product
line caused by changing technology and market conditions. Also in July 2001, the
Company completed the sale of its LogE graphic arts product line at a loss of
approximately $110,000. This amount is included in special charges and is
comprised of $50,000 to reduce the inventory to fair market value and $60,000
for severance and other closing costs. Special charges in Fiscal 2000 included a
provision of $400,000 to reduce the carrying value of the LogE inventory to fair
market value, based upon a signed letter of intent to sell these assets and the
Company's intention to exit this product line at that time.

Special charges in Fiscal 2000 also included a benefit of $100,000 to reflect
the restructuring and reduction of a Subordinated Promissory Note issued in 1997
as part of the financing of an acquisition. On August 11, 1999, the Company and
ACG Nystromgruppen AB ("Nystrom") of Sweden, agreed to an immediate reduction
and restructuring of the Nystrom Subordinated Note Payable. The Company paid
$100,000 to Nystrom plus accrued interest from April 17, 1999 to August 10,
1999, and the principal amount of the amended Nystrom Subordinated Note Payable
was reduced by $100,000 (See Note 2) to $800,000 in total, to be paid over a six
year period. A royalty payment, contingent on sales, as per the original Stock
Purchase Agreement was due Nystrom and paid on April 17, 2000. There are no
other contingent payments or further amendments to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

On January 4, 1999, $500,000 became due under the Company's $2.5 million
promissory note issued to the former owner of a dental product line. The Company
did not make payment on that note as the Company believed that the former owner
breached the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 24, 1997
related to the acquisition of the dental product line. During Fiscal 1999, the
Company and the former owner reached a commercial settlement whereby the $2.5
million note would be extinguished and replaced with an $850,000 note and a
payment of $150,000, the terms of which are discussed in Note 2. At the time the
settlement was reached, the carrying value of the $2.5 million note was
approximately $2.3 million, net of unamortized discount. The resulting $1.3
million reduction in the carrying value of the debt was recorded as a component
of the special charges in 1999.

During Fiscal 1999, the Company recorded special charges of approximately $2.1
million related to the operations of the dental product line acquired in 1997,
due to the recognized impairment in the value of this product line. The
components of these charges were as follows:

    o    Approximately $1.3 million write down of goodwill, reducing the
         carrying amount of this asset to $0,

    o    Approximately $140,000 reduction in the carrying value of other
         acquired long-lived assets, principally equipment, to fair market
         value,

    o    Approximately $530,000 to establish reserves related to acquired
         accounts receivable and inventory, the value of which not having yet
         been realized through collection or sale, to reduce the carrying
         amounts of these assets to net realizable value, and

    o    Approximately $75,000 to establish a liability for the discontinuation
         of the former owner's consulting agreement with the Company, pursuant
         to the settlement arrangement.


                                                                            F-16

These special charges, which were recorded during the fiscal third and fourth
quarters of Fiscal 1999, were based on revised sales forecasts, historical
operating results and the progression of the Company's dispute in regard to the
note payment due to the prior owner. The amount of the charge related to the
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets was calculated using the
anticipated future discounted cash flows, as a proxy for fair value, of this
product line.

THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES ISSUABLE HEREUNDER HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER SUCH ACT
OR PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE
CORPORATION AND ITS COUNSEL THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

                            WARRANT TO PURCHASE STOCK


Corporation:                   AFP Imaging Corporation, a New York corporation
Number of Shares:              100,000
Class of Stock:                common
Initial Exercise Price:        $0.32 per share
Issue Date:                    As of September 21, 2001
Expiration Date:               September 21, 2006

THIS WARRANT CERTIFIES THAT, in consideration of the payment of $1.00 and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, Keltic Financial Partners, LP or registered assignee ("Holder") is
entitled to purchase the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the
Class of Stock (the "Shares") of the corporation (the "Company") at the Initial
Exercise Price per Share (the "Warrant Price") all as set forth above and as
adjusted pursuant to Article 2 of this Warrant, subject to the provisions and
upon the terms and conditions set forth of this Warrant.



<PAGE>



ARTICLE 1.                 EXERCISE

         1.1 Method of Exercise. Holder may exercise this Warrant in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time prior to the Expiration Date by
delivering this Warrant and a duly executed Notice of Exercise in substantially
the form attached as Appendix I to the principal office of the Company located
at 250 Clearbrook Road, Elmsford, New York, NY 10523, or such other office as
the Company shall advise Holder, as herein provided. Unless Holder is exercising
the conversion right set forth in Section 1.2, Holder shall also deliver to the
Company a check for the aggregate Warrant Price for the Shares being purchased.
In the event the Warrant is not exercised in full, the Company, at its expense,
shall forthwith issue and deliver to or upon the order of Holder a new Warrant
of like tenor and date in the name of Holder or as Holder may request, calling
in the aggregate on the face thereof for the number of Shares equal (without
giving effect to any adjustment therein) to (i) the number of Shares called for
on the face of this Warrant minus (ii) the number of Shares for which this
Warrant shall have been exercised without giving effect to any adjustment in the
number as a result of changes in the Warrant Price.

<PAGE>

         1.2 Conversion Right. (a) In lieu of exercising this Warrant as
specified in Section 1.1, Holder may from time to time convert this Warrant (the
"Conversion Right"), in whole or in part, into a number of Shares determined by
dividing (a) the aggregate fair market value of the Shares or other securities
otherwise issuable upon in full or such part of this Warrant exercise of this
Warrant minus the aggregate Warrant Price of such Shares by (b) the fair market
value of one Share. The fair market value of the Shares shall be determined
pursuant to Section 1.5. (b). The Conversion Right may be exercised by Holder,
at any time, or from time to time, prior to the Expiration Date, on any business
day by delivering a written notice (the "Conversion Notice") in the form
attached as Appendix II to the Company at its principal office exercising the
Conversion Right and specifying (i) the total number of Shares Holder will
purchase pursuant to such conversion and (ii) a place and date not less than
three nor more than 20 business days from the date of the Conversion Notice to
the closing of such purchase.

         1.3 Payment of Taxes. The Company shall pay all documentary stamp
taxes, if any, attributable to the issuance of the Warrant and the Shares;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or
taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in (a) the
issuance of any Warrant in the name other than Holder (b) the issue of any
certificates for Shares in a name other than that of Holder upon exercise of the
Warrant, or any portion thereof or (c) upon exercise of any new warrant issued
in accordance with Section 1.1, and the Company shall not be required to issue
or deliver such certificates unless and until the persons requesting the
issuance thereof have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been
paid.

         1.4 Intentionally Omitted

         1.5 Fair Market Value. If the Shares are traded regularly in a public
market, the fair market value of the Shares shall be the closing price of the
Shares (or the closing price of the Company's stock into which the Shares are
convertible) reported for the business day immediately before Holder delivers
its Notice of Exercise to the Company. If the Shares are not regularly traded in
a public market, the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine fair
market value in its reasonable good faith judgment. The foregoing
notwithstanding, if Holder advises the Board of Directors in writing that Holder
disagrees with such determination, then the Company and Holder shall promptly
agree upon a reputable investment banking firm to undertake such valuation. If
the valuation of such investment banking firm is greater than that determined by
the Board of Directors, then all fees and expenses of such investment banking
firm shall be paid by the Company. In all other circumstances, such fees and
expenses shall be paid by Holder.


                                       2
<PAGE>


         1.6 Delivery of Certificate. Promptly after Holder exercises or
converts this Warrant, the Company shall deliver to Holder certificates for the
number of fully paid and non-assessable Shares acquired in the name of Holder or
its designee(s).

         1.7 Replacement of Warrants. On receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an
indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company
or, in the case of mutilation, or surrender and cancellation of this Warrant,
the Company at its expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant a
new warrant of like tenor.

         1.8 Repurchase on Sale, Merger, or Consolidation of the Company.

              1.8.1 "Acquisition." For the purpose of this Warrant,
"Acquisition" means any sale, license, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets (including intellectual property) of the
Company, or any reorganization, consolidation, or merger of the Company where
the holders of the Company's securities before the transaction beneficially own
less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity after
the transaction.

              1.8.2 Assumption of Warrant. Upon the closing of any Acquisition
the successor entity assumes the obligations of this Warrant, then this Warrant
shall be exercisable for the same securities, cash, and property as would be
payable for the Shares issuable upon exercise of the unexercised portion of this
Warrant as if such Shares were outstanding on the record date for the
Acquisition and subsequent closing. The Warrant Price shall be adjusted
accordingly. The Company shall not consummate any Acquisition unless the
acquiring or surviving entity assumes, by written instrument executed and
delivered to Holder, the obligations of this Warrant.

ARTICLE 2. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHARES.

         2.1 Stock Dividends, Splits, Etc. If the Company declares and pays a
dividend on its common stock payable in common stock or other securities or
subdivides the outstanding common stock into a greater amount of common stock,
then upon exercise or conversion of this Warrant, for each Share acquired,
Holder shall receive, without cost to Holder, the total number and kind of
securities to which Holder would have been entitled had Holder owned the Shares
of record as of the date the dividend or subdivision occurred.


                                       3
<PAGE>


         2.2 Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. Upon any
reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event that results in a
change of the number and/or class of the securities issuable upon exercise or
conversion of this Warrant, Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise
or conversion of this Warrant. the number and kind of securities and property
that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant had been
exercised immediately before such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or
other event. The Company or its successor shall promptly issue to Holder a new
Warrant for such new securities or other property. The new Warrant shall provide
for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the
adjustments provided for in this Article 2 including, without limitation,
adjustments to the Warrant Price and to the number of securities or property
issuable upon exercise of the new Warrant. The provisions of this Section 2.2
shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, exchanges, substitutions,
or other events.

         2.3 Adjustments for Combinations, Etc. If the outstanding Shares are
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number
of shares, the number of Shares subject to this Warrant shall be proportionately
decreased and the Warrant Price shall be proportionately increased.

         2.4 Treasury Shares. For the purposes of this Article 2, the number of
Shares at any time outstanding shall not include the Shares held in the treasury
of the Company.

         2.5 No Impairment, The Company shall not, by amendment of its
Certificate of Incorporation or through a reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue, or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of
the terms to be observed or performed under this Warrant by the Company, but
shall at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all the provisions of
this Article 2 and in taking all such action as may be necessary or appropriate
to protect Holder's rights under this Article against impairment. If the Company
takes any action affecting the Shares or its common stock other than as
described above that adversely affects Holder's rights under this Warrant,
including the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Price
shall be adjusted downward and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of
this Warrant shall be adjusted upward in such a manner that the aggregate
Warrant Price of this Warrant is unchanged but the number of Shares is increased
so that if this Warrant was exercised in full Holder would receive shares of
Common Stock equal in percentage to the percentage that the Shares bear to the
outstanding shares of Common Stock on the original issuance date of this
Warrant.

                                    EXHIBIT C

                               Registration Rights


         Holder shall have the following Registration Rights relating to shares
held by Holder pursuant to exercise of this Warrant ("Holder Shares").

         (1) Registration. If the Company at any time proposes for any reason to
register authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock held by the Company in
its treasury ("Primary Shares") or shares issued to ______________ ("Registrable
Shares") under the Securities Act (other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8
promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor forms thereto), it shall
promptly give written notice to holders of the Company's Common Stock that are
contractually entitled to request registration of shares of Common Stock, of its
intention to so register the Primary Shares or Registrable Shares and, upon the
written request, given within 20 days after delivery of any such notice by the
Company, of Holder to include in such registration Holder Shares (which request
shall specify the number of Holder Shares proposed to be included in such
registration), the Company shall use its best efforts to cause all such Holder
Shares to be included in such registration on the same terms and conditions as
the securities otherwise being sold in such registration; provided, however,
that if the managing underwriter advises the Company that the inclusion of all
of the Primary Shares, Holder Shares and other unregistered shares ("Other
Shares") proposed to be included in such registration would interfere with the
successful marketing (including pricing) of Primary Shares or Registrable Shares
proposed to be registered by the Company, then the number of Primary Shares,
Registrable Shares, Holder Shares and Other Shares proposed to be included in
such registration shall be included in the following order:

                  (i)      first, the Primary Shares;

                  (ii)     second, the Registrable Shares, and

                  (iii)    third, the Holder Shares and Other Shares.

         (2) Expenses. With respect to each registration effected, all fees,
costs and expenses of and incidental to such registration and the public
offering in connection therewith shall be borne by the Company; provided,
however, that the Holder participating in any such registration shall bear the
underwriting discounts and selling commissions attributable to the shares of
Holder's Registrable Stock sold in such public offering.

         (3)      Indemnification and Contribution.

                  (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will
         indemnify and hold harmless Holder and any underwriter (as defined in
         the Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the "Securities Act") acting
         for Holder, and any person who controls such Holder or such underwriter
         within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against, and will
         reimburse


                                       12
<PAGE>


         Holder and each such underwriter and controlling person with
         respect to, any and all claims, actions, demands, losses, damages,
         liabilities, costs and expenses to which Holder or any such underwriter
         or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or
         otherwise, insofar as such claims, actions, demands, losses, damages,
         liabilities, costs or expenses arise out of or are based upon any
         untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
         contained in any Registration Statement, any prospectus contained
         therein or any amendment or supplement thereto in which shares of the
         Holder are included, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
         alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
         arise out of any violation by the Company of any rule or regulation
         under the Securities Act applicable to the Company and relating to
         action or inaction required of the Company in connection with such
         registration; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in
         any such case to the extent that any such claim, action, demand, loss,
         damage, liability, cost or expense is caused by an untrue statement or
         alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in
         reliance upon and in strict conformity with information furnished by
         Holder, such underwriter or such controlling person in writing
         specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

         (b) If shares of Holder are included in a registration, Holder will
         indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against, and will
         reimburse the Company with respect to, any and all losses, damages,
         liabilities, costs or expenses to which the Company may become subject
         under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, damages,
         liabilities, costs or expenses are caused by any untrue or alleged
         untrue statement of any material fact contained therein or any
         amendment or supplement thereto, or are caused by the omission or
         alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
         circumstances in which they are made, not misleading, in each case to
         the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or
         alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was so made in
         reliance upon and in strict conformity with written information
         furnished by Holder specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

         (c) Promptly after receipt by a party to be indemnified pursuant to the
         provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) (an indemnified party) of notice of
         the commencement of any action involving the subject matter of the
         foregoing indemnity provisions, such indemnified party will, if a claim
         thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party pursuant to the
         provisions of paragraph (a) or (b), notify the indemnifying party of
         the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
         indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may
         have to an indemnified party otherwise than under the provisions of
         this paragraph and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from
         liability under the provisions of this paragraph unless such
         indemnifying party is prejudiced by such omission. In case such action
         is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the
         indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party
         shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent that it may
         wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to
         assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
         such indemnified party,



                                       13
<PAGE>

         and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
         of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
         party will not be liable to such indemnified party pursuant to the
         provisions of such paragraphs (a) and (b) for any legal or other
         expense subsequently incurred by indemnified party in connection with
         the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No
         indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified party for any
         settlement of any action or claim without the consent of the
         indemnifying party; no indemnifying party may unreasonably withhold its
         consent to any such settlement. No indemnifying party will consent to
         entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not
         include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
         plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in
         respect to such claim or litigation.

         (4) Lock-Up Agreement. In consideration of the assumption by the
         Company of its obligations hereunder, Holder agrees in connection with
         any registration of the Company's securities that, upon the request of
         the Company or the underwriter or any underwritten offering of the
         Company's securities, not to sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant
         any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any Registrable
         Stock (other than those included in the registration) without the prior
         written consent of the Company or such underwriters, as the case may
         be, for such period of time (not to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
         days) from the effective date of such registration as the Company or
         the underwriters may reasonable specify.

         Within the limits of the Borrowing Capacity, and subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, Borrowers may borrow, repay and
reborrow Advances.

         2.2 Letter of Credit. At the request of Borrowers, and upon execution
of Letter of Credit documentation satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer,
Lender, within the limits of the Borrowing Capacity as then computed, shall
arrange for the issuance by the Letter of Credit Issuer of Letters of Credit
from time to time for the account of any Borrower in amounts not exceeding in
the aggregate at any one time outstanding the amount of $138,000.00. Lender

in an outstanding principal amount exceeding the Maximum Facility; however, it
is agreed that should the Obligations of Borrowers to Lender incurred under the
Revolving Loan or otherwise exceed that figure or any other limitation herein
set forth, including without limitation, the Borrowing Capacity, all such
obligations shall (a) constitute Obligations under this Agreement, (b) shall be
entitled to the benefit of all security and protection under this Agreement and
all Loan Documents and secured by the Collateral and (c) shall be payable
immediately upon demand by Lender.

         2.4 Reserves. The borrowing limits set forth in Section 2.1 above and
otherwise herein, shall be subject to such reserves as Lender reasonably shall
deem necessary and proper in Lender's sole and absolute discretion. Reasonable
reserves may be established by Lender from time to time in such manner
(including reduction of the rate of Revolving Advances under Section 2.1 hereof)
and for such reasons as Lender may determine from time to time in Lender's sole
and absolute discretion and Lender shall notify Borrowers thereof. Payments,
deposits, guaranties or indemnifications made by Lender under any reimbursement
agreement, guaranty or similar instrument made in respect of any such instrument
may be treated by Lender as Revolving Advances to Borrowers hereunder.

via facsimile or electronic transmission, including via e-mail, by a Notice of
Borrowing executed by an authorized officer of Borrowers, not later than 11:00

warranties and covenants as requested by Lender under Section 17.2 hereof, and
Borrowers shall have sufficient Borrowing Capacity to permit an Advance
hereunder in accordance with Section 2.1 hereof, Lender shall make the Advance
to Borrowers or any one of them as set forth in the request in the amount
requested in such Record by Borrowers in immediately available funds for credit
to any account of Borrowers (other than a payroll account) at a bank in the
United States of America as Borrowers may specify (provided, however, that
Borrowers shall pay Lender its usual and customary fees for such transfer).
Lender shall not be responsible for any failure of any amount so transferred to
be credited to any such account, unless such failure is due to Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

         2.6 Evidence of Borrowers' Obligations. Borrowers' joint and several
obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Revolving Advances made
to Borrowers shall be evidenced by the Revolving Note executed by Borrowers and

be charged by Lender to Borrowers' account, charged as an Advance or made by
Borrowers to Lender in U.S. currency and without any defense, offset or

York 10580, or to such other address as Lender shall specify, by 12:00 noon New
York, New York time on the date when due. Whenever any payment to be made is due

interest in connection with any such payment. Lender may make an Advance to
reimburse itself for any payments on the Obligations (including fees and
expenses payable jointly and severally by Borrowers) which are not paid when
due, without notice or demand to Borrowers.

                    withdrawal. All proceeds of Receivables whether cash,
                    checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other forms of
                    payment, if received by Borrowers, shall be received by
                    Borrowers in trust for Lender, and Borrowers agree to

to Lender in cash or solvent credits of the items giving rise to them and, if
any item is not so paid, the amount of any credit given for it shall be charged
to the balance of the Revolving Loan whether or not the item is returned; and
(iv) for the purpose of computing interest on the Revolving Loan and other
Obligations, interest shall continue to accrue on the amount of any payment

contrary, the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loans, plus all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all fees and other amounts payable under

2001 on the average daily unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Advances made
to Borrowers at a fluctuating rate which is equal to the Prime Rate plus one and
three quarter of one percent (1.75%) per annum; provided that, the interest rate
will be reduced: (a) by one quarter of one percent (.25%), effective on the date
that Borrowers actually deliver to Lender the financial statements for
Borrowers' fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2001 in accordance with Section 8.4
below; and (b) by an additional one quarter of one percent (.25%), effective on
the date that Borrowers actually deliver to Lender the financial statements for
Borrowers' fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001 in accordance with Section 8.4
below, in each case so long as (i) no Event of Default has occurred hereunder at
any time during the immediately preceding quarter, which means in the case of
(a) above, from September 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001; and in the case of
(b) above, January 1, 2002 through March 31, 2002; (ii) said financial
statements evidence that Borrowers

<PAGE>



have Operating Income of $0.00 or greater for each such quarter; and (iii)
Borrowers have average excess availability against the Maximum Facility during
the last month of each such quarter in an amount of $500,000.00 or more as

contrary notwithstanding, however, if for any fiscal quarter Borrowers have a
negative Operating Income as evidenced by Borrowers' financial statements
delivered by Borrowers to Lender in accordance with Sections 8.3 and 8.4 hereof,
the rate of interest shall automatically revert to the Prime Rate plus one and
three quarter of one percent (1.75%) per annum. All adjustments in the interest
rate shall be made as of the date that Borrowers actually deliver to Lender such
financial statements. Furthermore, notwithstanding all of the foregoing, on and
after the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, Borrowers shall pay
interest on all outstanding Obligations at a rate which is three percent (3.0%)
per annum above the interest rate which would otherwise be in effect under this
Agreement with respect to the Revolving Advances; provided, however, in no event
shall any interest to be paid hereunder or under any Loan Document exceed the
maximum rate permitted by law.

face amount of such Letter of Credit, payable monthly in arrears on the first
day of each calendar month with respect to the immediately preceding calendar
month or portion thereof, commencing on the first such date following the
issuance of such Letter of Credit.

         3.6 Field Examination Fees. Borrowers shall promptly reimburse Lender
for all costs and expenses associated with periodic field examinations and fixed
asset appraisals performed by Lender and its agents, as deemed necessary by

appraisals within five (5) days.

         3.7 Prepayment Premium. If Borrowers prepay the principal of the
Revolving Loan (other than from time to time from working capital or through
payments made from the Blocked Account), which prepayment would have the effect
of terminating the financing arrangements hereunder and require Lender to
deliver UCC-3 termination statements and other release instruments, Borrowers
shall pay to Lender at the time of such prepayment, a prepayment


                                       14

the prepayment is made on or before the date which is the first anniversary of
the date hereof, two percent (2.0%) of the Maximum Facility if the prepayment is
made after the first anniversary of the date hereof, but on or prior to the
second anniversary of the date hereof, one percent (1.0%) of the Maximum
Facility if the prepayment is made after the second anniversary of the date
hereof, except that no prepayment premium shall be required in connection with:
(a) any prepayment required under Section 15.3 of this Agreement; or (b) so long
as there is no Event of Default hereunder, any termination of this Agreement by
Lender.

         3.8 Computation of Interest and Fees. All interest and fees hereunder
shall be computed on the basis of a year consisting of three hundred sixty (360)
days for the number of days actually elapsed.

         3.9 Payment of Interest and Fees. Interest and fees shall be payable
immediately when due, and may be paid by Lender's making an Advance in the
amount of the interest and/or fee due against the Revolving Loan, but any
failure or delay by Lender in submitting any invoice for such interest or fee or
in the making of an Advance against the Revolving Loan shall not discharge or
relieve Borrowers of its obligation to make such interest or fee payment.

4.       APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Revolving Advances shall

purchasing or carrying any margin security or for the purpose of reducing or
retiring any indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry

proceeding is now pending or, to the knowledge of Borrowers, is threatened
against Borrowers or any Corporate Guarantor at law, in equity or otherwise,

10.      SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO INVENTORY.

         10.1 Warranties With Respect to Inventory. Borrowers represent and
warrant to Lender that (i) all representations made by Borrowers to Lender and
all documents and schedules given by Borrowers to Lender, relating to the
description, quantity, quality, condition and valuation of Inventory are true
and correct, and (ii) Borrowers have not received any Inventory on consignment
unless Borrowers have notified Lender thereof in a Record, have marked such
Inventory on consignment or have segregated it from all other Inventory, and
have appropriately marked its records to reflect that such Inventory is held on
consignment.

         10.2 Lender's Rights in Inventory. Lender's security interests in the
Inventory shall continue through all steps of manufacture and sale and attach
without further act to raw materials, work in process, finished goods, returned
goods, documents of title, warehouse receipts, and to proceeds resulting from
sale or disposition of Inventory. Until all Obligations of Borrowers to Lender
have been satisfied, Lender's security interest in Inventory and in all proceeds
thereof shall continue in full force and effect. Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, Lender shall have, in its discretion and at any time, the right to
take physical possession of the Inventory and to maintain it on Borrowers'
premises, in a public warehouse, or at such place as Lender may remove the
Inventory or any part thereof. If Lender exercises its right to take possession
of Inventory, Borrowers will, upon demand, and at Borrowers' own cost and
expense assemble the Inventory and make it available to Lender at a place or
places convenient to Lender.

dispose of or permit the sale, encumbrance, return or disposal of any Inventory
(except in the normal course of business) without Lender's prior consent in an
Authenticated Record. If sales are made for cash, Borrowers shall immediately
deliver to Lender the identical checks or other forms of payment which it
receives. In the event that Inventory is stored with the manufacturer thereof,
Borrowers shall cause such manufacturer to enter into a no off-set agreement
with Lender which agreement is in form and substance satisfactory to Lender.

Lender's security interest in the Inventory, including, but without limitation,
placing and maintaining signs, appointing custodians, executing and filing
financing or continuation statements in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender, maintaining stock records and transferring of Inventory to warehouses.
If any Inventory is in the possession or control of any third party other than a
purchaser in the ordinary course of business, a processor or a public
warehouseman where the warehouse receipt is in the name of or held by Lender,
Borrowers shall notify such person of Lender's security interest therein, obtain
such party's acknowledgment that it holds the Inventory for Lender's benefit,
and instruct such person or persons to hold all such Inventory for the account
of Lender and subject to Lender's instructions. Schedule 10.4 annexed hereto
sets forth the name and address of all of Borrowers' processors and
warehousemen, however, Inventory in the possession or control of a processor
shall not constitute Eligible Inventory and Inventory in the possession or
control of a warehouseman shall not constitute Eligible Inventory without full
compliance with this Section 10.4 and otherwise at Lender's sole discretion.
Borrowers will deliver to Lender warehouse receipts covering any Inventory
located in warehouses showing Lender as the beneficiary thereof and will also
deliver to the warehouseman such agreements relating to the release of warehouse
Inventory as Lender may request. Upon the request of Lender, a physical
verification of all Inventory wherever located will be taken by Borrowers at
least once during every Contract Year, and as often as otherwise reasonably
required by Lender, and a copy of such physical verification shall be submitted
to Lender. If Lender so requests, Borrowers shall also submit to Lender a copy
of any physical Inventory. From time to time, and at least once every month in
any event, Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Lender, a confirmatory Record,
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, listing Borrowers' Inventory, but
any failure to execute or deliver the same shall not affect or limit Lender's
security interest in and to the Inventory. If Borrowers shall fail to deliver to
Lender any Inventory, financial or any other report with respect to the
Collateral required to be delivered by Borrowers pursuant to Sections 8, 9 and
10 of this Agreement within five (5) days after the dates set forth therein,
then Borrowers agree to pay to Lender a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day,
beginning on the date that next follows the date required for delivery of such
report and continuing through the date that Borrowers deliver said report for
each report that Borrowers fail to deliver to Lender under this Agreement.


         10.5 Maintenance of Inventory Records. Lender may examine and inspect
Borrowers' Inventory, Equipment or other Collateral and may examine, inspect and
copy all books and records with respect thereto at any time during Borrowers'
normal business hours. Borrowers shall maintain full, accurate and complete
records respecting Borrowers' Inventory, including a perpetual inventory, and
all other Collateral at all times. Borrowers will pay all costs to be paid on
taxes, assessments, governmental charges or private encumbrances levied,
assessed, imposed or payable upon or with respect to Borrowers' Inventory,
Equipment or other Collateral or any part thereof.

connection with each Receivable have been performed.

12.      SPECIAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RECEIVABLES AND RELATED
MATTERS.

         12.1 Confirmatory Record of Assignments. Promptly after the creation of
any Receivable, if Lender shall so request, Borrowers shall execute and deliver
confirmatory written assignments to Lender of such Receivable, but the failure
to execute or deliver any schedule or assignment shall not affect or limit any
Lien or other right of Lender in and to any Receivable. Borrowers shall cause
all of its invoices to be printed and to bear consecutive numbers, and to issue
its invoices in such consecutive numerical order. On Lender's request therefor,
Borrowers shall also furnish to Lender copies of invoices to customers and
shipping and delivery receipts or warehouse receipts thereof. Borrowers will
also furnish Lender with such other documents and instruments as Lender may
request in connection with any Receivables, including detailed monthly agings.
Borrowers shall deliver to Lender the originals of all letters of credit, notes,
and instruments in its favor and such endorsements or assignments as Lender may
request.

         12.2 Notice of Certain Events. Borrowers will notify Lender of all
returns and recoveries of merchandise and of all claims asserted with respect to
merchandise which such returns, recoveries or claims exceed $25,000 per
occurrence. Borrowers shall promptly report each such return, repossession or
recovery of merchandise to Lender, advising it of the location thereof and
providing it with a description of such goods and their location. Borrowers
shall not settle or adjust any dispute or claim, or grant any discount (except
ordinary trade discounts), credit or allowance or accept any return of
merchandise, without Lender's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may settle or
adjust disputes or claims directly with customers or Account Debtors of
Borrowers for amounts and upon terms which it considers advisable. Where
Borrowers receive Collateral of any kind or nature by reason of transactions
between itself and its customers or Account Debtors, it will hold the same on
Lender's behalf, subject to Lender's instructions, and as property forming part
of the Receivables. Where a Borrower sells to a customer or Account Debtor which
also sells to it or which may have other claims against it, Borrowers will
promptly advise Lender.

and all books and records of Borrowers at any time. Borrowers authorize Lender
to execute alone any financing statements or other documents or instruments that
Lender may require to perfect, protect or establish any Lien or security
interest granted to Lender by Borrowers and further authorize Lender to sign
Borrowers' name on the same. Borrowers appoint such person or persons as Lender
may designate as Borrowers' attorney-in-fact to endorse the names of Borrowers
on any checks, notes, drafts or other forms of payment or security that may come
into the possession of Lender or any Affiliate of Lender, to sign Borrowers'
name on invoices or bills of lading, drafts against customers, notice of
assignment, verifications and schedules and, generally, to do all things
necessary to carry out this Agreement. Such attorney-in-fact may notify the Post
Office authorities to change the address of delivery of mail to an address
designated by Lender, and open and dispose of mail addressed to Borrowers. The
powers granted herein, being coupled with an interest, are irrevocable, and
Borrowers approve and ratify all acts of the attorney-in-fact. Neither Lender
nor the attorney-in-fact shall be liable for any act or omission, error in
judgment or mistake of law so long as the same is not willful or grossly
negligent.

promise or Obligation to Lender hereunder or under any Loan Document, Lender
may, but shall not be required to, perform, pay, satisfy, discharge or bond the

held by, or any other Indebtedness at any time owing by Lender or any Affiliate
of Lender or any participant in Lender's loans, to Borrowers to or for the

of the matters set forth in Sections 7, 10, 11 and 13, of the representations
set forth in the Loan Documents, and that no Default or Event of Default then
exists. If requested by Lender, Borrower shall further confirm such matters by
delivery of a certificate dated the day of the advancing of such Loan and signed
by an authorized officer of Borrower.

18.       TERM. Unless sooner terminated by Lender pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the period during which the Revolving Loan shall be available
shall initially be a period commencing on the date hereof and concluding on the
Termination Date. Borrower shall give Lender at least ninety (90) days' advance
written notice ("Termination Notice") of Borrower's election to terminate the
availability of Revolving Loans hereunder prior to the Termination Date, which
notice shall be irrevocable and such termination shall be subject Section 3.7
hereof.

19.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

         19.1 Defaults. Upon the happening of any of the following events
(collectively, "Events of Default"):

                    (a) if Borrowers shall fail to make payment when due of any
Obligation under this Agreement or any Loan Document; or

                    (b) if Borrowers shall fail to comply with any terms,
conditions, covenant, warranty or representation contained in Articles 10, 11 or
15 of this Agreement; or

                    (c) if Borrowers shall fail to comply with any term,
condition, covenant or warranty of or in this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any other agreement between Lender and Borrowers, other than in Articles 10,
11 or 15 of this Agreement, and such failure continues for a period in excess of
ten (10) days after notice thereof is given by Lender to Borrowers; or

                    (d) if any of Borrowers shall cease to be Solvent, make an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors, call a meeting of its creditors to
obtain any general financial accommodation, suspend business or if any case
under any provision of the Bankruptcy Code, including provisions for
reorganizations, shall be commenced by or against any of Borrowers; or

                    (e) if any statement or representation contained in any
financial statement or certificate delivered by Borrowers to Lender shall be
false, in any respect, when made; or

                    (f) if any federal tax lien is filed of record against any

or

                                       37

<PAGE>



                    (g) if Borrowers' independent public accountants shall
refuse to deliver any financial statement required by this Agreement; or

                    (h) if a receiver, trustee or equivalent officer shall be
appointed for all or any of the assets of Borrowers; or

                    (i) if a judgment for more than Twenty Five Thousand 00/100
Dollars ($25,000.00) shall be entered against any of Borrowers in any action or
proceeding and shall not be stayed, vacated, bonded, paid, discharged or applied
in good faith within ten (10) days except a judgment where the claim is covered
by insurance and the insurance company has accepted liability therefor; or

                    (j) if any obligation of Borrowers in respect of
Indebtedness in an amount of $10,000.00 or more (other than Indebtedness to
Lender) shall be declared to be or shall become due and payable prior to the
stated maturity thereof or such obligation shall not be paid as and when the
same becomes due and payable; or there shall occur any event or condition which
constitutes an event of default under any mortgage, indenture, instrument,
agreement or evidence of indebtedness relating to any obligation of Borrowers in
respect of any such Indebtedness the effect of which is to permit the holder or
the holders of such mortgage, indenture, instrument, agreement or evidence of
Indebtedness, or a trustee, agent or other representative on behalf of such
holder or holders, to cause the Indebtedness evidenced thereby to become due
prior to its stated maturity; or

                    (k) upon the happening of any Reportable Event which Lender
in its good faith sole discretion determines might constitute grounds for the
termination of any Plan, or if a trustee shall be appointed by an appropriate
United States District Court or other court of administrative tribunal to
administer any Plan, or if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation shall
institute proceedings to terminate any Plan or to appoint a trustee to
administer any Plan; or

                    (l) upon the occurrence and continuance of any Material
Adverse Effect, which in the sole and absolute opinion of Lender, impairs
Lender's security or increases its risks; or

                    (m) if any Validity Guarantor purports to terminate its
validity and support agreement.

then and in any such event, Lender may terminate this Agreement without prior
notice or demand to Borrowers or may demand payment of all Obligations (whether
otherwise then payable on demand or not) without terminating this Agreement and
shall, in any event, be under no further responsibility to extend any credit or
afford any financial accommodation to Borrowers, whether under this Agreement or
otherwise.

<PAGE>



         19.2 Obligations Immediately Due. Upon the effective date of
termination for any reason, all of Borrowers' Obligations to Lender, including
but not limited to the Loans, shall immediately become due and payable without
further notice or demand.

         19.3 Continuation of Security Interests. Notwithstanding any
termination, until all Obligations of Borrowers shall have been fully paid and
satisfied, Lender shall retain all security in and title to all existing and
future Receivables, General Intangibles, Inventory, Equipment, Fixtures,
Investment Property, Deposit Accounts, Letter-of-Credit Rights and other
Collateral held by Lender hereunder or under any other agreement and Borrower
shall continue to assign Receivables and consign Inventory to Lender and
continue to turn over collections to Lender.

20.      REMEDIES OF LENDER.

         20.1 Rights Under Uniform Commercial Code. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default or upon any termination of this Agreement following an Event of
Default, then Lender shall have, in addition to all of its other rights under
this Agreement or otherwise (which rights shall be cumulative), all of the
rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code and
shall have the right to enter upon any premises where the Collateral is kept and
peacefully retake possession thereof. Lender may, without demand, advertising or
notice all of which Borrowers hereby waive (except as the same may be required
by law), sell, lease, dispose of, deliver and grant options to a third party to
purchase, lease or otherwise dispose of any and all Receivables, General
Intangibles, Inventory, Equipment, Fixtures, Investment Property or other
security or Collateral held by it or for its account at any time or times in one
or more public or private sales or other dispositions, for cash, on credit or
otherwise, as such prices and upon such terms as Lender, in its sole discretion,
deems advisable. Notice of any public sale shall be sufficient if it describes
the security or Collateral to be sold in general terms, stating the amounts
thereof, the nature of the business in which such Collateral was created and the
location and nature of the properties covered by the other security interests or
mortgages and the prior liens thereon, and is published at least once in The
Wall Street Journal or The New York Times not less than ten (10) business days
prior to the date of sale. If The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times is
not then being published, publication may be made in lieu thereof in any
newspaper then being circulated in the City of White Plains New York which
Lender may elect. Notice of any public sale shall be sufficient if it describes
the security or Collateral to be sold in general terms, stating the amounts
thereof, the nature of the business in which such Collateral was created and the
location and nature of the properties covered by the other security interests or
mortgages and the prior liens thereon. Without requiring notice to Borrowers,
all requirements of reasonable notice under this Article shall be met if such
notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Borrowers at the address set forth above
or such other address as Borrowers may have provided to Lender, in a Record, at
least ten (10) days before the time of such sale or disposition. Lender may, if
it deems it reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of any Collateral from time
to time by an announcement at the time and place of the sale to be so postponed
or adjourned without being required to give a new notice of sale, provided,
however, that Lender shall provide Borrowers with written notice of the time and
place of such postponed or adjourned sale. Lender


                                       39

<PAGE>



may be the purchaser at any such sale if it is public, and payment may be made,
in whole or in part, in respect of such purchase price by the application of
Obligations due from Borrowers to Lender. Borrowers shall be obligated for, and
the proceeds of sale shall be applied first to, the costs of retaking,
refurbishing, storing, guarding, insuring, preparing for sale, and selling the
Collateral, including the fees and disbursements of attorneys, auctioneers,
appraisers and accountants employed by Lender. Proceeds shall then be applied to
the payment in whatever order Lender may elect, of all Obligations of Borrowers.
Lender shall return any excess to Borrowers and Borrowers shall remain liable
for any deficiency. Collateral securing purchase money security interests also
secures non-purchase money security interests. To the extent Debtor uses an
Advance to purchase Collateral, Debtor's repayment of the Advance shall apply on
a "first-in-first-out" basis so that the portion of the Advance used to purchase
a particular item of Collateral shall be paid in the chronological order the
Debtor purchased the Collateral.

         20.2 Collections; Modification of Terms. Without limiting any rights
Lender may have pursuant to Section 20.1 above, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may demand, sue for, collect and
give receipts for any money, instruments or property payable or receivable on
account of or in exchange for any of the Collateral, or make any compromises it
deems necessary or proper, including without limitation, extending the time of
payment, permitting payment in installments, or otherwise modifying the terms or
rights relating to any of the Collateral, all of which may be effected without
notice to or consent by Borrower and without otherwise discharging or affecting
the Obligations, the Collateral or the security interest granted under this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents.

         20.3 Notification of Account Debtors. Without limiting any rights of
Lender pursuant to this Agreement or under applicable law, after a Default or
Event of Default has occurred, (i) Borrowers, at the request of Lender, shall
notify the Account Debtors of Lender's security interest in Borrowers'
Receivables; and (ii) Lender may notify the Account Debtors on any of the
Receivables to make payment directly to Lender, and Lender may endorse all items
of payment received by it that are payable to Borrowers.

         20.4 Insurance. Without limiting any rights of Lender pursuant to this
Agreement or under applicable law, after a Default or Event of Default has
occurred, Lender may file proofs of loss and claim with respect to any of the
Collateral with the appropriate insurer, and may endorse in its own and
Borrowers' name any checks or drafts constituting insurance proceeds.

         20.5 Waiver of Rights by Borrowers. Except as may be otherwise
specifically provided herein or in any other agreement between Lender and
Borrowers which may be applicable, Borrowers waive, to the extent permitted by
law, any bonds, security or sureties required by any statute, rule or otherwise
by law as an incident to any taking of possession by Lender of property subject
to Lender's Lien. Borrowers authorize Lender, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, to enter upon any premises owned by or leased to any of Borrowers
without obligation to pay rent or for use and occupancy, through self help,
without judicial process and without having first given notice to Borrowers or
obtained an order of any court.

<PAGE>



         20.6 Lender's Rights. Borrowers agree that Lender shall not have any
obligation to preserve rights to any Collateral against prior parties or to
marshall any Collateral of any kind for the benefit of any other creditor of
Borrowers or any other person. After the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Lender is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without charge,
Borrowers' labels, patents, copyrights, rights of use of any name, trade
secrets, trade names, trademarks and advertising matter, or any property of a
similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of,
advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and Borrowers' rights under all
licenses and any franchise, sales or distribution agreements shall inure to
Lender's benefit for such purpose.

         20.7 Compliance With Other Laws. Lender may comply with any applicable
law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral, and
compliance will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial
reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

         20.8 Warranties. Lender may sell the Collateral without giving any
warranties. Lender may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the
like. This procedure will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial
reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

         20.9 Sales on Credit. If Lender sells any of the Collateral on credit,
Borrowers will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser,
received by Lender and applied to the Indebtedness. If the purchaser fails to
pay for the Collateral, Lender may resell the Collateral, and Borrowers shall be
credited for the proceeds of the sale.

21.      GENERAL PROVISIONS.

         21.1 Rights Cumulative. Lender's rights and remedies under this
Agreement shall be cumulative and non-exclusive of any other rights or remedies
which it may have under any other agreement or instrument, by operation of law
or otherwise.

         21.2 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is entered into for the
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns. It shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the, benefit of the said parties, their
successors and assigns. Lender shall have the right, without the necessity of
any further consent or authorization by Borrowers, to sell, assign, securitize
or grant participation in all, or a portion of, Lender's interest in the Loans,
to other financial institutions of the Lender's choice and on such terms as are
acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion.

         21.3 Notice. Wherever this Agreement provides for notice to any party
(except as expressly provided to the contrary), it shall be given by messenger,
facsimile, certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or nationally
recognized overnight courier with receipt requested, effective when received by
the corporate party to whom addressed, and shall be addressed as follows, or to

         21.4 Strict Performance. The failure, at any time or times hereafter,
to require strict performance by Borrowers of any provision of this Agreement
shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of Lender thereafter to demand
strict compliance and performance therewith. Any suspension or waiver by Lender
of any Event of Default by Borrowers under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents shall not suspend, waive or affect any other Event of Default by
Borrowers under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, whether the

         21.6 Waiver. Borrowers waive presentment, protest, notice of dishonor
and notice of protest upon any instrument on which it may be liable to Lender as

         21.7 Conflict of Laws. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York;
provided, however, that if any of the Collateral shall be located in any
jurisdiction other than New York, the laws of such jurisdiction shall govern the
method, manner and procedure for foreclosure of Lenders' lien upon such
Collateral and the enforcement of Lenders' other remedies in respect of such
Collateral to the extent that the laws of such jurisdiction are different from
or inconsistent with the laws of New York.

         21.8 Expenses. If, at any time or times prior or subsequent to the date
hereof, regardless of whether or not an Event of Default then exists or any of
the transactions contemplated hereunder are concluded, Lender employs counsel
for advice or other representation, or incurs legal expenses or other costs or

Collateral; (F) any attempt to enforce any rights or remedies of Lender against
Borrowers or any other Person which may be obligated to Lender by virtue of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the
Account Debtors; or (G) any attempt to inspect, verify, protect, preserve,
restore, collect, sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the
Collateral; then, in any such event, the actual attorneys' fees and expenses
arising from such services and all expenses, costs, charges and other fees of
such counsel of Lender or relating to any of the events or actions described in
this Section shall be payable by Borrowers to Lender, and shall be additional

harmless from and against liability in connection therewith. Borrowers shall

         21.9 Reimbursements Charged to Revolving Loan. With respect to any
amount advanced by Lender and required to be reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to
the foregoing provisions of Section 21.8, it is hereby agreed that Lender may
charge any such amount to Borrowers' Revolving Loan on the dates such
reimbursement is made. Borrowers' obligations under Section 21.8 shall survive
termination of the other provisions of this Agreement.

         21.10 Waiver of Right to Jury Trial. Borrowers waive the right to trial
by jury in the event of any action, suit, proceeding, counterclaim or other
litigation to which Lender and any of Borrowers are party in respect of any
matter arising under this Agreement or any other matter involving any of

such other individual or entity in connection with:

                    (a) any investigation, action or proceeding arising out of
or in any way relating to this Agreement, any of the Loans, any of the Loan
Documents, any other agreement relating to any of the Obligations, any of the

                    (b) any taxes, liabilities, claims or damages relating to
the Collateral or Lender's liens thereon; or

                    (c) the correctness, validity of genuineness of any

(which shall automatically be deemed to be without recourse to Lender in any
event), or the existence, character, quantity, quality, condition, value or
delivery of any goods purporting to be represented by any such documents;

                    (d) any broker's commission, finder's fee or similar charge
or fee in connection with the Loans and the transactions contemplated in this

                    (e) any amounts paid by Lender to Finova Capital Corporation
in connection with that certain Indemnification Agreement dated on or about the

satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all matters
referred to under Section 22.1.

         22.3 Waiver. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no claim may be

for breach of contract, tort or any other theory of liability arising out of or
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any act, omission
or event occurring in connection therewith; and Borrowers hereby waive, release
and agree not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued
and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. Neither Lender nor
any of its Affiliates, partners, officers, employees or agents shall be liable

of notice or the passage of time, or both, conflict with, result in a default,

or severance pay, or any other obligation to Seller's existing employees,

agree that any accrued vacation time owing to existing employees shall not be an
obligation transferred to Buyer for such employees if and when they are hired by
Buyer. Prior to closing Seller shall bring current its obligations to its
employees, including its obligations, if any, for wages, vacation time or any
withholding obligations owed to governmental agencies or other third parties by

parties to this Contract concerning the rights and duties of either party in
relation to the business or this Contract, the prevailing party in the
litigation shall be entitled to (in addition to any other relief that may be

contemplated by this Contract shall be resolved in an action filed in a court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of New Jersey.
