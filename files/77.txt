     This amendment to the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2004 (this "Form 10-K/A") of Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") is being
filed solely to include the information required by Part III of Form 10-K
pursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K because the Company's
definitive proxy statement for its 2005 annual meeting of shareholders to be
held on June 23, 2005 (the "Proxy Statement") will be filed more than 120 days
after the end of the Company's fiscal year. The Company currently expects to
file the Proxy Statement on or about May 20, 2005. The original Form 10-K is
also amended hereby to delete the reference on the cover page thereof to the
incorporation by reference of the Proxy Statement in Part III of such report.
Except as set forth in the remainder of this Explanatory Note, no other
information in the original filing is amended hereby, and this Form 10-K/A does
not otherwise reflect events occurring after the original filing date of March
31, 2005.

     The Company has determined that it was not in compliance at December 31,
2004 and 2003 with certain debt covenants related to its 8 5/8% Senior Notes due
2011(the "Senior Notes") relating to the timely payments of liquidated damages
due to its Senior Note holders and timely filing of certain certificates
required in the covenants to the Senior Notes at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The
Company has subsequently cured the defaults relating to the liquidated damages
and certain of the certificates and intends to cure the remaining certificate
defaults concurrent with the filing of the 10-K/A discussed below.

     In addition, certain defaults under the Senior Notes were also defaults
under certain covenants under the Company's Senior Credit Facility ("Senior
Credit Facility"). However, since these triggering defaults under the Senior
Notes have now been cured, and the Company has notified the Bank Administrative
Agent of the existence and subsequent cure of such defaults, these defaults
under the Senior Credit Facility have been cured and such facility is not
currently callable.

     In addition, in connection with its April 2005 review of debt covenants,
the Company discovered that it had not made a timely filing of its December 31,
2003 compliance certificate with the trustee for the 3.0% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2006 ("06 Notes"). The Company has filed the required
certificate with the trustee for the 06 Notes and therefore has cured this
default.

     As a result of these defaults, the Company intends to file, during the week
of May 2, 2005, a further Form 10-K/A (to amend Item 1 of Part I; Items 6, 7, 8,
and 9 of Part II; Part IV and such other Items as may be necessary) for the year
ended December 31, 2004 and amend its reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters
ended September 30, 2003 and March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 to, among
other things, update disclosures related to internal controls and compliance
with debt covenants and to revise the financial statements included therein to
reclassify certain debt as current on the Company's consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2003 and 2004 and at September 30, 2003 and March 31, June 30
and September 30, 2004 ($503,293,000 at December 31, 2004 and other amounts at
each of the other balance sheet dates). The Company expects that beginning with
the filing of the Form 10Q for the period ending March 31, 2005, the balance
sheet classification of the debt will reflect these debt instruments as
long-term based on the curing of the defaults described above.

     The Company has concluded that an additional material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2004 because it did
not maintain effective controls to ensure the appropriate review and monitoring
of compliance with certain of its debt covenants. While the Company has a
detailed quarterly process for reviewing its compliance with its Senior Credit
Facility covenants (the Senior Credit Facility contains the most restrictive
covenants and unlike the Senior Notes imposes "maintenance" covenants), a
comparable process did not exist as of December 31, 2004 for the Senior Notes
and the 06 Notes. This control deficiency resulted in the Company failing to
comply with certain of its debt covenants. As a result of this control
deficiency the Company will be restating its financial statements to reclassify
certain debt as current on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 2003 and 2004 and at September 30, 2003 and March 31, June 30 and September
30, 2004 and to amend its disclosures related to debt covenant compliance. This
control deficiency could result in a misstatement of debt and the related
disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or
interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Because of
the existence of other material weaknesses, the Company's management had
previously concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

(1) Includes those persons who, in fiscal year 2004, were the Chief Executive
    Officer or one of the four most highly compensated executive officers, as
    measured by salary and bonus. Dr. Warner served as Senior Vice President,
    Compliance and Human Pharmaceuticals Scientific Affairs during 2004 and
    assumed his current position in January 2005.

(2) The Company follows a bi-weekly payroll schedule, which results in one
    additional payroll period every seven years. 2003 was the year in which the
    Company paid an additional payroll amount, which accounts for the larger
    salary amounts in 2003 versus 2004 for Ms. Wiik and Messrs. Farrell and
    Wrobel. Dr. Warner and Ms. Wrenn received salary increases applicable to
    2004, whereas Ms. Wiik's and Messrs. Farrell's and Wrobel's 2004 salaries
    remained at 2003 levels. A portion of Ms. Wiik's salary and benefits is paid
    to her in Norway. Furthermore, a modest amount of Ms. Wiik's compensation is
    nondeductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
    Code, as amended.

(3) Dr. Warner's bonus includes a $75,000 bonus he was granted in his employment
    agreement for completion of 18 months of employment (See "Employment
    Agreements" below).

(4) Dr. Warner's 2003 "Other Annual Compensation" amount reflects his 2003
    Executive Allowance in the amount of $28,600 and the value of re-location
    benefits he received from the Company in 2003 in the amount of approximately
    $32,000.

(5) Reflects the dollar value on the date of grant of restricted stock issued
    under the Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. On December

SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL PLANS

     Ms. Wiik, Mr. Farrell, Dr. Warner, Ms. Wrenn and Mr. Wrobel receive
additional benefits pursuant to the Company's Severance Plan and Change in
Control Plan, both of which were adopted by the Board of Directors in 2002 and
amended in February and April 2004 (the "Severance Plan" and "Change In Control
Plan", respectively).

     Pursuant to the terms of the Severance Plan, in the event Ms. Wiik is
terminated for any reason other than for cause, she is entitled to receive her
base salary, bonus and certain benefits for twenty-four months, subject to
certain tax limitations. Pursuant to the Change in Control Plan, if Ms. Wiik is
terminated as a result of a change in control of the Company, she is entitled to
receive her salary and certain benefits for a total of thirty-six months,
subject to certain tax limitations, and her outstanding stock options shall
immediately vest. Furthermore, pursuant to the Change in Control Plan, upon
certain conditions following a "change in control", Ms. Wiik's outstanding
shares of Restricted Stock and Performance Units, granted pursuant to the
Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, shall also immediately vest.

     Additionally, the Severance Plan provides that in the event that an
executive officer, including Mr. Farrell, Dr. Warner, Ms. Wrenn or Mr. Wrobel,
is terminated for any reason other than for cause, such executive officer is
entitled to receive his or her base salary, bonus and certain benefits for
eighteen months, subject to certain tax limitations. The Change in Control Plan
provides that if such an executive officer is terminated as a result of a change
in control of the Company, such executive officer is entitled to receive his or
her base salary and certain benefits for a total of thirty months, subject to
certain tax limitations, and his or her outstanding stock options shall
immediately vest. Furthermore, pursuant to the Change in Control Plan, upon
certain conditions following a "change in control", such executive officer's
outstanding shares of Restricted Stock and Performance Units, granted pursuant
to the Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, shall also
immediately vest.

     The Severance Plan also provides for payments to be made to certain other
key employees of the Company in the event of termination for any reason other
than for cause or as a result of a change in control of the Company. The Change
in Control Plan provides for payments to be made to such key employees upon a
change in control of the Company, in addition to the potential acceleration of
vesting of certain stock options, shares of Restricted Stock and Performance
Units granted pursuant to the Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation
Plan.

PERFORMANCE CASH BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has approved
the performance goals underlying the Company's Executive Bonus Plan that shall
apply to the 2005 fiscal year. The Executive Bonus Plan provides that all
executive officers (other than Ms. Wiik) and key employees performing services
for the Company may be entitled to receive a cash bonus at a target level. Each
of the named executive officers may receive more or less than his or her target
level bonus, based upon the Company's ability to achieve certain net income and
cash flow targets for 2005. In addition, for executive officers who are
responsible for a specific business segment of the Company, a portion of his or
her bonus will depend on such business segment's achievement of certain income
and cash flow targets for 2005. As provided in the Executive Bonus Plan, the
Compensation Committee has the discretion to vary any individual bonus award
from the amount derived by the application of the criteria described above. Ms.
Wiik does not participate in the Executive Bonus Plan, but she is entitled to
receive an annual cash bonus at a target level based on the Company's overall
performance and her achievement of individual objectives as set forth in her
employment agreement. (See "Employment Agreements" for further information.) Ms.
Wiik will have a target bonus for 2005 of 100% of base salary, and Mr. Farrell,
Dr. Warner, Ms. Wrenn and Mr. Wrobel will have target bonuses for 2005 of 50% of
base salary.

(1) Each named executive officer has been granted a Performance Unit Award,
    consisting of the number of Performance Units shown. Performance Units
    become 100% vested on the last day of the three-year performance period, at
    which time their value is determined based upon total shareholder return
    (TSR) of the Company as compared to competitor companies over the three-year
    performance period, and the Company's achievement of a minimum free cash
    flow target. Competitor companies are those small-cap and mid-cap companies
    included in the Dow Jones U.S. Pharmaceuticals Index.

(2) In the event of the retirement, disability or death of a named executive
    officer, awards of Performance Units shall be prorated up to the date of
    retirement, disability or death and paid at the end of the performance
    period.

(3) "Threshold" amounts shown assume the Company's TSR as compared to its
    competitors ranks between the 50th and 59th percentiles. However, the value
    of Performance Units could be $0, if the Company's TSR relative to its
    competitors falls below the 50th percentile. "Target" amounts shown assume
    the Company's TSR relative to its competitors ranks between the 60th and
    74th percentiles, and "Maximum" amounts may be achieved above the 90th
    percentile. (Between the 75th and 89th percentiles, payouts will be $150 per
    Performance Unit.) If the Company had computed its TSR as of December 31,
    2004, the value of all Performance Units would have been $0.

RETIREMENT PLANS

     Ms. Wiik is not a participant in the Company's Pension Plan (as defined
below) pursuant to the terms of her employment agreement. (See "Employment
Agreements" for further information.) Upon Ms. Wiik's retirement as President
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (which she has informed the Company
shall be on or about December 31, 2005, consistent with the election of her
successor), she is entitled to receive from the Company an annual retirement
benefit for each calendar year following retirement equal to (i) 30% of her Base
Compensation (defined below) plus (ii) inflationary adjustments (which shall be
the same as the adjustment for inflation provided in the retirement plan for
Alpharma AS for Norwegian employees) minus (iii) "Other Retirement Benefits"
(defined below). "Base Compensation" means her annual base salary during the
twelve month period ending on the last day of the month preceding retirement or
disability (provided that, if base salary shall have changed during such twelve
month period, Base Compensation shall mean the average annual base salary
weighted to reflect the number of days during which each varying base salary was
in effect). "Other Retirement Benefits" means amounts Ms. Wiik is entitled to
receive as retirement benefits under Norwegian pension plans, but does not
include (i) payments received under the Company Savings Plans or the deferred
compensation plan maintained by the Company, or (ii) retirement benefits
received under any governmental program or under any insurance program funded by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their predecessors. All amounts not
payable in Norwegian Kroner shall be subject to a fixed currency conversion rate
of one United States dollar equal to NOK 9.60. (As compared to the March 31,
2005 exchange rate of approximately NOK 6.34 per 1 USD.)

     Mr. Farrell, Dr. Warner, Ms. Wrenn and Mr. Wrobel are participants in the
Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan (a qualified defined benefit plan) (the "Pension
Plan"). Under the Pension Plan, both salaried and hourly employees are eligible
for benefits. Participants who have at least five years of vested service with
the

                                        10
<PAGE>

Company are entitled to receive their specified annual benefit, in the form of a
life annuity or, at the election of participants, its actuarial equivalent in
certain other forms, commencing within one month of their 65th birthday. The
specified annual benefit is equal to (x) the sum of (i) 0.8% of the
participant's highest five-year Final Average Compensation (as defined below) up
to "covered compensation" ($41,000 for 2004) plus (ii) 1.45% of the
participant's highest five-year Final Average Compensation in excess of "covered
compensation", multiplied by (y) the number of years of benefit service (up to a
maximum of 30 years). The Pension Plan also provides for an early retirement
benefit which is equal to the specified annual benefit described above, reduced
actuarially for each year by which the early retirement date precedes the normal
retirement date. Participants are eligible for early retirement upon attainment
of age 55 and completion of at least five years of vested service with the
Company.

     The following table sets forth the approximate annual retirement benefit
under the Pension Plan based on years of service and Final Average Compensation.

(1) Final average compensation. Current Federal pension law limits average
    annual compensation considered for benefit purposes to $205,000 for 2004.

(2) The Plan provides that there is a maximum of 30 years of service for
    computation of benefits.

     For purposes of the Pension Plan, an employee's "Final Average
Compensation" generally is his or her regular cash salary (excluding bonuses)
for the five consecutive years of service in which his or her compensation was
highest during the ten years of service immediately preceding his or her
retirement. In 2004, the amounts of the compensation of Mr. Farrell, Dr. Warner,
Ms. Wrenn and Mr. Wrobel would have been $407,732 $319,231, $357,500, and
$398,618, respectively, under the Pension Plan if there were no limitations
under Federal pension law. However, due to the Federal pension law, the
respective amounts of compensation of Mr. Farrell, Dr. Warner, Ms. Wrenn and Mr.
Wrobel, under the Pension Plan in 2004 were limited to $205,000. Pursuant to the
Company's Supplemental Pension Plan, Mr. Farrell, Dr. Warner, Ms. Wrenn and Mr.
Wrobel are each entitled to receive a supplemental benefit, calculated above
such $205,000 Federal limit, based upon a maximum base compensation of $235,000
per annum. The years of service credited under the Pension Plan as of December
31, 2004 to the named executive officers were as follows: Mr. Farrell -- 3
years, Dr. Warner -- 2 years, Ms. Wrenn -- 3 years and Mr. Wrobel -- 7 years.

     Under the Pension Plan, in the event of the termination of employment prior
to retirement, part of the employee's benefit may be forfeited. A retirement
benefit, payable in the form of a life annuity following the

                                        11
<PAGE>

employee's 55th birthday, is equal to an accrued percentage of the normal
retirement benefit, actuarially reduced to reflect commencement of payments
prior to the normal retirement date. As to employees hired on or after January
1, 1989, pension benefits under the Pension Plan vest after five years of
credited service with the Company.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has
consisted of Mr. William I. Jacobs, Ms. Jill Kanin-Lovers, Mr. Peter G. Tombros
and Ms. Farah M. Walters since May 2004. Mr. Tombros served as Chairman through
May 2004, at which point Ms. Kanin-Lovers assumed the role of Chairman.

     Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee is responsible for
reviewing the performance and total compensation of the Company's Chief
Executive Officer (the "CEO"), reviewing and approving the compensation and
benefits of other executive officers and highly paid personnel, reviewing the
general compensation and employment policies for management personnel, reviewing
management development and succession matters, and approving any material new
benefit plan or material amendment to such plan.

     In general, the Compensation Committee has sought to meet the objectives of
its compensation philosophy by making compensation decisions and recommendations
for executive officers and other key personnel in a manner which: (1) provides
overall compensation that is competitive in its ability to attract and retain
highly qualified personnel; (2) relates compensation to the degree to which the
Company (and/or the specific business unit in which an executive has
responsibility) attains its annual financial performance targets; (3) rewards
excellent individual performance and teamwork, with consideration for specific
projects completed or adverse conditions overcome to achieve results; and (4)
provides an incentive to contribute to the long-term growth of the Company's
businesses and stockholder value. In making compensation recommendations, the
Committee is mindful of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and consults with tax advisors as necessary to minimize any
nondeductible compensation under Section 162(m).

     During 2004, the Compensation Committee: (1) initiated a process to plan
for CEO succession; (2) developed and approved a competency model identifying
the leadership attributes required to take the Company forward; (3) monitored
ongoing efforts to address various employment and benefits related issues; (4)
took action to address retention concerns; (5) approved modifications to the
Board of Directors compensation program to align with competitive practice; (6)
approved amendments to clarify the Change in Control Plan and Severance Plan;
(7) approved compensation arrangements for various new executives; and (8)
continued efforts to implement a new compensation philosophy that places more
emphasis on Company results and individual performance and decreases reliance on
salary and other fixed elements of pay.

     In March 2004, the Compensation Committee set various company-wide and
divisional targets for income from operations and cash flow from operations for
2004 under the Company's Executive Bonus Plan (applicable to employees at the
Vice President level and above other than Ms. Wiik) and Performance Incentive
Plan (applicable to employees below the Vice President level). (See "Performance
Cash Bonus Incentive Plan" for a discussion of Ms. Wiik's annual cash bonus
award.) In addition, target awards for 2004 were established for each named
executive officer (100% of base salary for Ms. Wiik and 50% of base salary for
all other named executive officers).

     Also in March 2004, the CEO received awards under the 2003 Omnibus
Incentive Compensation Plan, consisting of 75,000 stock options, 45,000 shares
of restricted stock, and 10,000 performance units. The options have an exercise
price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of
grant, vest over four years and have a term of ten years (with the same vesting
schedule and term in the event of retirement). The shares of restricted stock
vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant (and shall vest immediately
upon Ms. Wiik's retirement, death or disability). The performance units have a
face value of $100 per unit at target performance, as measured by relative total
stockholder return over a three year performance period (with any payout
pro-rated for the portion of the performance period employed, in the event of
Ms. Wiik's death, disability or retirement), and the achievement of a minimum
free cash flow target.

<PAGE>

     In February and March 2005, the Compensation Committee reviewed the CEO's
performance during 2004 and recommended several compensation actions with
respect to Ms. Wiik. The Committee's review of Ms. Wiik's performance in 2004
focused on Company financial and operating performance, strategic planning,
internal and external leadership, management succession, and her relationship
with the Board of Directors and stockholders. The Committee discussed the
significant developments affecting the Company, the strategic value of
restructuring the Company, increased cash flow and debt repayment under the
deleveraging initiative, and the CEO's energy and work ethic. In recommending
compensation for the CEO, the Committee was guided by her employment contract
and the performance matters discussed by the Committee, as well as the Company's
overall compensation philosophy and competitive data provided by an independent
consultant. The Committee determined in March 2005 that Ms. Wiik's base salary
for 2005 shall remain at the 2004 level, and it approved a bonus to Ms. Wiik for
2004 that was approximately 39% of her target for 2004, reflects the Committee's
assessment of overall achievement of the Company's and the CEO's objectives, and
is consistent with bonuses received by Alpharma corporate executives generally.

     The Committee also approved, in March 2005, the annual base salaries for
2005 for the named executive officers (other than Ms. Wiik), based on the
compensation philosophy discussed above. Each of the named executive officers
shall receive the same salary in 2005 as in 2004 with the exception of Dr.
Warner, whose base salary effective January 2005 shall be $400,000, as a result
of the increased responsibilities he assumed with his new position.

     In April 2005, Ms. Wiik informed the Committee that, consistent with the
terms of her employment agreement (see "Employment Agreements"), it was her
desire to retire as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company
(but not as Vice Chairman and a member of the Company's Board of Directors),
effective on or about December 31, 2005. The Committee and Ms. Wiik agreed that
the exact date of her retirement, and all other related terms and conditions,
would be subject to further discussions and the timing of the election of her
successor.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

     Mr. Sissener is Chairman of the Board of A. L. Industrier ASA, commonly
known as A. L. Industrier. Together with certain family-controlled private
holding companies and certain of his relatives, Mr. Sissener beneficially owns
approximately 52% of A. L. Industrier's outstanding ordinary shares entitled to
vote and, accordingly, may be deemed a controlling person of A. L. Industrier.

     A. L. Industrier and Alpharma AS, one of the Company's Norwegian
subsidiaries, are parties to two leases pursuant to which A. L. Industrier
leases to Alpharma AS the land and facility in Oslo, Norway where Alpharma AS'
principal administrative offices and fermentation plant for its bulk antibiotics
are located, and adjoining land for a parking facility for employees. Both
leases have terms ending in 2014. The terms are renewable, at the option of
Alpharma AS, for up to four additional consecutive five year terms. Basic rent
during the initial terms are $1.00 per year under the office and plant lease and
NOK 2,400,000 (approximately $379,000) per year under the parking facility lease
and, during any renewal term thereafter, basic rent under the office and plant
lease will be the then prevailing fair rental value of the premises and basic
rent for the parking facility will remain at NOK 2,400,000. In addition to basic
rent, Alpharma AS pays documented expenses of ownership and operation of such
facilities, such as taxes and maintenance expenses. Alpharma AS has the right to
terminate the office and plant lease at any time during its term upon twelve
months' written notice to A. L. Industrier and the parking facility lease at any
time during its term upon twenty-four months' written notice to A. L.
Industrier. These leases were entered into on an arm's length basis, and on
terms as favorable as could have been obtained from unrelated third parties.

     During 2004, Alpharma AS was a party to an administrative services
agreement with A. L. Industrier, dated January 1, 2004, pursuant to which
Alpharma AS provided certain administrative services to A. L. Industrier, at a
fixed yearly fee of NOK 1,000,000, or approximately $158,000. This agreement was
superseded by a new administrative services agreement, effective as of January
1, 2005. Under this new agreement, A. L. Industrier shall pay Alpharma AS a
fixed yearly fee of NOK 400,000, or approximately $63,000, for certain, limited,
administrative services. Both of the administrative service agreements described
above were made on an arm's length basis, and were/are on terms as favorable as
could have been obtained from unrelated third parties.

     All transactions with A. L. Industrier are subject to review by, and in
some circumstances prior approval of, the Company's Audit and Corporate
Governance Committee. (See "Board of Directors and Committees -- Committees of
the Board" above.)

CERTAIN OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS

     Mr. Einar W. Sissener, who as of June 30, 1999, ceased acting as President
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is party to an agreement with the
Company, effective July 1, 1999, as amended March 23, 2004, pursuant to which he
receives an annual fee of $200,000 for serving as Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Company (and director of certain of the Company's
subsidiaries). Mr. Sissener receives fringe benefits substantially equal to
those received by executive officers of the Company, in the form of automobile
allowances, telephone and travel reimbursements, and tax and financial planning
and tax preparation reimbursements. In addition, the Company provides Mr.
Sissener with a monthly allowance intended to cover the cost of certain living
expenses he incurs while working out of the Company's Fort Lee, New Jersey
offices. Mr. Sissener has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company's
management for a ten year term for an initial rate of $12,000 per month (in
addition to the payment of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
performance of such consulting services, as described above). The consulting fee
rate is adjusted annually for inflation and is currently $12,390 per month. In
addition to the amounts described above, Mr. Sissener is entitled to all
benefits available under applicable plans and policies in Norway arising from
retirement from employment by Alpharma AS and is entitled to receive from
Alpharma AS an amount which, when added to amounts he is entitled to receive
under Norwegian Social Security, Alpharma AS's pension plan and his individual
retirement benefits, equals NOK 900,000 (approximately $142,000). The current
annual retirement benefit that Mr. Sissener is receiving directly from the
Company is NOK 423,312 (approximately $67,000).

     4. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
registrant and we have:

          (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
     disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
     ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
     consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
     entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
     prepared;

          (b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
     such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
     supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
     financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
     external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles;

          (c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
     controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
     the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
     of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

          (d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
     control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
     recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case
     of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
     to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
     reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based
on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):

          (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
     or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
     reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
     process, summarize and report financial information; and

          (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
     other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
     control over financial reporting.
