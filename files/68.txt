&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals.  The Company offers a comprehensive range of generic human pharmaceutical products in over 800 tablet, capsule, liquid and topical formulations and dosage forms.  In addition, the Company manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients ("APIs") that are used primarily by third parties in the manufacturing of generic and branded pharmaceutical products.  It also manufactures and markets animal health products in over 100 formulations and dosage forms.  <A NAME="_DV_M28"></A>The Company conducts business in more than 60 countries and has approximately 4,700 employees at 40 sites in 25 countries.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company generated revenue of approximately $1,297.3 million.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M29"></A>Formation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M30"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is incorporated in Delaware.  The Company was originally organized as A.L. Laboratories, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S., a Norwegian healthcare company (the predecessor company to A.L. Industrier ASA).  In 1994, the Company acquired the complementary human pharmaceutical and animal health business of its parent company and subsequently changed its name to Alpharma Inc. to operate worldwide as one corporate entity</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.   </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M31"></A>Controlling Stockholder</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M32"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier") beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock, or approximately 23% of the Company's total common stock outstanding at December 31, 2003.  The Class B common stock currently bears the right to elect more than a majority of the Company's Board of Directors and to cast a majority of the votes in any vote of the Company's stockholders.  Mr. Einar W. Sissener, Chairman of the Board of the Company and a controlling stockholder of Industrier, and members of his immediate family, also beneficially own 373,667 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.  As a result of the ownership of the Class B shares, Industrier, and ultimately Mr. Sissener, can control the Company. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M33"></A>Financing Structures</P>
</B><P><A NAME="_DV_M34"></A>The Company has in place the following debt facilities:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P><A NAME="_DV_M35"></A>(i)&#9;Senior Credit Facility (the "2001 Credit Facility")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpharma Operating Corporation ("Alpharma Operating Corporation"), and certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement ("2001 Credit Facility") with the Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions that provides up to a maximum of $900,000 of senior credit facilities. The 2001 Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  The agreement replaced the prior revolving credit facility, provided the funds required for the Faulding Acquisition (as defined below) and related financing costs and increased overall credit availability. The 1999 revolving credit facility was repaid on October 5, 2001 by drawing down on the 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At closing, the 2001 Credit Facility provided for (i) a $300,000 six year revolving credit facility; (ii) a $175,000 six year Term Loan A; and (iii) a $425,000 seven year Term Loan B.  In December 2001 the Company prepaid $65,000 of the Term A and Term B loans resulting in the maximum amount available to be borrowed under the 2001 Credit Facility being reduced to $835,000.  In 2003 and 2002, the Company prepaid an additional $35,000 and $85,000, respectively of the Term A and Term B loans and recorded an expense for the early extinguishment of debt of $692 and $1,791 (classified in other, net).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2002, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to reduce the revolving credit facility to $150,000. As a result of the modification to the revolving debt arrangement, the Company recognized the related portion of unamortized costs in the statement of income in the amount of $3,176 (classified in other, net). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility has several financial covenants including a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio, senior debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.  In December 2003, an amendment was approved which allowed for specified asset sales, permitted exclusions of restructuring and refinancing charges from EBITDA of up to $10,000 and the required net worth definitions and amended and relaxed leverage ratios (see Note 3).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the 2001 Credit Facility the Company is required to have a specified percentage of its indebtedness at a fixed interest rate. To comply with this requirement, in January 2002 the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap in order to fix the interest rate on $60,000 of its variable rate borrowings under the 2001 credit facility. As a result of an additional reduction in fixed rate indebtedness due to the exchanges of subordinated debt in March 2002 (discussed below), the Company settled this interest rate swap and entered into a standard interest rate swap to effectively fix the interest rate on $100,000 of its variable rate borrowings at a fixed rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2002. The Company reviews and renews its swap requirements on a quarterly basis. The Company accounts for this swap as a cash flow hedge. Unrealized losses of approximately $1,954, net of related tax benefits, are included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Stockho
lders' Equity as a component of comprehensive income (loss).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial covenants, the 2001 Credit Agreement has a number of non-financial covenants. These non-financial covenants include a requirement that control over the Company not be transferred from an entity controlled by E.W. Sissener, the Chairman of the Company, or his family, if as a result or at anytime after such transfer a third party holds shares representing 20% or more of the voting rights in the Company.  Industrier, an entity controlled by Mr. Sissener and his family (and a holding company whose only material business is holding shares of the Company), currently controls the Company by beneficial ownership of all of the Company's Class B shares which carries the right to elect a majority of the Company's directors. The continuation of Industrier's control of the Company remains subject to the unilateral actions of Industrier.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2003, in connection with the offering of the 8 5/8% Senior Notes, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility to exclude from the definition of EBITDA costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 8 5/8% Notes, including the placement fee, to permit the 8 5/8% Notes to be an unsecured senior debt obligation of the Company and to change the senior debt to EBITDA covenant to a senior secured debt to EBITDA covenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2003, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to allow for certain actions associated with the Company's ability to achieve increased financial flexibility. The amendment includes provisions enabling the Company to sell certain assets, provides for additional flexibility in the timing and application of certain financial ratio tests, and permits exclusions of certain restructuring charges and gains and losses on potential divestitures of assets and businesses from the calculation of EBITDA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility's Term A is payable in quarterly installments ranging from $5,136 to $5,992 through 2007.  The Term B is payable in quarterly installments of $729 with balloon payment of $271,915 in 2008.  In the event that more than $10,000 of either the 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 or the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 are outstanding within six months of their due date, the entire remaining balance of the Term A, Term B and the Revolving Credit becomes due and payable.</P>

 (ii)</B>&#9;<A NAME="_DV_M45"></A><B>8 5/8% Senior Notes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 24, 2003, the Company sold $220,000 aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8 Senior Notes due 2011. The proceeds of the offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were $197,000. These proceeds, together with funds available from other sources, were used to repay existing 12.5% Senior Subordinated Notes of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The fees paid to the initial purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes of $22,191 were made pursuant to arrangements originally entered into in December 2001. The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of the existing Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result, both the fees of $22,191 paid in April 2003 and the unamortized loan costs of $6,217 associated with the Senior Subordinated Notes, were expensed in the second quarter 2003.</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_DV_M46"></A><BR>
 (iii)&#9;5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M47"></A>In March 1998, the Company issued $125.0 million of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes (the "5.75% Notes") due 2005 of which $34.2 million remain outstanding after an exchange of $90.9 million principal amount of 5.75% Notes for 3,266,850 shares of the Company's Class A common stock in 2001 and 2002.  The Company incurred non-cash, pre-tax charges of approximately $21.0 million in connection with these exchanges.  The remaining 5.75% Notes may be converted into common stock at a conversion price of $28.594 per share at any time prior to maturity, subject to adjustment under certain conditions.  The Company may redeem the remaining 5.75% Notes, in whole or in part, at a premium plus accrued interest.  Concurrently with the Company's issuance of the 5.75% Notes in March 1998, Industrier, the controlling stockholder of the Company, purchased approximately $67.9 million principal amount of a 5.75% convertible subordinated note (the "Industrier Note").  In connection
 with the Company's financing of the acquisition of the oral solid dose pharmaceutical business from Mayne Nickless in 2001 ("Faulding Acquisition") (See "U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals - Acquisitions"), the Industrier Note was converted into 2,372,897 shares of Class B common stock of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Industrier Note. </P>
<B><P><A NAME="_DV_M48"></A>(iv)&#9;3.0% Convertible Subordinated Notes </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M49"></A>In June 1999, the Company issued $170.0 million principal amount of 3.0% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2006 (the "3% Notes") of which $122.0 million remain outstanding.  The Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax charge of approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2002 in connection with the exchange of $53.4 million in principal amount of the 3% Notes for 3,433,104 shares of the Company's Class A common stock.  The remaining 3% Notes pay cash interest of 3% per annum, calculated on the initial principal amount of the 3% Notes.  The remaining 3% Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into 31.1429 shares of the Company's Class A common stock per one thousand dollars of initial principal amount of 3% Notes.  The 3% Notes will mature at a price of 134.104% of the initial principal amount.  The payment of the principal amount of the 3% Notes at maturity (or earlier, if the 3% Notes are redeemed by the Company
 prior to maturity), together with cash interest paid over the term of the 3% Notes, will yield investors 6.875% per annum.</P></DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M50"></A>De-leveraging Strategy</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M51"></A>To better assure the Company's debt covenant compliance and to increase operating flexibility, the Company has implemented a strategy to de-leverage its balance sheet.  Pursuant to this strategy, in 2002 the Company undertook a series of initiatives which included expense, capital spending and working capital controls and a focus on increasing free cash flow.  In 2002, the Company exchanged $110.0 million of its 5% Notes and 3% Notes for the Company's Class A common stock as described above, and through its focus on managing its working capital generated $162.2 million of net operating cash flow.  Primarily, as a result of these actions the Company was able to reduce its outstanding debt in 2002 by $164.7 million.  During 2003, primarily through a continued increased focus on cash flow, the Company was able to reduce its outstanding debt to $817 million.  The Company intends to continue its focus on free cash flow in 2004.  In addition, the Company is actively pur
suing the possible sale of assets.  It is possible that, if completed, one or more divestitures may materially alter the Company's financial status; including without limitation, the potential that one or more such transactions could result in losses of up to $100 million and could be dilutive to the Company's continuing earnings per share.  The Company is also considering the re-financing of its outstanding convertible debt.  <A NAME="_DV_M52"></A></P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M68"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Human Pharmaceuticals business is comprised of USHP, IG, and API businesses.  USHP is comprised of U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and Branded Pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M69"><A NAME="_DV_M70"></A></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, a plan was developed where, during 2004, an integrated management team will commence managing the IG and U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals business units, while API and Branded Pharmaceuticals will be managed by separate management teams.  Also in 2003, the Human Pharmaceuticals organization was further realigned to maximize operational efficiencies by the institution of key global roles to oversee supply chain and scientific affairs functions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M71"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals business had sales of approximately $1,017.0 million<A NAME="_DV_C5"><B> </B>and</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>operating income of approximately $128.9 million<A NAME="_DV_M72"></A></A><B>.  </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M73"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets its primary products, generic pharmaceuticals, through its IG and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals businesses.  The Human Pharmaceuticals business also markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals in the U.S. through its Branded Pharmaceuticals unit. In addition, through API, the Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets a line of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  Through acquisitions, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS ("API")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M91"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's API business develops, manufactures and markets a range of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products.  The Company's API business benefits from over four decades of experience in the use and development of fermentation and purification technology.  Additionally, the Company's API business' fermentation expertise in the production of bulk antibiotics has a direct technological application to the manufacture of products for the Company's Animal Health business.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M92"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines.  </I>The Company's API business markets and sells approximately 10 APIs in 28 grades.  APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections.  The Company is a leading producer of vancomycin as well as a producer of bacitracin and polymyxin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics.  The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotics such as amphotericin B parenteral grade and colistin for injectable use and use in specialized topical and surgical human applications.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M93"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is expanding certain of its facilities in order to address capacity constraints with respect to some of the products in its API business' portfolio.  (See "Facilities" below.)  In February 2003, the Company's API business implemented a significant price increase targeted at certain of its products.  The impact of this price increase in 2004 will be influenced by the continued acceptance of the increased 2003 price levels by a majority of its customers.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M94"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities.  </I>The Company manufactures its API products in its plants in Oslo, Norway, which also manufactures products for Animal Health; Copenhagen, Denmark, which also manufactures finished products for IG; and Budapest, Hungary.  Each plant includes fermentation, specialized recovery and purification equipment.  To support the production of vancomycin, the Company substantially expanded its production capacity at its Copenhagen facility and acquired a facility in Budapest, Hungary in December 1998.  An expansion of manufacturing processes and capacity at the Budapest facility is substantially complete<B>.  <A NAME="_DV_C9"></B>As of January 2004, the expansion of the Budapest facility cost approximately $9.0 million and doubled the capacity of the facility for one product and established capacity for the production of three additional products in the facility.<B>  <A NAME="_DV_M95"></A></A></B>(See "Information Applicable to all
 Business Segments- Environmental Compliance" for a discussion of an administrative action related to the Budapest facility.)  The Oslo and Copenhagen facilities have been classified as acceptable by the FDA as a manufacturer of certain sterile and non-sterile bulk antibiotics.  Such FDA classification allows imports of these products into the U.S. market and by the health authorities of most European countries.  The Company is continuing to expand its facility in Copenhagen to increase its capacity<B>.<A NAME="_DV_C10"></B>  In the 1st quarter of 2004, all expansion of the Copenhagen facility is expected to be completed which will increase the facility's capacity for vancomycin by approximately 50%.  The total cost for this expansion is approximately $16.7 million.</A>  The Company is also expanding the Copenhagen facility for purification of tobramycin for a cost of approximately $10 million, which is expected to be substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2004<B>.</P>
</B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M96"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition.  </I>In sales to large and small customers, price, quality and service are the determining factors.  The Company believes that its fermentation and purification expertise and established reputation provide it with a significant advantage in these antibiotic products.  Competition may increase in the future as a result of the Company's recent price increases on certain of its products.  The Company's API business' principal competitors are Eli Lilly and Company, Abbott Laboratories and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M97"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic Markets.</I>  The Company's API business sells its active pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and other areas of the world.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, sales in North America of API products represented approximately 66% of the Company's API business' total revenues with significant additional sales of products in Europe, Asia and Latin America.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M98"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales and Distribution and Customers.  </I>Sales of API products are dependent on finished product sales which are under the control of the Company's customers.  Sales of bulk antibiotic products are made to relatively few large customers, primarily pharmaceutical companies making generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  The Company distributes and sells its API products in North America and Europe using its own sales force.  Sales of the Company's API products in other parts of the world are primarily through the use of local agents and distributors. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3 COLOR="#ffffff"> </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M74"></A>INTERNATIONAL GENERICS ("IG") </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M75"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IG develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceuticals for human use.  The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of generic oral solid dose pharmaceuticals in Europe, with a substantial presence in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.  IG also has a growing presence in Southeast Asia.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M76"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines</I>.  IG manufactures and markets prescription and over-the-counter products using approximately 260 APIs that are sold primarily in approximately 685 different formulations and dosage forms including tablets, capsules, ointments, creams, liquids, suppositories and injections.  This includes generic products in approximately 515 tablet and capsule formulations and dosages, approximately 60 liquid formulations and dosages, approximately 60 cream and ointment formulations and dosages for topical use, and approximately 50 injectable formulations and dosages.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M77"><A NAME="_DV_M78"></A></A>Prescription Pharmaceuticals</I></U>.  IG has regulatory approvals for approximately 215 prescription products, with a total of approximately 585 formulations and dosage strengths.  IG's prescription products comprise a broad product line, concentrating on antibiotic, analgesic/antirheumatic, psychotropic cardiovascular, cough and cold, and corticosteroid therapeutic areas.  These products are predominantly sold on a generic basis. </P>
<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M79"></A>Over-the-Counter Products</I></U>.  IG has regulatory approvals for approximately 45 over-the-counter products, with a total of approximately 100 formulations and dosage strengths.  IG has a broad range of products in different product categories including skin care, gastrointestinal care and pain relief.  Its range of products also includes vitamins, fluoride tablets, adhesive bandages and surgical tapes, among others.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M80"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions and Divestitures</I>.  In May 1998, the Company acquired Arthur H. Cox and Co. Ltd. (renamed Alpharma Limited), one of the leading generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United Kingdom, from Hoechst AG for a purchase price of approximately $198.0 million.  Alpharma Limited manufactures and markets tablets, capsules, suppositories, liquids, ointments and creams.  Alpharma Limited's main operations, which consist primarily of a manufacturing plant, warehousing facilities and a sales organization, are located in Barnstaple, England.  Alpharma Limited distributes its products to pharmacy retailers and pharmaceuticals wholesalers, primarily in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M81"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in November 1998, in a substantially smaller transaction, the Company acquired a generic pharmaceutical product line in Germany.  The purchase price paid by the Company for this acquisition was $13.3 million.  This amount was paid in cash in November 1998.  All of the products purchased in this transaction are manufactured under long-term contracts with third parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M82"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1999, the Company acquired a market presence in the German generic market through the purchase of the Isis group of companies, (renamed Alpharma-ISIS GmbH &amp; Co. KG) ("Alpharma-ISIS"), from Schwarz Pharma AG for a purchase price of approximately $153.0 million.  Alpharma-ISIS has a substantial marketing organization but no manufacturing operations.  All products are manufactured for Alpharma-ISIS by third parties, including a substantial number under a supply agreement with Schwarz Pharma that expires in 2008 (with annual renewal rights upon mutual agreement of the parties).  Under the Company's agreement with Schwarz Pharma, the Company purchases products from Schwarz Pharma at a price based on an index, with no minimum purchases or payment requirements.  The agreement provides that if the market price of a given product decreases by more than 30%, the price is subject to renegotiation.  In the event of a force majeure relatin
g to a product, the Company may purchase such product from other manufacturers.  The Company's total purchases under the Schwarz Pharma agreement totaled $14.5 million in 2003. Approximately 73.7% of Alpharma-ISIS' sales are of cardiovascular products, the most important of which in terms of sales is the drug Pentalong.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M83"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired 90% of Alpharma (Foshan) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (formerly Foshan Faulding Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.) ("Alpharma Foshan").  A corporation controlled by the government of the City of Foshan owns the remaining 10% of Alpharma Foshan.  Alpharma Foshan manufactures and distributes generic oral pharmaceutical products in the southern and eastern portions of China.  (See "U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals - Acquisitions" for a discussion of the Faulding acquisition.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M84"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2003, the Company divested its vitamin business to Nopal AS ("Nopal"), which, at the time of such transaction, was a subsidiary of Industrier, the Company's controlling stockholder, for approximately $3.3 million.  In connection with this sale, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Nopal pursuant to which the Company will supply Nopal with certain vitamin products, and two distribution agreements with Nopal pursuant to which Nopal would continue to sell the Company's medical plaster and tape products to the grocery sector and the Company would sell Nopal's acquired vitamin products to the pharmacy and health care sector.  The supply agreement and distribution agreements were terminated on December&nbsp;31, 2003 and February 27, 2004, respectively. The Company expects the termination of these agreements to have a minimal impact on its operations in 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_IPM1"><A NAME="_DV_C6"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2003, <A NAME="_DV_X2604"><A NAME="_DV_C7"></A>the Company divested its <A NAME="_DV_C8"></A></A>French generic pharmaceutical business to Zydus International Private Ltd for approximately $6.0 million plus further payments of approximately $600,000, contingent upon receipt of marketing approvals from the French government for certain products in the approval process as of the date of the sale.</A>  This business was purchased in April 1999 for $26.4 million.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M85"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities</I>.  The Company maintains six manufacturing facilities for its IG products, all of which also house administrative offices and warehouse space.  The Company's plants in Lier, Norway and Barnstaple, England, include many technologically advanced applications for the manufacturing of tablet, liquid and ointment products.  The Company's plant in Copenhagen, Denmark manufactures a limited number of sterile finished pharmaceutical products.  In addition to the Lier, Barnstaple and Copenhagen facilities, the Company also operates plants in Vennesla, Norway, for medical plaster and tape products, and Jakarta, Indonesia, for tablets, ointments and liquids.  The Jakarta plant exports certain products to Europe.  Through Alpharma Foshan, the Company also operates a manufacturing plant in Foshan City in the Guangdong Province of China.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M86"><A NAME="_DV_M87"></A></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition</I>.  Most of the Company's international finished pharmaceutical products compete with one or more other products that contain the same active ingredient in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company therefore competes on the basis of price, product range, service and brand.  IG's principal competitors are Ratiopharm Inc., Hexal AG, Merck KGaA, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and Sandoz GmbH.  In European countries in recent years, sales of generic pharmaceuticals have been increasing relative to sales of patent-protected pharmaceuticals.  Generics are gaining market share on a volume basis because, among other things, governments are attempting to reduce pharmaceutical expenses by enacting regulations that promote the use of generic pharmaceuticals in lieu of more expensive branded formulations.  The Company's international generic products also encounter competition from imports
 of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws promoting free movement of goods.  It is also encountering increased pressure from new entrants into the market, many of whom are from countries with a lower cost basis (such as China, India and countries in Eastern Europe), and therefore, are able to supply product at lower prices.  The Company is considering moving production to, or sourcing products from suppliers in, lower cost territories to meet this competitive force.  To remain competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market, it is also critical that scheduled product launches enter the market on time.  Additionally, in certain EU jurisdictions such as the U.K. and Germany, maximum pricing legislation is resulting in lower prices and impacting the Company's ability to compete on the basis of price in such jurisdictions.  (See "Government Regulation" and "Risk Factors".) </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M88"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic Markets</I>.  The principal geographic markets for IG's products are the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands, France, the Nordic countries and other Western European countries, Indonesia, China and the Middle East.  Additionally, the Company has sales in select other Asian and African markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M89"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers</I>.  Depending on the characteristics of each geographic market, IG's products are predominantly marketed under either brand or generic names.  Over-the-counter products are typically marketed under brand names with concentration on skin care, pain relief and vitamins.  IG's primary customers are integrated wholesalers (wholesale and retail outlets), pharmacy retail chains, purchasing organizations and government entities.  To position itself towards the integrated wholesalers who are gradually becoming significant Pan-European parties, IG is targeting both the local market organizations and the corporate offices of these customers.  IG employs a specialized marketing and sales force of approximately 530 persons (with the largest being 204 in Indonesia, 58 in China and 128 in Germany) that markets and promotes generic pharmaceuticals to doctors, hospitals, wholesalers, pharmacies and consumers.  In ea
ch of the Company's international markets, it uses wholesalers to distribute its generic pharmaceutical products.  </P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M100"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business develops, manufactures, markets and distributes generic prescription, specialty branded and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals for human use.  With products in over 150 formulations and dosage forms, USHP is a market leader in generic solid, liquid and topical dosage forms, with what the Company believes to be one of the broadest portfolios of these dosage forms in the generic pharmaceuticals industry.  With the addition of Purepac, an oral solid dose pharmaceutical business purchased as part of the Faulding Acquisition completed in 2001, the Company's liquid and topical customers can buy a broadened product line from the Company, instead of having to purchase oral solid dose pharmaceuticals from other vendors.   In 2002 and in 2003, USHP ceased producing a number of less profitable liquid products in order to concentrate on more profitable products while engaging in certain remediation efforts t
o meet FDA guidelines at its Baltimore facility. Profitability of the Company's oral solid dose products were adversely affected since the Company did not introduce significant new products during 2003.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M101"><A NAME="_DV_M102"></A></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines</I>.  USHP manufactures and markets products using approximately 165 APIs that are sold in over 150 different formulations and dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, creams, ointments, suppositories and liquid inhalants, in its line of over-the-counter and prescription medications.  The experience and technical expertise of USHP enables it to formulate immediate and modified release medications in oral solid dosage forms.  It also enables USHP to develop therapeutic equivalent drugs in liquid and topical forms, and refine product characteristics, such as taste, texture and appearance in the case of liquid forms, and color, texture and consistency in the case of topical forms.  USHP manufactures and markets generic prescription products in approximately 75 tablet and capsule formulations and dosages.  USHP manufactures approximately 50 generic cream, lotion and ointment formulations and
 dosages for topical use and 21 liquid formulations and dosage forms.  USHP also markets a line of respiratory products and unit dose liquids products consisting of 9 formulations and dosages.  USHP, through Branded Pharmaceuticals also manufactures and markets two branded prescription drug products in a tablet and capsule dosage forms.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M103"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic Prescription Pharmaceuticals</I>.  USHP has regulatory approvals, each of which permits USHP to manufacture and sell a given product, for approximately 130 generic prescription products with a total of approximately 176 dosage strengths.  The prescription products consist of a line of specialty liquid products for approximately 10 different indications, including cough/cold, allergy and respiratory, a broad line of creams and ointments with a concentration on first aid medications, and a broad line of oral solid dose products with a concentration on modified release formulations in a variety of therapeutic categories including cardiovascular, anti-depressants, tranquilizers and analgesics. USHP's most successful generic drugs in 2003 were (i) diltiazem, the oral solid dose generic equivalent of Cardizem CD (indicated for the treatment of hypertension and chronic, stable angina), (ii) alprazolam, the oral solid dose equivalent 
of Xanax (indicated for the treatment and management of anxiety disorders, and (iii) spironolactone, the oral solid dose generic equivalent of Aldactone (indicated<B> </B>to treat high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, kidney and liver disease and conditions in which there are abnormally low levels of potassium in the blood.).  In addition, in 2003 the Company entered into an agreement with Ivax Pharmaceutical Co. ("Ivax") under which the Company will receive fifty percent (50%) of Ivax's net profits (as defined in the agreement) of Metformin ER (the extended release version of Metformin HCl) during the 180-day exclusivity period.  Such period commenced in December 2003 and the Company received approximately $9 million from Ivax for 2003 sales.  This exclusivity period ends in the second quarter of 2004.  During such 180-day exclusivity period, and under the agreement with Ivax, in the event that the Company launches its own Metformin ER product, the Company shall pay Ivax fifty percent (50%) of the 
Company's net profits (as defined in the agreement) on such sales of Metformin ER.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M104"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over-the-Counter Pharmaceuticals.</I>  USHP has the ability to manufacture ANDA and non-ANDA over-the-counter products.  In 2002 and continuing in 2003, USHP discontinued production of lower margin liquid over-the-counter products in order to focus on higher margin products and in order to take actions required to cause its Baltimore plant to comply with FDA regulations.  In the over-the-counter line, USHP has a broad range of products for approximately 8 different indications including allergy, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, cough/cold, first aid, feminine hygiene, nutritional and personal hair care.  USHP sells Feverall, an over-the-counter suppository form of acetaminophen used for fever reduction and pain relief. The Company acquired the marketing and distribution rights for this product from a third party in December 2000<B>.</B> </P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M107"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions</I>. In December 2001, the Company acquired U.S. based Purepac Pharmaceutical Co., a company specializing in the development, manufacture and marketing of generic oral solid dose pharmaceuticals, and Faulding Laboratories Inc., a company specializing in the marketing and distribution of branded pharmaceuticals, and China based Alpharma Foshan Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., a manufacturer and distributor of generic oral pharmaceuticals for approximately $670 million (the "Faulding Acquisition").  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M108"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities.  </I>USHP maintains and operates three manufacturing facilities, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and one automated central distribution center.  USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid pharmaceuticals.  (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".)  The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories.  As a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey.  <A NAME="_DV_C14">The Piscataway facility will require FDA approval prior to its use as a manufacturing plant.  The<A NAME="_DV_M109"></A></A> Company is<A NAME="_DV_M113"></A> currently utilizing the Piscataway facility for warehousing of inv

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M118"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition.  </I>Legislation in the U.S. encourages the use of generics as an alternative to brand drugs, including the use of generics in the Medicaid reimbursement program, and generally allows <A NAME="_DV_M119"></A>pharmacy substitution of brand drugs with generic drugs.  Nevertheless, while the Company is a market leader in the U.S. in the manufacture and marketing of specialty human generic pharmaceuticals, it operates in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company competes in this business on the basis of price, product range and service.  The Company competes with other generic pharmaceutical companies and with the generic drug divisions of major international branded drug companies that sell one or more products similar to the Company's products.  (See "Risk Factors" and  "Legal Proceedings - Gabapentin".)  Additionally, the Company encounters market entry resistance from patented drug manufacturers.  The Comp
any, as with other generic players, selectively attempts to introduce generic drugs, as it is currently attempting with gabapentin, earlier than the last expiration date for patents held by the manufacturer holding the patent protection through the process of designing around existing patents or challenging patents believed to be invalid or unenforceable (a "Waxman-Hatch paragraph IV Filing").  Under certain circumstances, if the Company is the first to file under paragraph IV, it may be entitled to be the only generic manufacturer on the market for a 180-day period.  The Company has encountered vigorous challenges to these activities that have resulted in significant legal costs as it has defended its right to market these products.  The Company expects to face further legal costs as it continues to defend such challenges.  The Company might be unsuccessful in defending these challenges.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branded Pharmaceuticals also operate in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company's Branded Pharmaceuticals products compete with products manufactured by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and worldwide research-based brand drug companies.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, AH had <A NAME="_DV_M126"></A>product sales of approximately <A NAME="_DV_C27">$295.7 million and operating income of approximately $<A NAME="_DV_M127"></A></A>20.1<B> </B>million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M128"><A NAME="_DV_M129"></A></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, Animal Health implemented a new business strategy that included strengthening customer and market focus and significantly improving working capital management.  As an additional part of AH's strategy, it <A NAME="_DV_M130"></A>conducted a review of its product pipeline relating to Reporcin, which resulted in the decision to cease further investment in the construction of a U.S. production facility for the product in Terre Haute, Indiana.  Additionally, it conducted an evaluation of its major contractual supplier relationships that has resulted in the termination or amendment of certain long-term relationships with suppliers.  In 2002, the Company also determined that consolidation of existing manufacturing activity was necessary, resulting in the closure of its manufacturing facilities in Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, and   <A NAME="_DV_M131"></A>Parkville, Australia, and its research center in
 Wrightstown, New Jersey.  While AH completed these actions in 2003, write-offs and other charges against pre-tax income of approximately $152.1 million were recorded in 2002 in connection with such matters.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M151"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals for animals (including animal vaccines) must be reviewed and receive registration from the FDA and USDA for marketing in the United States and approval or registration by similar regulatory agencies in other countries.  Regulatory approvals for products to be used in food producing animals are complex due to the possible impact on humans. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M152"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval also must be granted in the U.S. for the use of a pharmaceutical product in combination with other pharmaceuticals.  Such combination approval generally requires the cooperation of other manufacturers to consent to authorize the Company to refer to such manufacturer's NADA in <A NAME="_DV_M153"></A>its regulatory submissions.  This consent is necessary to obtain approval from the FDA for more than one pharmaceutical product to be included in a given formulation of animal feed at the same time.  To date, the Company has been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many of its products.  Generally, the Company does not enter into written agreements with other manufacturers and does not pay any money to other manufacturers to obtain such consent.  These combination clearances significantly extend the reach and potential market share of the Company's products and provide a considerab
le competitive advantage.  Presently, the Company has sponsored a total of approximately 85 combination approvals in the U.S.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M154"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions</I>.  In 1999, the Company purchased the assets of I.D. Russell Company Laboratories, a manufacturer of a line of soluble antibiotics and vitamins, for approximately $22.0 million.  In addition, the Company made a payment to I.D. Russell Company Laboratories of $2.0 million in April 2002 upon receiving a license for one product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the Company acquired exclusive marketing rights to Reporcin, a performance and meat quality improvement product for injectable use in swine, from Natinco N.V. pursuant to a technology license and option agreement for approximately $14.1 million, $11.7 million of which was paid in connection with licenses related to Reporcin.  In addition, through December 31, 2003, the Company has paid approximately $13.6 million for additional licenses related to Reporcin.  Sales of Reporcin are ongoing in some countries, including Mexico and Brazil, which have substantial swine populations.  However, the full realization of the potential for Reporcin is dependent upon market acceptance in those two countries and governmental license approvals and market acceptance in numerous other countries, including the U.S.  The agreement requires payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets or payment of a li
quidated damages fee for not pursuing licenses in such countries equal to 10% of the product license payment that would otherwise have become due upon receipt of the product license. The Company's further liability under the agreement could be a maximum of $46.0 million (payable in Australian dollars and calculated at the exchange rate as of May 25, 2004) with respect to future licenses but the Company believes it has legal defenses which, if accepted, could result in no further license payments. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin.  To meet this requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June 2000 and began preparing the facility for production of Reporcin.  Due to a reassessment of the Company's approach to the U.S. market for Reporcin, the facility, on which the Company has expended $12 million, has not been completed and<A NAME="_DV_C29">, with Natinco's consent,<
A NAME="_DV_M156"></A></A> the Company has announced its intention to sell this facility.  Additionally, due to excess inventory of Reporcin, the Company has decided to cease manufacturing at its Parkville, Australia facility.  In the third quarter of 2002, the Company determined that certain tangible and intangible assets related to Reporcin were impaired and recorded a pre-tax charge of $37.1 million.  As part of its reassessment, the Company intends to investigate third-party manufacturing opportunities for the U.S. market and to continue to pursue regulatory approval for Reporcin in the U.S. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M157"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2000, the Company purchased the Roche MFA business for approximately $288.0 million.  The Roche MFA business consisted of products including Aureomycin, Bovatec, Avatec, Bio-Cox and Cygro.  These pharmaceuticals are used to prevent and treat diseases in livestock and poultry.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M158"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities.  </I>The Company produces its Animal Health products in several manufacturing facilities.  BMD is produced and blended at the Company's Chicago Heights, Illinois facility, which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant.  Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility, which is shared with API.  Soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH's Longmont, Colorado facility and feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH's Willow Island, West Virginia facility in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers.  It is then blended at independent blending facilities.  Bio-Cox is blended in AH's Van Buren, Arkansas facility, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at its Salisbury, Maryland facility.  The 3-Nitro product line <A NAME="_DV_M159"></A>is manufactured using the Company's technology at a third party facility.  In 2002, the Company commenced manufacturing Lasalocid test batches at its Willow Island facili
ty.  The Willow Island facility now produces Lasalocid for use in many parts of the world and anticipates commencing commercial production for sales in the U.S. upon receipt of approval from the FDA, which is expected during 2004.  Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in accordance with an agreement that expires in 2012 using the Company's technology at a facility owned and operated by a third party.  Blending of Deccox is done at the Company's Lowell, Arkansas facility <A NAME="_DV_M160"></A>(until June 2003) and a third party facility.  In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved to the Company's Chicago Heights facility.  Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities.  The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production.  The Company has closed its facilities at Hanni
bal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and its research and development facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey.  Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required.  The Wrightstown facility was sold during 2003.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M161"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition.  </I>The Company competes in this highly competitive, price sensitive business on the basis of price, brand name and customer service.  Some of the Company's competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities.  AH's principal competitors are Eli Lilly and Company, Phibro Animal Health Corporation, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Novartis AG.  Due to the Company's strong market position in feed additives and its experience in obtaining requisite FDA approvals for combination therapies, the Company believes it enjoys a competitive advantage in commercializing FDA-approved combination medicated animal feed additives.  However, no assurances can be given that third parties will continue to cooperate in seeking combination approval for the Company's products, and the Company expects new entrants in the generic medicated animal feed additive market in 2003. <
/P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M162"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic Markets.  </I>The Company sells a major portion of its animal health products in the U.S.  With the addition of the Roche MFA business, AH has expanded its international presence.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products in Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, the U.S., Chile and other international markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M163"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales and Distribution.  </I>The Company's animal health products in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and other selected markets are sold through a staff of 117 technically trained sales and service employees, many of whom are veterinarians and nutritionists.  The Company has sales offices in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Norway, Chile, Argentina, Thailand, China, Brazil, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Australia.  In the remainder of the world, AH's products are sold primarily through the use of distributors and sales companies.  In January 1999, the Company combined its wholly-owned U.S. distribution company with two similar third party distribution businesses to form a joint venture 50% owned by the Company.  <A NAME="_DV_C31">In January 2004, the 50% of this<A NAME="_DV_M164"></A></A><B> </B>joint venture<A NAME="_DV_C32"> that was owned by third parties was purchased by the Company.  In March 2004, subseque
nt to the period covered by this report, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 100% interest in this distribution company, subject to normal closing conditions.  This entity<A NAME="_DV_M165"></A></A><B> </B>is a regional distributor of animal health products in the Central Midwest and Southeastern regions of the U.S.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products through its own technically-trained sales staff in Norway, the United Kingdom and Chile and through distributors in other markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M166"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers.  </I>Sales are made principally to commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and integrated cattle, swine and poultry producers.  Although AH is not dependent on any one customer, the customer base for AH products is in a consolidation phase.  Therefore, as consolidation continues, the Company may become more dependent on certain individual customers as these customers increase their size and market share.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products to fish farms, usually under a contract that extends for at least one growing season.  There are relatively few customers for the Company's aquatic animal health products and there are relatively few suppliers of the products that the Company sells in this market.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M175"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.  <A NAME="_DV_M176"><A NAME="_DV_M177"><A NAME="_DV_M178"><A NAME="_DV_M179"></A></A></A></A>  The Company conducts its technical product development activities for Animal Health at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Willow Island, West Virginia; and Chicago Heights, Illinois.  The technical product development for finished Human Pharmaceuticals products is conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland.  The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development.  Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for each of the business segments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M183"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development activities are inherently speculative.  Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product.  For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation.  Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M184"></A>New Product Pipeline</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M185"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a pipeline of new products that it plans to introduce over the next several years.  However, the introduction of new human pharmaceutical products in the U.S. has been adversely impacted by FDA regulatory activities at both its Elizabeth and Baltimore facilities; activities which continue at the date of this Report.  One of the most potentially significant products in the Company's pipeline is USHP's generic form of gabapentin.  Gabapentin is a generic version of Neurontin, a drug indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, which had 2003 brand sales of over  $2.5 billion.  In 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that <A NAME="_DV_M186"></A>Purepac <A NAME="_DV_M187"></A>was the first generic manufacturer to file a paragraph IV certification challenging the patents protecting Neurontin.  Federal District and Appellate Courts subsequently affirmed this conclusion during 2003.  As the first entity to file a
 paragraph IV certification with respect to the primary continuing gabapentin patents, the Company is in a position to benefit from generic market exclusivity for up to six months.  Exclusivity is subject to receipt of all required FDA approvals, which the Company presently possesses for gabapentin.<A NAME="_DV_C43">  Any commercial sale of the product prior to <A NAME="_DV_M188"></A></A>the satisfactory resolution of the brand company's litigation challenge <A NAME="_DV_C45">would result in a risk<A NAME="_DV_M189"></A></A><B> </B>of <A NAME="_DV_C47">patent infringement damages.<A NAME="_DV_M190"></A></A>  The Company may not, in all circumstances, be able to control the commencement of the exclusivity period and therefore can give no assurance that it will benefit from being the first to file the paragraph IV certification.  If the Company gains this exclusivity, based upon the results of similar generic product launches in the past, the Company believes it can reasonably expect a significant initial mark

The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other government agencies and by comparable authorities in the EU, Norway, Indonesia and other countries.  Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is a member of the European Economic Area and, as such, has accepted all EU regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals except in the area of feed antibiotics.  Government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  Non-compliance with applicable re

     The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements (including the possibility of future changes in statutes or regulations), the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and analogous state and foreign agencies, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time the Company will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite the Company's efforts to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.

Drug products which are generic copies of the other types of branded products generally may be marketed in accordance with either FDA enforcement policies or the over-the-counter drug monograph program which describes active ingredients and labeled uses the FDA has determined are safe and effective and do not require NDA approval and generally are not subject to ANDA filings and approval prior to market introduction at this time.  While the Company believes that the Company's current pharmaceutical products are appropriately marketed under the applicable FDA procedure or current enforcement policy, the basis for marketing products not covered by approved ANDAs is sub
ject to change or revocation by the FDA.  The status of all products is also subject to change if experience reveals significant new adverse information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     All applications for regulatory approval of generic drug products subject to ANDA requirements must contain data relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and quality control, among other information.  ANDAs also must contain data demonstrating the bioequivalence of the generic drug to the branded drug.  Each product approval limits manufacturing to a specifically identified site or sites.  Supplemental filings to allow the manufacture of products at new sites also generally require review and approval.  In addition, certain changes to our manufacturing process, drug ingredients and labeling also can require regulatory review and approval.  New product approvals or approvals to change products might not be obtained in a timely manner, if ever.  Failure to obtain these approvals, or to obtain them when expected, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>

     Some of the Company's animal pharmaceuticals are regulated by the FDA, similarly to the human pharmaceuticals, while other animal pharmaceuticals are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Although the Company markets some generic animal pharmaceuticals, which are subject to similar FDA requirements as applicable to its human generic pharmaceutical products, many of its animal pharmaceuticals are considered to be branded or pioneer animal drug products.  Like their human counterparts, pre-marketing approval under stringent FDA rules for their testing, development, and manufacture is required for animal drugs as well as for any changes in label claims, specifications or manufacturing sites that occur post-approval.  The enormous backlog of submissions pending review in FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine has made the timing of such approvals difficult to predict.  Despite the difficulty and delays brought about by this situation, the Company has been successful in obtaining such approvals.  A
s with human pharmaceutical products, FDA inspection and record keeping requirements as well as debarment provisions apply to the Company's Animal Health products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     Legislative bills are introduced in the U.S. Congress from time to time, some of which, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on Animal Health's business.  However, in the past, such bills that could have had a material adverse effect, have not had sufficient support to become law.  The animal pharmaceutical industry is actively engaged in the legislative process.  To address the previously mentioned review backlog, the industry supported legislation that would adopt user fees and performance standards similar to those in place for new human drugs and medical devices.  The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 is now in effect (providing for such fees and standards).  The Company believes that this legislation will make the regulatory process for some of the Company's Animal Health products more predictable in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     EU legislation requires that medical products for human use must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the EU.  The criteria upon which grant of an authorization is assessed are quality, safety and efficacy.  Demonstration of safety and efficacy in particular requires clinical trials on human subjects, which are subject to the standards codified in the EU guideline on Good Clinical Practice; provided that certain countries granted membership in the EU as of May 1, 2004 may, until a given date specified for each country, individually authorize the continued marketing of products that do not qualify for marketing authorization under EU law if such products were approved by the individual country prior to being granted EU membership.  In addition, the EU legislation requires that such trials be preceded by adequate pharmacological and toxicological tests in animals, that stability tests are to be carried out, that clinical trials use controls and that clinical trials be car
ried out double blind and be capable of statistical analysis by using specific criteria wherever possible, rather than relying on a large sample size.  The working party on the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products has also made various recommendations in this area.  Analogous governmental and agency approvals are similarly required in other countries where the Company conducts business.  There can be no assurance that new product approvals will be obtained by the Company in a timely manner, if ever.  Failure to obtain these approvals, or to obtain them when expected, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     Similar requirements apply to the granting of marketing authorizations for medicinal products for veterinary use in EU countries.  If the Company fails to obtain such marketing authorizations, or to obtain them timely, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's Animal Health business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     Generic medicinal products for human and veterinary use may be authorized in the EU through abridged authorization applications.  For example, the EU marketing authorization applications do not need to contain results of toxicological and pharmacological tests and results of clinical trials provided that certain conditions are met, and in particular that the "original" medicinal product has been authorized in the EU for at least six years (and in certain cases ten years) and has been in the market in the member state where the marketing authorization application has been submitted.  Abridged applications must refer to information contained in the dossier of the "original" product for which a marketing authorization has been granted on the basis of a complete dossier.  The original complete dossier in question must be a dossier at the disposal of the competent authority concerned.  This implies that abridged applications must be lodged with the authorities that actually hold the dossier for the "original
" product.  The "original" product referred to must still be authorized at the time of the abridged application is submitted.  To qualify for abridged dossiers, the product must be considered as "essentially similar" to the original medicinal product.  There is no EU definition of this "essentially similar" condition.  Based on the interpretation of the European Court of Justice, a medicinal product is deemed "essentially similar" to the original product when it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active principles/substances, the same pharmaceutical form and is bioequivalent unless it is apparent in the light of scientific knowledge that it differs significantly from the original product regarding safety or efficacy.  If the Company fails to satisfy the conditions for the use of abridged authorization applications for new products being developed by the Company, the process for the approval of such products could take significantly longer and cost substantially more to the Comp
any.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     As of October 30, 2005, changes to the abridged authorization procedure described above will be implemented for human pharmaceuticals.  These changes will require submission of an environmental risk assessment in connection with an application for a marketing authorization and will permit the filing of an application for a generic drug marketing authorization 8 years after the date upon which the reference drug was granted marketing rights with the commencement of generic marketing permitted no earlier than 10 years after the date the reference drug was granted marketing rights.  In some cases, this change will eventually delay the introduction of generic drugs, such as the Company's products, by 2 years in those countries which presently apply a 6 year exclusivity period. </P>

     The European Union and five non-EU countries have banned the use of four antibiotics to promote growth in food producing animals effective July 1, 1999, and will extend this ban to the remaining approved growth promoting antibiotics by 2006.  While three of these products were not manufactured or sold by us, bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic growth promoter for livestock and poultry which is manufactured by us, is included in the ban.  The Company's attempt to reverse or limit the EU ban that affects the Company's Albac product, was not successful.  Similar actions to ban or severely restrict the use in animals of antibiotics have been taken by EU trading partners or are being contemplated. (See "Risk Factors".)</P>

     Requirements similar to those in the U.S. and EU apply to the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations for pharmaceutical products in Asia and Africa.  Therefore, the Company must comply with local requirements that may be, but are not always, similar to those described above prior to receiving approvals for products in Asia and Africa.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facility Compliance</I>.  The Company's manufacturing operations in the U.S. and three of the Company's European facilities that manufacture products for export to the U.S. are required to comply with FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations ("cGMP").  cGMP encompasses all aspects of the production process, including validation and record keeping, in addition to standards for facilities, equipment and personnel, and involves changing and evolving standards.  Consequently, continuing compliance with cGMP can be a particularly difficult and expensive part of regulatory compliance.  There are similar cGMP regulations in other countries where the Company has manufacturing operations.  The EU requires that before a medicinal product can be manufactured and assembled, each company that carries out such an operation must hold a manufacturer's license and the manufacture and assembly must be in accordance with the marketing authorization and cGMP. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     The Company is subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA.  During 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Baltimore and Elizabeth, respectively.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from, primarily, cGMPs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has not formally commented on the Company's corrective action plan.  The FDA performed another inspection of the Baltimore facility in February of 2004 and issued a 483 Report detailing plant deficiencies.  While the FDA has not indicated to the Company its position as to any of the items set forth on this February 2004 483 Report, the number and scope of the comments has declined significantly from the Report received in August 2002.  The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore plant in accordance with the Octobe
r 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by the end of 2004.  As part of the corrective action plan, product recalls were conducted in 2002 and production at the Baltimore facility was reduced in several increments during 2002 and 2003.  This reduction in production has had an effect on earnings and the possibility of an adverse effect in 2004 was incorporated into the Company budgeting process. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     Between November 2002 and January 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA on January 15, 2003.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response on February 5, 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The Company originally anticipated completion of these actions on or about the end of 2003.  However, the FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report alleging continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations.  As a result the Company now anticipates completion of a significant portion of its corrective actions in mid 2004, with the remainder by March 2005.  Certain product recalls were included in the original corrective action plan which were completed in 2002 and 2003.  The regulatory status and the Company's corrective action activities of both of these facilitie
s has had, and continues to have, an adverse impact on the Company's ability to launch new product marketing approvals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     The Company incurred costs of $3.2 million during 2002 and approximately an additional $18 million of outside consultant costs in 2003.  The Company estimates that the 2004 cost of addressing the deviations listed in those 483 Reports at Baltimore and Elizabeth will be approximately $8 million for outside consultants and related costs.  In addition, the Company has expanded its ongoing quality assurance costs, including adding related personnel, at an estimated cost of approximately $18 million in 2004. (See "Risk Factors" and "Legal Proceedings".)  The Company has received 483 Reports from time to time in the past for other plants, all of which the Company believes it has adequately addressed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     During 2003, the Company also received a 483 Report at its API facility in Copenhagen, Denmark.  This Report, which the Company believes it has adequately addressed, relates to the manufacturing process for one of the less significant products of the Company's API business, with 2003 sales to the United States of $587,000.  The FDA has informed the Company that it has classified the facility as acceptable with respect to the manufacture of nonsterile active pharmaceutical ingredients, subject to an evaluation of the corrections described in the Company's response to the FDA at its next regularly scheduled inspection.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     Further with regard to cGMPs, in August 2002, the FDA announced a major new initiative on the regulation of drug product quality entitled "Pharmaceuticals cGMPs for the 21st Century."  The two-year program is intended to ensure, among other things, that regulatory review and inspection policies are based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science and to encourage the adoption of new technological advances by the pharmaceutical industry.  Additionally, risk-based approaches, that focus both industry and FDA attention on critical areas, will be implemented.  Although the Company expects this initiative to increase the cost of compliance in the short-term, the Company believes that it will result in cost-savings in the long-term.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential Liability for Current Products</I>.  Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products, including the Company's products, and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.  While the Company believes that it is unlikely that an adverse finding in any single study regarding any of the Company's products will result in such regulatory measures without further findings, publicity raised by such a study could cause some of the Company's customers to decrease or stop their use of such product, resu
lting in an adverse affect on the sales of such product.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Protection for Certain Products</I>.  In 1984, The Waxman-Hatch Act amended both the Patent Code and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, better known as the FDC Act.  The Waxman-Hatch Act codified and expanded application procedures for obtaining FDA approval for generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals that are off-patent or whose market exclusivity has expired.  The Waxman-Hatch Act also provides patent extension and market exclusivity provisions for innovator drug manufacturers which preclude the submission or delay the approval of a competing ANDA under certain conditions.  One such provision allows a five year market exclusivity period for NDAs involving new chemical entities and a three year market exclusivity period for NDAs or NDA supplements containing new clinical investigations essential to the approval of such application.  The market exclusivity provisions apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products.  Another provision authorizes th
e extension of patent terms for up to five years as compensation for some of the reductions of the effective life of the patent as a result of time spent in testing for, and FDA review of, an application for a drug approval.  Patent terms may also be extended pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, or URAA.  In addition, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 ("FDAMA") allows brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers under certain circumstances to seek six months of additional exclusivity when they have conducted pediatric studies on the drug in accordance with the statute's requirements.  Although the pediatric exclusivity provisions in FDAMA contained a sunset date of January 1, 2002, they were re-authorized by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was signed into law in January 2002.  In addition, the first generic applicant who files an ANDA challenging a patent listed by the brand name manufacturer (i.e. an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification stating that the generic drug
 will not infringe any listed patent(s) for the reference drug or that such patent(s) is (are) invalid or unenforceable) may receive an exclusivity period of 180 days under certain circumstances during which times other generic applications for the product containing paragraph IV certifications cannot be approved.  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare Act") made certain changes to the 180-day exclusivity provision and placed additional limits on the circumstances under which first ANDA applicants may be able to enjoy the benefits of exclusivity.  Therefore, the Company cannot predict the extent to which the Waxman-Hatch Act, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, the FDAMA, the Medicare Act or URAA could postpone approval of some of the Company's new products.  Moreover, changes in the statutes or regulations may occur over time.  The Company cannot predict the extent to which any such future changes may affect its products or product development.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     In Europe, a similar market exclusivity in respect of proprietary medicines exists, irrespective of any patent protection.  Before a generic manufacturer can present an abridged application for a marketing authorization, it must generally wait until the original proprietary drug has been approved in the EU for a certain period, unless they have the consent of the person who submitted the original test data for the first marketing authorization, or can compile an adequate dossier of their own.  In the case of high technology products, the period is ten years or in some states for other medicinal products six years, subject to the option for member states to elect for an exclusivity period of ten years with respect to all products.  As of October 30, 2005, the exclusivity period across EU countries will be harmonized to 8 years for the submission of an abridged application and 10 years for generic marketing (as detailed above).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     In addition to the exclusivity period, it is also possible in the EU to extend the period of patent protection for a product which has a marketing authorization by means of a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.  An SPC comes into force on the expiry of the relevant patent and lasts for a period calculated with reference to the delay between the filing of the patent and the granting of the first marketing authorization for the drug.  This period of protection, subject to a maximum of five years, further delays the marketing of generic medicinal products, such as some of the Company's products.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlled Substances Act</I>.  The Company also manufactures and sells drug products which are "controlled substances" as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, which establishes certain security personnel, reporting, record keeping and import and export requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, a division of the Department of Justice.  The Company is registered by the DEA to manufacture and distribute certain controlled substances.  The DEA has a dual mission: law enforcement and regulation.  The former deals with the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them.  The DEA shares enforcement authority with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another division of the Department of Justice.  The DEA's regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed handlers of controlled substances, and with the substances themselves, equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packag

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Care Reimbursement</I>.  The methods and level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products under Medicare, Medicaid, and other domestic reimbursement programs are the subject of constant review by state and federal governments and private third party payors like insurance companies.  The Company believes that U.S. government agencies will continue to review and assess alternative payment methodologies and reform measures designed to reduce the cost of drugs to the public.  As a part of this effort the federal government and several states have commenced administrative or court actions challenging the pricing practices of certain named drug manufacturers.  The Company is a party to one such action brought on behalf of a state government and has been notified that several other states are investigating the Company with respect to this issue.  Because the outcome of these and other health care reform initiatives is uncertain, the Company cannot predict what impact, if any, 
they will have on it. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
     Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's selling price based on sales of outpatient drug products reimbursed under state Medicaid programs.  The required rebate rate for manufacturers of generic products is currently 11% of the weighted average selling price for each product at the unit level. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In many countries in which the Company does business, other than the U.S., the initial prices of pharmaceutical preparations for human use are dependent upon governmental approval or clearance under governmental reimbursement schemes.  These government programs generally establish prices by reference to either manufacturing costs or the prices of comparable products.  Subsequent price increases may also be regulated.  In past years, as part of overall programs to reduce health care costs, certain European governments have prohibited price increases and have introduced various systems designed to lower prices.  A review of proposed legislative changes to the U.K. generic pharmaceutical market is currently ongoing and as part of the review an interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the U.K. has been introduced.  Maximum pricing legislation generally prohibits the sale of a product to consumers for a price in excess of a specified amount or limits t
he amount that a government or other payor will reimburse with respect to a specific product, which in many jurisdictions effectively limits the amount that the Company can charge for such product to the reimbursable amount.  In Germany, legislation was introduced in January 2002 which re-adjusted the existing fixed price system, requiring price reductions for certain human generic pharmaceutical products including a large number of the Company's products.  Additionally, while this new German law does permit pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs, there are several exceptions to this law that, in the Company's view, will make it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  During 2003, Germany adopted legislation which will have the effect of reducing the reimbursement level for many of the Company's products commencing in 2004.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states in the EU regulate the pricing of such products and, in some cases, limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services.  These controls can result in considerable price differences between member states.  There is also a Common External Tariff payable on import of medicinal products into the EU, though exemptions are available in respect of certain products allowing duty free importation.  Where there is no tariff suspension in operation in respect of a medicinal product, an application can be made to import the product duty free, but this is subject to review at the European level to establish whether a member state would be able to produce the product in question instead.  In addition, some of the Company's products are subject to a governmental quota that restricts the amount that can be imported duty free.</P>

In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials which may require additional regulatory approvals as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer.  Any significant interruption of supply from the Company's sole source suppliers that are related to products that generate more than $5 million in gross profits or any adverse event at any of its manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Seven raw mate

<P>RISK FACTORS</P>
</B></U><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's reports filed from time to time pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 include certain forward-looking statements.  Like any company subject to a competitive and changing business environment, the Company cannot guarantee the results predicted in any of the Company's forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Company depends on the development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's future success is largely dependent upon its ability to develop, manufacture and market commercially successful new products, including generic versions of human pharmaceutical products that are no longer subject to patent protection.  Generally, the successful commercial marketing of the Company's products depends on completing the following steps in a time frame to allow the Company to be among the first to market a particular product or the generic version of a product:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>developing and testing the product;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>proving that the product is safe and effective or, if a generic pharmaceutical, that the generic product is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug product; and </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>filing for and receiving regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell the product in a timely manner.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delays in the development, manufacture or marketing of new products will impact the Company's expenses and revenues.  The Company cannot be sure that any product presently going through the process set forth above, or which may be chosen by the Company to enter this process in the future, will result in the timely and profitable commercial launch of a new product. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts.  As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term.  Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing of receipt of governmental approvals, with respect to "paragraph IV certifications", can significantly affect the Company's future revenues and income.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time at which the Company files for regulatory approvals is particularly significant with respect to U.S. human pharmaceuticals when the Company is using procedures, known as "paragraph IV certification", to seek marketing approvals prior to the latest date as to which a third party may claim patent protection.  Gabapentin is the Company's most important presently outstanding paragraph IV filing. In the case of paragraph IV certifications, the first entity to file an application with the FDA will be eligible for 180 days of market exclusivity.  However, the use of this strategy may involve lengthy litigation, frequently against substantially larger and better-financed pharmaceutical companies and, even if successful, may not always result in an actual award of market exclusivity.  It is unlikely that the Company will be the first to file for all, or even a significant percentage, of its paragraph IV certifications and even less likely that any particular paragraph IV certification 
will actually result in the award of market exclusivity.  In addition, the cost of paragraph IV litigation has been approximately $5 million per year, and based upon the present paragraph IV filing rate, could increase in any one or more years in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has been and will continue to be affected by price competition and the extension of patent exclusivity.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's generic pharmaceuticals business has historically been subject to intense competition, particularly on the basis of price.  As patents and other bases for market exclusivity of branded pharmaceuticals expire, prices typically decline as generic competitors, such as the Company, enter the marketplace.  Normally, there is a further unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increases.  The timing of these price decreases is unpredictable and can result in a significantly curtailed period of profitability for a generic product.  In addition, brand name and patented pharmaceuticals manufacturers frequently take actions to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalents.  These actions may include:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">filing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">developing patented controlled-release products or other product improvements; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increasing marketing initiatives and filing of additional litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is experiencing price competition from products manufactured in countries (such as China and India) which may have a lower cost basis than products manufactured by the Company.  Such competition is expected to increase in future years.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's ability to raise, or in certain instances maintain, prices in its international pharmaceutical business has been and may continue to be severely limited due to a number of factors, including parallel imports and price regulation. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Europe, and to a more limited degree in other international markets, the Company is encountering price pressure from imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws of free movement of goods, which are known as parallel imports.  Parallel imports could lead to lower revenue and operating income for the Company.  The Company's international pharmaceuticals business is also affected by general governmental initiatives to reduce drug prices, including price controls or other restrictions on the Company's industry.  Parallel imports, governmental cost containment and other regulatory efforts could cause lower prices in certain markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany and the Nordic countries, where the Company has significant sales.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New entrants from lower cost countries are also negatively affecting product prices for the Company's products in Europe.  (See Price Competition risk factor above.) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     The United Kingdom Department of Health is currently reviewing proposed legislative changes to the United Kingdom generic pharmaceuticals market, and, as part of this review, introduced in August 2000 interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom. Maximum pricing legislation generally prohibits the sale of a product to consumers for a price in excess of a specified amount or limits the amount that a government or other payor will reimburse with respect to a specific product, which in many jurisdictions effectively limits the amount that the Company can charge for such product to the reimbursable amount. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, a downward trend in prices for the Company's human generic pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom resulting, at present, from competitive pressures with the potential for further price decreases as a result of future regulatory actions.  The Company is unable t
o predict the long-term impact these circumstances will have on the Company's United Kingdom operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.  German legislation, effected in January 2004, has required price reductions and larger patient co-payments for a large number of human generic pharmaceutical products, including a number of the Company's products.  New German legislation also permits pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs; however, there are several exceptions to this law which the Company believes will make it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  Overall, the Company expects German legislation to result in lower prices for human generic pharmaceutical products that are expected to result in decreased profitability for all industry participants, including the Company.  The Company is unable to predict the impact these circumstances will have on the Company's German operations and the pricing and sales o
f generic pharmaceuticals in Germany.  </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company does not know the ultimate impact of the infringement claims brought by Pfizer relating to gabapentin and does not know with any certainty if it will have to write-off inventory relating to gabapentin.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has filed a paragraph IV certification challenging the patents protecting Pfizer's Neurontin (gabapentin) tablets and capsules, a drug used to treat epilepsy.  While not assured, this filing could provide the Company with generic market exclusivity for a period of up to six months.  Given the size of the gabapentin market (over $2.5 billion in 2003) and the market price and share normally anticipated during a period of generic exclusivity, the Company's profit potential (which it is initially obligated to share equally with its supplier of the drug's active ingredient for a limited period) could be significant if the Company obtains market exclusivity.  Torpharm, a competitor that has filed an ANDA for gabapentin capsules, recently filed a lawsuit against the FDA seeking final approval for this ANDA.  Both the trial and appellate courts have entered orders effectively sustaining the Company's right to exclusivity after considering the allegations of Torpharm.  However, the 
Company can give no assurance that it will ultimately benefit from an exclusivity period.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pfizer has filed several lawsuits challenging the Company's position that it can introduce the product prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the Pfizer patents.  The Waxman-Hatch Act 30 month automatic bar against the Company's launch has expired and the Company is at present legally entitled to commence the sale of the capsule product prior to a final decision in the Pfizer litigation.  It is possible, however, that additional patents on gabapentin may be issued to Pfizer, which could result in additional patent infringement lawsuits being filed against the Company.  However, because of a change in FDA's regulations in August 2003, any new such lawsuits would not affect the timing of FDA's action on the ANDA.  The Company could also decide to wait to commence sales until the receipt of a court decision or any appeal.  A launch at any time before a final decision on Pfizer's claims would leave the Company exposed to potential material infringement damages if Pfizer were to ultim
ately prevail in the litigation.  In addition, in order to be prepared to take advantage of any applicable six month period of exclusivity, the Company would be required to produce significant amounts of inventory prior to any planned product launch and, perhaps, prior to knowing whether the Company has been finally awarded exclusivity or the receipt of a final court ruling in the Pfizer litigation.  In the event that Pfizer prevails in the litigation, the Company is not awarded exclusivity or the outcome of either of these events results in a significant launch delay, this inventory may no longer be commercially saleable, which would result in a write-off and a charge against the Company's income in the relevant period. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the launch of gabapentin, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (the "GAPI") of gabapentin under which the Company has acquired GAPI inventory.  The terms of the Company's agreement with the GAPI supplier will require the payment to the supplier of a portion of the Company's net sales of finished dose gabapentin product during any period of exclusivity ("Net Sales Split").  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had paid approximately $12,500 in partial payment of GAPI inventory.  The Company will make additional payments of approximately $22,800 and $10,500 in 2004 and 2005, respectively, for GAPI inventory received and ordered. All of these payments reduce the Net Sales Split on a dollar for dollar basis.  Other than outstanding purchase orders for GAPI to be received subsequent to year-end, the Company has no additional obligation to purchase additional GAPI inventory.  The Company cannot pre
dict the outcome of the gabapentin litigation; however, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, or other factors preventing the Company from selling the finished product, the Company will reassess the net realizable value of the GAPI, and may incur a charge to write-down GAPI to its net realizable value and record any required payments under the supply agreement.  The maximum charge could be approximately $46,000 based on GAPI currently on hand or ordered.  In addition, the Company is negotiating certain changes in the arrangement with its GAPI supplier which, if unsuccessful, could require the Company to make a $3,000 payment to the GAPI supplier.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The increased importance of sales to major wholesalers could continue to affect the Company's ability to charge higher prices for its products.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic pharmaceuticals market conditions, particularly in the U.S., have been affected in recent years by a fundamental shift in industry distribution, purchasing and stocking patterns resulting from the increased importance of sales to major wholesalers and a concurrent reduction in sales to private label generic distributors.  Wholesaler programs generally require lower prices on products sold, lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesaler's own marketing programs.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is subject to government regulations and actions that increase the Company's costs and could prevent it from marketing and selling some of its products in certain countries.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health products are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, record keeping, pricing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  While the Company does not keep records that segregate the cost of compliance with these government regulations, in the aggregate such regulations substantially increase the cost of manufacturing, developing and selling the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations.  These reviews can result in regulatory concerns requiring a response by the Company.  Failure to adequately address these concerns could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including product approval delays, reduced production and production interruptions, among other things.  The significance of the effect of any such failures depends on the severity of the remedy chosen by the government agency.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production or distribution and debarment of individuals from providing services to drug companies in any capacity or debarment of the Company from obtaining new drug approvals, resulting in current charges to income and the potential for future loss of income and increased operating expenses.  In recent years, besides stepped up enforcement of cGMP requirements, the federal government has utilized equit
able disgorgement as a means of enforcing compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations.  There can be no assurance that the FDA would not seek to impose similar sanctions on the Company and any such sanction could have a significant effect on the Company's business and operations.  (See the immediately following risk factor, which deals with corrective action plans involving cGMPs at the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are continually being conducted by the industry, government agencies (including studies required to be performed from time to time by the pharmaceutical company marketing a particular drug) and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ more sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from person who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.  The German government is requiring the Company to provide updated safety and efficacy data on the Company's Pentalong product on or before November of 2004.  If the Company cannot provide data satisfactory to the government, Pentalong's sales authority could be withdraw
n.  Pentalong 2003 sales were approximately $26.7 million with intangible assets totaling $15.0 million relating directly to Pentalong.  In the event that sales authority for Pentalong is withdrawn, the Company's operating income would be significantly impacted due to the profitability of this product and the Company would have to consider the impairment of the carrying value of the Pentalong intangible asset.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3 COLOR="#0000ff">  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has submitted comprehensive corrective action plans to the FDA in response to observations received at its Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.  Failure to adequately address these observations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2001 and 2002 and 2004, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facility in Baltimore.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from standards, primarily cGMPs.  The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation from the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree that required general compliance with cGMPs.  During 2003, the Company received two 483 Reports from the FDA as a result of an FDA inspection at its USHP facility in Elizabeth. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2002 inspection at Baltimore and the initial 2003 inspection at Elizabeth resulted in 483 Reports in response to which the Company submitted comprehensive corrective action plans to the FDA.  The Company has commenced implementation of these plans at both facilities.  The second 483 Report related to the Elizabeth facility confirmed the necessity to complete the corrective actions commenced upon receipt of the initial Report. The corrective action plans included product recalls of certain products produced in Baltimore, which were conducted in 2002, and product recalls of certain products produced in Elizabeth, which were conducted in 2003.  The costs of these recalls have already been incurred.  The Baltimore corrective action plan also includes a production slow-down, which commenced in 2002 and intensified in 2003.  The Company incurred costs of $3.2 million during 2002 and approximately an additional $18 million of outside consultant costs in 2003.  The estimated total external con
sultant costs of the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective actions is approximately $8 million for 2004, and the Company expects to spend less in the following years.  Additional internal costs, estimated at approximately $18 million in 2004 (primarily additional quality-related personnel), are being incurred and will continue in future years.  It is possible that these activities will necessitate additional expenditures in the future, although such costs cannot reasonably be estimated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FDA has not fully responded to the Company as to the adequacy of either of these plans or the recalls and slow-down action contained therein.  There can be no assurance that the ongoing implementation of the corrective action plans or the FDA's reaction to the status of these facilities will not require further actions at substantial additional costs, including additional product recalls or corrective actions that further restrict production from their current levels.  In addition, future recalls could result in significant costs to the Company, potential disruptions in the supply of the Company's products to its customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm the Company's ability to market its products.  Similarly, a recall of one of the Company's products or a product manufactured by another manufacturer could impair sales of other similar products the Company markets as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FDA compliance status of Baltimore and the Company's corrective action activities at this facility has had, and continues to have, an adverse impact on the Company's ability to launch products at this facility. The Company does not expect any new product approvals at its Baltimore facility in 2004. The Company's corrective action activities at its Elizabeth facility have had an adverse impact on the Company's ability to launch new products, however, the FDA has issued new product approvals at the Elizabeth facility during the later months of 2003.  However, there is a risk that the Company will not continue to receive new product approvals on a timely basis; as the Agency's view of the Elizabeth plant's compliance status can change from time to time based upon, among other factors, findings during on-site inspections by the FDA; including, without limitation the FDA's final view of the results of the second 2003 inspection and 483 Report which is not yet known to the Company </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product approval delays at any one of the Company's facilities will not necessarily have an effect on product approvals at its other facilities.  If the time necessary to achieve compliance is extended beyond what has been estimated in the Company's corrective action plans, the delay could be materially adverse to the Company.  (See the initial risk factor on the importance of new products.)  In addition to requiring remediation and withholding new product approvals, the FDA also has the authority to impose civil fines and to utilize equitable disgorgement in connection with the 483 Reports or the Baltimore consent decree, although the FDA has not taken any such action with respect to the Company. (See the immediately preceding risk factor, which deals with government regulations.)  Any such action would affect net income in the year imposed and, if such fines or disgorgement were of sufficient size, could have a material adverse affect on the Company's future operations.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An expansion of the ban of the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals could result in a decrease in the Company's total sales.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals.  While most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that the Company offers for sale, the European Union and five non-EU countries banned the use of bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic and growth promoter manufactured by the Company and others that has been used in livestock feeds for over 40 years, effective July 1, 1999.  The Company has not sold this product in these countries since the ban took effect.  The EU ban is based upon the "Precautionary Principle", which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by scientific certainty
.  Although the EU action negatively impacted the Company's business, it was not material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban in the EU will be expanded.  If either (a) the EU or countries within the EU act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based products, (b) there is an expansion of the zinc bacitracin ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products, (c) a similar ban is instituted relating to other antibiotic feed additives sold by the Company in the U.S. or in one or more other countries where the Company has material sales, or (d) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the Company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  The Company cannot predict whether this EU based antibiotic resistance concern will result in expanded regulations or public pressure adversely affecting other antibiotic-based anima
l health products manufactured by the Company or other countries in which those products are presently sold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions of the antibiotic resistance issue have recently become more active in the U.S.  Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse effects of the use of antibiotics in food animals.  Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company's customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics.  It is uncertain what actions, if any, the FDA may take in connection with drug resistant bacteria in animal health products.  However, the FDA has proposed a rating system to be used to compare the risks associated with the use of specific antibiotic products in food producing animals, including those sold by the Company.  While the Company does not believe that the presently proposed risk assessment system would be materially adverse to its business, it is subject to change prior to adoption or to later amendment.  The sales of the Company's Animal Health segment are principally antibiotic-based products f
or use in connection with food producing animals; therefore the future loss of major markets, including the U.S., or negative publicity regarding this use of antibiotic based products, could have a negative impact on the Company's sales and income.</P>

In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials or products or to lease or purchase new manufacturing facilities.  The Company may be unable to find a third party willing or able to provide the necessary products or facilities suitable for manufacturing pharmaceuticals on terms acceptable to the Company.  If the Company had to obtain substitute materials or products, the Company would require additional regulatory approvals, as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer.  The use of new facilities similarly would require regulatory
 approvals.  Any significant interruption of supply from the Company's suppliers or adverse event at any of its manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.  Seven raw materials used in Company products, which generate more than $5 million in annual revenues individually and $80 million in the aggregate, including Pentalong, a product sold in Germany, which contributes approximately $26.7 million in annual revenue, come from sole source suppliers.  While the Company relies on single source suppliers for many of its raw materials, it relies on different suppliers for different raw materials.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's foreign operations are subject to additional economic and political risks.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's foreign operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions, political instability in some countries, and uncertainty as to the enforceability of, and government control over, commercial rights.  The uncertainty related to the conflict with Iraq and continued terrorist threats could adversely affect the operations of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company sells products in many countries that are susceptible to significant foreign currency fluctuations.  The Company's API products are generally sold for U.S. dollars, eliminating the direct exposure to currency fluctuations, but increases credit risk if the local currency devalues significantly and it becomes more difficult for customers to purchase U.S. dollars required to pay the Company.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all the Company's businesses, it may become more difficult for the Company to respond to competitive challenges because of its size and product mix and the rapidly changing market.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The generic human pharmaceutical and animal pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and many of the Company's competitors in these areas are affiliated with entities which are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company possesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increased focus on pharmaceutical prices in Europe may lead to increased competition and price pressures for suppliers of all types of pharmaceuticals, including generics.  In addition, in certain countries, because of the Company's size and product mix, the Company may not be able to capitalize on such changes in competition and pricing as fully as the Company's competitors.  Additionally, in 2003 there were new entrants in the generic medicated animal feed additive market; particularly in the United States.  The Company's API business may be subject to additional competitive challenges; particularly with respect to those products with respect to which the Company implemented significant price increases during 2003.  In 2003; largely as a result of such price increases the Company's API operating income was $65.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to approximately $38.9 million for the same period in 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's branded drug business also may face competitive challenges from generic equivalents.  The Company has two patents for Kadian that are subject to potential paragraph IV challenges, though there have been no such challenges to date.  Upon entry of a generic equivalent in the market, the Company's branded products could lose substantial sales and the price per product unit could materially decline</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's Human Pharmaceutical business is affected by the reimbursement policies of third party payors, such as insurers and managed care organizations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's commercial success, in the U.S. and in foreign markets, with respect to generic products depends, in part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement for the Company's customers from third party health care payors, such as government and private health insurers and managed care organizations.  Third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services and their reimbursement practices may prevent the Company from maintaining the Company's present product price levels.  In addition, the market for the Company's products may be limited by third party payors who establish lists of approved products and do not provide reimbursement for products not listed.  In the U.S., Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's selling price on sales of certain prescription drugs reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs.  Certain U.S. states, such as Michigan and Fl
orida, have adopted measures to contain further the costs incurred for prescription drugs under their Medicaid programs.  These measures include placing certain prescription drugs on a restricted list and negotiating additional discounts in the prices paid for prescription drugs.  The Company is presently being sued by the State of Massachusetts alleging fraud in connection with these state Medicaid programs and has been notified by several additional states that it is the subject of investigations related to the same subject matter. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's policies regarding sales returns, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers and other customers, may reduce the Company's revenue in future fiscal periods.</B>  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Based on industry practice in the U.S., generic manufacturers such as the Company have liberal return policies and also provides customers certain post-sale inventory allowances, including credits for products in the customers' inventory to match post-sale decreases in the sales price for such products, chargebacks to wholesale customers in connection with sales they make to certain categories of customers such as hospitals or group purchasing organizations.  Although the Company establishes reserves based upon its prior experience and certain other information which constitute the Company's best estimate of the impact that these policies will have in subsequent periods, actual results could differ from these estimates.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's liability from accidents, product liability or other claims may exceed the Company's insurance coverage.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company seeks to obtain liability and direct damage insurance to protect it from the liability due to accidents, product liability and other claims that arise in the course of doing business.  Insurance that the Company seeks to obtain to protect itself against these potential liabilities may be inadequate, unobtainable or prohibitively expensive.  The Company is subject to renewal of most of its insurance policies each year and changes are anticipated at each renewal.  In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in its insurance costs and coverage reductions including coverage exclusions pertaining to certain products that it now manufactures or may manufacture in the future.  The Company's inability to obtain and maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company intends to pursue product-specific licensing, marketing agreements, co-development opportunities and other partnering arrangements in its Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health businesses.  The Company may also pursue selective acquisitions.  The Company cannot be sure that it will be able to locate suitable partners for these transactions.  In addition, assuming the Company identifies suitable partners, the process of effectively entering into these arrangements involves risks that the Company's management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns and that the Company may have difficulty integrating the new arrangements into its existing business.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company remains highly leveraged.  The Company's substantial indebtedness could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage or could adversely affect it's ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2003, the Company's total debt was $817.2 million and its total consolidated stockholders' equity was $1.132 billion.  The Company's stockholders' equity at that date reflected approximately $711.0 million of goodwill and approximately $347.7 million of intangibles.  The Company's operating income and EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement between the Company and Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions (the "2001 Credit Facility")) relative to its level of indebtedness and interest costs could restrict its operations.  In this regard, the Company notes that its earnings were not sufficient to cover its fixed charges in 2001 and 2002.  However, in 2003, the company's earnings were sufficient to cover its fixed charges.  Notwithstanding 2003, a continued inability to generate sufficient earnings to cover these charges could make it more difficult for the Company to make payments as required by its debt agreements, especially if the earnings de
ficiencies are the result of cash shortfalls.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

</DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Company may incur additional debt.  The Company's debt agreements permit the Company and its subsidiaries to incur substantial additional debt.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's foreign subsidiaries are expected to generate a significant amount of the cash that the Company needs to service its debt, but their ability to provide the Company with that cash could be restricted.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A substantial portion of the Company's operations is conducted by foreign subsidiaries, which accounted for $506.9 million and $588.7 of the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and which had $963.3 million of our total assets as of December 31, 2003.  Therefore, the Company's ability to service debt is dependent to a significant extent upon interest payments, cash dividends and distribution or other transfers from the Company's foreign subsidiaries to the Company.  In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to the Company could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdiction in which those foreign subsidiaries operate.  Moreover, payments to the Company by its foreign subsidiaries will be contingent upon th
eir earnings.  Under the Company's senior debt agreements, amounts earned which are not permitted to be distributed by the Company's foreign subsidiaries, whether by contract or otherwise, are not included in the Company's measure of EBITDA used to calculate compliance with the covenants in those instruments.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Servicing the Company's debt requires a significant amount of cash, and the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt depends on the Company's ability to generate cash flow.  The Company is required to make $25.4 million in principal payments and interest payments, estimated at over $58 million, in 2004.  The Company's ability to make this payment, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.  In addition, the Company's ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on its satisfaction of the financial covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility and other debt agreements.  The Company's business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to the Company under the 2001 Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash
, it may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity.  The Company may not be able to refinance any of its debt on favorable terms, or at all.  Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance the Company's debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's business has been affected by remediation and other issues that could hinder its ability to generate cash.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's financial results have been materially affected by the remediation and other issues that it has faced since 2001.  During the year ended December 31, 2002 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the Company has incurred costs of $3.2 million and $34.4 million, respectively, in connection with remediation at its Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.  If such costs were to increase, or if the Company's capacity was to be decreased, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Covenant restrictions under the Company's outstanding debt instruments may limit the Company's ability to operate its business.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's outstanding debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of the Company to finance future operations and capital needs and engage in certain other business activities.  For example, the 2001 Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  The Company is currently in compliance with each of these covenants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2002, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility to permit certain strategic initiatives, including plant closures and asset write-downs, and the prepayment of certain debt under the senior credit facilities without violating the covenants regarding "Consolidated EBITDA," the leverage, interest and fixed charge ratios, minimum net worth, asset sales, and prepayments of debt.  The amendment permitted the Company to add back $25 million related to these initiatives to its Consolidated EBITDA (an adjusted EBITDA measure defined in the 2001 Credit Facility) and to reduce its required net worth by the lesser of $75 million or the amount of these initiatives.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2003, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility in connection with the issuance of the Company's senior notes.  This amendment changed one of the financial covenants to refer to the senior secured leverage ratio instead of the senior leverage ratio, provided that for purposes of calculating the financial covenants the costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the senior notes would be excluded, permitted the issuance of the senior notes, amended the restricted payments covenant to permit interest payments on the senior notes, permitted a change in accounting for liquid and cream inventories in the U.S. from a last-in-first out method to a first-in-first-out method, and permitted the use of up to $2.5 million to repay certain debt securities.  In December 2003, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility to permit the Company to take certain of the actions described in the following paragraph without violating the covenants regarding Consolidated EBITDA, the 
incurrence of debt, changes in the nature of the Company's business, mergers, sales of assets, investments, prepayments of debt, and capital expenditures and to provide additional flexibility in the timing and application of the financial covenants, including the leverage ratios and net worth covenant.  The amendment permitted the Company to add back expenses and charges incurred in connection with these initiatives and cash restructuring charges up to $10 million to its Consolidated EBITDA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain financial covenants in the Company's senior credit facilities became increasingly restrictive in December 2003 and will become increasingly restrictive during 2005.  Continued compliance with these financial covenants depends on the Company's EBITDA, as defined the 2001 Credit Facility, and therefore on the Company's ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income, or on the Company's ability to reduce its outstanding debt.  Based upon its current earnings forecast, the Company expects to remain in compliance with its covenants under its senior credit facilities in 2004.  The Company is considering a number of options to ensure its continuing compliance with its covenants, including aggressive asset management, which includes working capital reduction programs and controls over capital expenditures, reducing operating costs, selling certain assets and reducing subordinated convertible debt through the issuance of common stock.  The Company cannot provide assur
ance that it will be successful in executing any of these actions or that its lenders will cooperate in amending the 2001 Credit Facility if necessary in the future in the event the Company requests changes to the 2001 Credit Facility in order to remain in compliance with any covenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial covenants, the 2001 Credit Facility has a number of non-financial provisions including a requirement that A. L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier") maintain control over sufficient shares the of the Company's Class B common stock to permit Industrier to elect a majority of the Company's Board of Directors.  The Company has no control over the actions of Industrier in this regard.  The 2001 Credit Facility also contains a requirement that the Company deliver unqualified audit reports from its independent accountants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility also requires that the Company reduce the outstanding principal amount of (i) its 5.75% Notes to $10.0 million or less by October 1, 2004 and (ii) its 3% Notes to $10.0 million or less by December 1, 2005.  In order to satisfy these obligations, the Company may need to issue additional shares of Class A common stock to the holders of the Notes, which would dilute the interests of the Company's current stockholders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $380.9 million of debt outstanding under the 2001 Credit Facility, which consisted of approximately $371.4 of term debt and $9.5 million of revolving debt.  While the Company is currently in compliance with the covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility, its performance and events beyond the Company's control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect its ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility.  The Company might not meet these covenants, and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet these covenants.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility and under the other debt agreements.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit Facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and 
payable.  The 2001 Credit Facility is also subject to termination in certain cases</P>

As of December 31, 2003, Industrier had 54.7% of the voting power of the Company's common stock.  Therefore, Industrier has significant influence and control over the Company's business and is presently entitled to elect two-thirds of the members of its board of directors.  Einar W. Sissener, Chairman of the board of directors of the Company, controls a majority of Industrier's outstanding shares and is Chairman of Industrier.  In addition, Mr. Sissener beneficially owns 373,667 shares of the Company's Class A common stock.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrier has the ability to make decisions affecting the Company's business and capital structure, including, in some instances, the issuance of additional indebtedness.  Industrier may pursue future transactions that could enhance its equity investment while involving risks to the interests of the Company.  All contractual arrangements between the Company and Industrier are subject to review by, or the ratification of, the Audit and Corporate Governance committee of the Company's board of directors as to the fairness of the terms and conditions of such arrangements to the Company.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Class Action Lawsuit</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  This class action has been brought on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company's securities between April 28, 1999 and October 30, 2000.  The Company is named as a defendant along with two of its board members, one of whom is an officer, and two of its former officers.  The class action complaint alleges that, among other things, the plaintiffs were damaged when they acquired the Company's securities because, as a result of (1) alleged irregularities in the Company's Animal Health business in Brazil, (2) allegedly improper revenue recognition practices and (3) the October 2000 revision of its financial results for 1999 and 2000, the Company's previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company's securities.  The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and R
ule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on legal grounds and the District Court granted its motion with prejudice as to all defendants.  The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court and the District Court affirmed its earlier dismissal.  The plaintiffs have appealed the Court's decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  All permitted briefs have been filed with the Third Circuit and oral argument was completed in 2003. The Company has vigorously defended this appeal.  Additionally, the Company has filed a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the named individual defendants under its directors' and officers' insurance policies and believes that insurance coverage exists to the extent of the policy limits for the costs incurred in defending the claims and any adverse judgment or settlement, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the relevant i
nsurance policy.  Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class action will result in liability which will be material to the Company's financial position.  However, it is not possible for the Company to conclude definitively that resolution of the lawsuit will not be material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or year in which it occurs.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
SEC Investigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements.  Deposition and document discovery is underway.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
FDA Facility Inspections</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Baltimore and Elizabeth, respectively.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from, primarily, cGMPs.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective-action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has not formally commented on the Company's corrective action plan.  The FDA performed another inspection of the Baltimore facility in February of 2004 and issued a 483 Report detailing plant deficiencies.  While the FDA has not indicated to the Company its position as to any of the items set forth on this February 2004 483 Report, the number and scope of the comments has declined significantly from the Report received in August 2002.   The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore plant in 
accordance with the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the redemptive actions by the end of 2004.  As part of the corrective action plan, product recalls were conducted in 2002 and production at the Baltimore facility was reduced in several increments during 2002 and 2003.  This reduction in production has had an effect on earnings and the possibility of an adverse effect in 2004 was incorporated into the Company budgeting process.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between November, 2002 and January, 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA on January 15, 2003.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response on February 5, 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The Company originally anticipated completion of these actions on or about the end of 2003.  However, the FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued a 483 Report alleging continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations. As a result the Company now anticipates completion of a significant portion of its corrective actions in mid 2004, the remainder by March 2005.  Certain product recalls were included in the original corrective action plan which were completed in 2002 and 2003.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company incurred costs of $3.2 million during 2002 and approximately an additional $18 million of outside consultant costs in 2003.  The estimated total external consultant costs of the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective actions is approximately $8.0 million for 2004.  In addition, the Company has added significant internal personnel (largely quality and laboratory personnel), estimated at approximately $18 million in 2004 at both Elizabeth and Baltimore.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost and timing of both the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective action plans may change based upon the FDA responses which have not yet been received and other factors.  (See "Risk Factors".)</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Gabapentin</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDAs filed under paragraph IV for gabapentin capsules and tablets, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998 with respect to capsules and on December 12, 1999 with respect to tablets, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and the FDA that its proposed generic gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.  In the litigation concerning the Company's gabapentin capsules, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the two patents, which was subsequently denied.  The Com
pany filed in the tablet litigation, and renewed in the capsule litigation, the Company's motion of summary judgment of non-infringement on Pfizer's patents.  These motions have been decided in the Company's favor by the District Court.   &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the lawsuits regarding gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels.  After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under paragraph IV that the Company's proposed gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable.  In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this patent.  The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent.  This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three gabapentin cases have been consolidated for trial, but no trial date has been set.  Unless and until the Company decides to utilize such authorization to market its gabapentin tablets or capsules, the Company would, in the event of an adverse decision, at most, only be liable to Pfizer for its legal costs and not any monetary damages.  To date, the Company has not marketed these pharmaceuticals.  There is the possibility that as a result of this litigation, the Company could be prevented from marketing the Company's gabapentin capsules or tablets until Pfizer's patents expire. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that it has secured eligibility for 180 day market exclusivity on gabapentin 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules.  Exclusivity for this product will be triggered by the earlier of either Purepac's commercial marketing of gabapentin or a court decision that finds the relevant Pfizer patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  On February 14, 2003, Torpharm, a competitor that has filed an ANDA for gabapentin capsules, filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA.  Both this District Court and a federal appellate court upheld the FDA award to the Company.  The Company can give no assurance that it will ultimately benefit from an exclusivity period.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the launch of gabapentin, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (the "GAPI") of gabapentin under which the Company has acquired GAPI inventory.  The terms of the Company's agreement with the GAPI supplier will require the payment to the supplier of a portion of the Company's net sales of finished dose gabapentin product during any period of exclusivity ("Net Sales Split").  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had paid approximately $12,500 in partial payment of GAPI inventory.  The Company will make additional payments of approximately $22,800 and $10,500 in 2004 and 2005, respectively, for GAPI inventory received and ordered. All of these payments reduce the Net Sales Split on a dollar for dollar basis.  Other than outstanding purchase orders for GAPI to be received subsequent to year-end, the Company has no additional obligation to purchase additio
nal GAPI inventory.  The Company cannot predict the outcome of the gabapentin litigation; however, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, or other factors preventing the Company from selling the finished product, the Company will reassess the net realizable value of the GAPI, and may incur a charge to write-down GAPI to its net realizable value and record any required payments under the supply agreement.  The maximum charge could be approximately $46,000 based on GAPI currently on hand or ordered.  In addition, the Company is negotiating certain changes in the arrangement with its GAPI supplier which, if unsuccessful, could require the Company to make a $3,000 payment to the GAPI supplier.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is one of multiple defendants in a lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General alleging Medicaid fraud in connection with the manner the Company utilizes to establish the "average wholesale price" for its various drugs.  In addition four other state Attorneys General have given the Company notice that said agencies are investigating what appear to be similar claims.  The Company believes that the manner in which it establishes its "average wholesale prices" is reasonable and proper and furthermore that it practices in this regard are generally similar to those used by others in the pharmaceutical industry.  </P>

</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Trade Commission is undertaking a formal investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding a 1998 agreement with Perrigo Inc. under which the Company (i) renunciated its Waxman-Hatch 180-day marketing exclusivity for a certain product and (ii) granted a license under a patent related to the product in return for royalty payments form Perrigo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product Liability Matter</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has been named in a lawsuit which alleges that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce litter that contains a high level of arsenic.  The suit further alleges that this litter, when used as agricultural fertilizer by the chicken farmer, causes cancer in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields).  In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the plaintiff's, there is the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in the lawsuit.  The plaintiff's are also requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue.  The Company has not had the opportunity to participate in any discovery to form a view on the plaintiff's allegations.  Sales of this product were approximately $24 million in 2003.  </P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business.  It is the view of management, after consultation with counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all other pending suits should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals. The Company offers a comprehensive range of generic human pharmaceutical products in over 800 tablet, capsule, liquid and topical formulations and dosage forms. In addition, the Company manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API's") that are used primarily by third parities in the manufacturing of generic and branded products. It also manufacturers and markets animal health products in over 100 formulations and dosage forms. The Company conducts business in more than 60 countries and has approximately 4,700 employees at 40 sites, in 27 countries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Human Pharmaceutical business is composed of USHP, API and IG. The USHP includes a generic business and a branded product line consisting of two products. IG is an international generic business primarily in Europe with subsidiaries in Indonesia and China. The API is a worldwide business which manufactures and sells a range of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients which are used by third parties in the production of finished pharmaceutical products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factors affecting the Human Pharmaceutical business are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic pharmaceutical markets in the US and internationally are extremely competitive and/or regulated by governments which exerts downward pressure on prices.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation can also influence demand for products and profitability. &nbsp;Legislation was effective in Germany on January 1, 2004, which increased the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Rebate from 6% to 16%. In addition, the co-payments required by patients increased as of January 1, 2004. The impact of the increased rebate will be to lower annual gross profits by approximately $2.5 million. The increase in co-payments increased demand for certain products in the fourth quarter of 2003 as certain patients bought their prescriptions prior to the increase in the required co-payment. The increase in fourth quarter demand will be offset by a likely decrease in first quarter 2004 demand.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with FDA and comparable international agencies' regulations and guidelines is of paramount importance. Significant costs are incurred and opportunities are lost if corrective action efforts in product manufacture are required. The Company has been negatively affected by corrective action costs in 2003 and 2002. The Company will continue to spend significant amounts, both internal and external, on corrective actions in 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branded and API products offer profitable growth opportunities as uniqueness and marketing efforts can maintain or increase pricing and increase demand.  Strong profitability and growth opportunities also can encourage additional competition. Pricing was increased substantially on certain API products in 2003. Branded sales volume increased over 60% in 2003 as a result of marketing efforts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Animal Health business is a global leader in the development, registration, manufacturing and marketing of medicated feed additives for food producing animals including poultry, cattle, swine and farmed fish.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factors affecting the Animal Health business are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural markets have historically had low growth rates. In addition, demand for company products has been and could continue to be reduced by bans on the use of antibiotics and animal diseases such as "mad cow" disease and Asian bird flu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importation of MFA's from low cost countries such as India and China has increased competition and lowered pricing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company business segments also have significant intangible assets and goodwill which require impairment testing and possible write downs based on triggering events which indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable (e.g. increased competition, changes in future plans).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's operations as a whole have been affected by the debt incurred through 2001 to make a number of acquisitions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing in late 2001 and continuing through 2003, Alpharma focused on de-leveraging its balance sheet by converting $212 million of the Company's convertible notes into common stock and reducing additional indebtedness with free cash flow generated through operational efficiencies in the use of working capital and by reducing capital expenditures. 2001 and 2000 were years which included a number of significant transactions which the Company entered into as part of or to finance, its previous acquisition program. No acquisitions were planned or completed during 2002 and 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in 2001 through 2003, the Company incurred significant charges for reorganization, refocus and de-leveraging which were intended to improve future operations and reduce debt and recognize asset impairments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $28.4 million related to the extinguishment of senior subordinated notes, the sale of its French operation which was classified as a discontinued operation and incurred a $8.7 million pre-tax charge, in connection with an employee reduction program.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company incurred pre-tax charges and write-downs of $219.8 million including significant charges and expenses related to the required acquisition accounting for OPB (pre-tax $5.4 million), de-leveraging activities (pre-tax $52.9 million), severance charges and asset write-downs related to reorganization and refocus of the organization (pre-tax $53.4 million) and the impairment of assets and goodwill, (pre-tax $115.1 million) primarily in the Animal Health segment. (See "Identified Transactions, 2002".)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the Company incurred pre-tax charges and write-downs of $83.8 million, including charges and expenses related to the acquisition and financing of OPB (pre-tax $61.9 million) de-leveraging activities (pre-tax of $8.9 million) the combination of OPB and USPD to form USHP, the combination of management for IG and API, management actions in the Animal Health segment and other unusual items (together, pre-tax $13.0 million).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter, the Company prepaid $35.0 million of the 2001 credit facility's term loans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second quarter of 2003, the Company sold $220.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011. The proceeds of the offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were $197.0 million. These proceeds, together with funds available from other sources, were used to repay existing 12.5% Senior Subordinated Notes. The fees paid to the initial purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes of $22.2 million were made pursuant to arrangements originally entered into in December 2001. The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of the existing Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result, both the fees of $22.2 million paid in April 2003 and the unamortized loan costs of $6.2 million associated with the Senior Subordinated Notes, were expensed in the second quarter 2003. The effective tax rate in 2003 was 6.5% due primarily to the tax benefit associated with the expensing of the debt placement fees and unamortized loan costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2003, the Company closed the sale of its French subsidiary, Alpharma SAS ("SAS") for approximately $6.0 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.0 million. The operations of SAS have been reclassified as a discontinued operation. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this presentation. All comparisons of results of operations refer to continuing operations and reflect the elimination of SAS.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2003 the Company had a program to reduce its workforce which resulted in a charge of $8.7 million and the severing of approximately 175 employees.  Additionally, the Company amended its 2001 credit facility to allow for certain asset sales, permit exclusions for restructuring (including the fourth quarter severance) and refinancing charges from EBITDA and amended certain leverage ratios to delay the timing of further covenant restrictions.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March, the Company prepaid $35.0 million of senior debt and recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt (pre-tax $.7 million). In addition, the Company issued 6.7 million new shares in exchange for $110 million of outstanding convertible notes and recorded a non-cash expense of $48.0 million pretax and $29.3 million after tax ($.60 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter, the Company determined that certain tangible and intangible assets related to an Animal Health product, Reporcin, were impaired and recorded a pre-tax charge of $37.1 million and $24.2 million after tax ($.47 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, the Company instituted certain management reorganizations and reductions in force and recorded charges for severance of approximately $6.8 million ($.09 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter, the Company amended the senior loan agreement to include covenant relief for certain fourth quarter charges for plant closings and impairments primarily in the Animal Health business. The fourth quarter charges were approximately $119.6 million pre-tax ($1.51 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the amendment reduced the revolving credit commitment by $150.0 million. The Company repaid term debt of $50.0 million in the fourth quarter which resulted in a charge of $1.0 million pre-tax ($.01 per share). The reduction and repayment resulted in a write-off of deferred debt expense of $3.2 million ($.04 per share).  </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in-process research and development.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OPB acquisition was ultimately funded by a $900.0 million Bank Credit Agreement ("2001 Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks and a $200.0 million senior subordinated note. Proceeds from the 2001 Credit Agreement were used to repay the prior Bank Credit Agreement. Bridge financing and other bank fees and the repayment of the prior Bank Credit Agreement resulted in additional expenses of approximately $3.3 million in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent with the OPB Acquisition, the Company's USPD was combined with the U.S. operations of OPB to form the U.S. Human Pharmaceutical Segment. The combination resulted in approximately $4.8 million in severance charges in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, the Company announced the combination of management for IG, API and OPB-China. The combination resulted in charges of approximately $4.3 million primarily for severance.</P>

<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, the Company's Animal Health Segment announced changes in business practices and a change in existing management. These changes resulted in severance of approximately $1.1 million, charges relating to the exiting of a product line of $11.2 million, and lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2001.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Revenues</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in USHP increased $16.8 million (3.3%) due primarily to the branded product (Kadian).  Branded sales (primarily Kadian) were $64.8 million in the year 2003 compared to $39.1 million in 2002. Sales of generic products declined 2% due primarily to liquid dose volume declines for the entire year due to Baltimore corrective actions and lower volumes of oral solids partially related to modified release capacity constraints at the solid dose plant in the second quarter of 2003. Revenues of generic products include approximately $9.1 million earned as a result of a profit sharing agreement on the launch of Metformin ER in the fourth quarter of 2003. Such income is recorded as revenues for USHP management reporting purposes but is reclassified as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the agreement, Alpharma and Ivax agreed to share profits during the 180 day exclusivity period. In return, Alpharma withdrew a lawsuit which challenged Ivax first to
 file status on Metformin ER. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories of generic products at certain wholesale customers generally range from 2-6 months for all products, with a majority at the lower end of the range. One major wholesale customer typically holds up to 5 months of inventory for certain products. Kadian inventory at certain wholesale customers is estimated to be approximately 4-5 months based on expected demand. These inventory levels have remained consistent. However, in the event that customers reduce inventory levels in the future, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IG increased $48.2 million (15.1%) due primarily to translation of sales made in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar (14.1%). The remaining revenue increase of approximately 1.0% was attributable to higher volume of products (6%) which was substantially offset by price declines (5%), mainly in the United Kingdom and Nordic markets. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in API increased $40.9 million (49%) due primarily to price increases in selected products (46%). Foreign currency translation also increased API revenues by approximately 5%. Aggregate volume of all API products was approximately 2% lower.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal Health revenues declined $26.2 million (8.1%) due to volume declines (6%) and price reductions (5%) due to competition, primarily in swine and cattle markets.  Foreign currency translation positively impacted Animal Health revenues by 3%.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Gross Profit</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Company-wide basis gross profit decreased $8.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002. As a percentage of sales, overall gross profit was 39.9% in 2003, versus 42.7% in 2002. Included in 2002 is a reduction in margin of $5.3 million due to purchase accounting adjustments for the OPB and $1.4 million related to the AH product impairment. Included in 2003 are inventory write-offs of approximately $7.2 million for discontinued liquid products and approximately $18 million of outside consulting expenses resulting from the corrective action plan at the USHP plants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's corrective action plan for the Baltimore plant, provided in response to the FDA inspection observation ("Form 483") was submitted to the FDA in October 2002. In 2003, approximately $21.0 million (of which $12.9 million was for external resources) was spent on corrective actions. In January 2004 the FDA re-inspected Baltimore and issued a Form 483 with significantly less observations than in the 2002 inspection. The corrective action plan in Baltimore will require additional compliance expenditures in 2004 of approximately $5.3 million. The Company expects to be substantially complete with the Baltimore corrective action plan by the end of 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's corrective action plan for the Elizabeth plant provided in response to a Form 483 received in January 2003 required expenditures of $13.3 million (of which $5.2 million was for external resources). In December 2003, the FDA issued a Form 483 and the Company has responded with a plan which will require approximately $2.0 million of external expenditures. The corrective actions are expected to be substantially complete by mid 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in gross margin dollars results primarily from price increases in API, higher USHP brand revenues, and positive currency effects in IG, partially offset by volume reductions, inventory write-offs and corrective action costs incurred by USHP and lower IG and AH pricing.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a consolidated basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $18.5 million (6%) in 2003 as compared to 2002.  The increase is primarily attributable to translation of foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar.  In addition, other increases include higher USHP marketing costs for branded products, and increased corporate costs for professional fees and consulting. 2003 includes the reduction of AH operating expenses by $2.7 million for a business interruption insurance recovery. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Research and Development Expense ("R&amp;D")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses decreased $3.9 million in 2003 due to the timing of clinical studies, mainly by USHP and planned reductions by AH. Remediation efforts by USHP personnel has also lowered R&amp;D by shifting resources to corrective actions. </P>

API operating income increased primarily due to price increases. USHP declined due to increased compliance costs and lower generic sales offset partially by increased brand volume, profit sharing income, and to a lesser extent, pricing.   Excluding charges in 2002, AH decreased primarily due to lower pricing. Unallocated includes corporate expenses for administration, finance, legal and certain unallocated expenses primarily related to the implementation of a company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System and increased due to higher professional fees and increased amortization of ERP expenses.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs decreased $12.6 million to $63.6 million in 2003 due to decreased debt levels and lower interest rates versus a year ago.  The issuance of 8 5/8% Senior Notes replacing the 12 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes in April 2003 has contributed to lower interest expense.  Amortization of debt issuance costs was approximately $3.9 million and $4.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The write-off of $6.2 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the 8 5/8% Notes contributed to the reduction in amortization. </P>

<B><P>Loss on extinguishment of debt</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss on extinguishment of debt was $29.1 million in 2003 compared to $52.9 million in 2002. The 2003 loss resulted from the extinguishment of $200 million 12 1/2% notes and the related issuance of $220 million of 8 5/8% notes. The extinguishment resulted in the expensing of $22.2 million in placement fees and $6.2 million of deferred debt expense. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002 the Company incurred approximately $52.9 million of expense for two exchanges of common stock for $110 million of convertible debt and write-off of deferred debt expense due to reductions of credit lines and repayment of debt. (See de-leveraging activities included in 2002 identified transactions.)</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Tax Provision</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax provision in 2003 was a benefit of $0.2 million compared to pre-tax income of $19.3 million. The effective tax rate of 1.0% results mainly from the tax benefit on the $28.4 million expense from debt extinguishment at the incremental U.S. federal and state rate of approximately 39% while using an approximate 24% effective rate for all other income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has recorded certain U.S. deferred tax assets for which it has provided no valuation allowances. These U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as any newly generated deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  If it were considered to be more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets would not be realized, a valuation allowance would be established against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company's assessment of its net U.S. deferred tax assets of $25.9 million at December 31, 2003, based upon certain available tax planning strategies, the Company considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, no valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2003. Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized, a valuation allowance would be required and the Company's operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such determination would be made.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Results of Continuing Operations 2002 vs. 2001</B> (all earnings per share amounts are diluted)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most comparisons of 2002 consolidated results are affected by the Company's acquisition in December of 2001 of the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals business ("OPB acquisition") and the financing required to complete the acquisition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparisons of 2002 consolidated results are also affected by the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS 142") effective January 1, 2002 which states that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization, but will be subject to periodic testing for impairment. The full year of 2001 includes approximately $18.3 million of goodwill amortization expense which was not included in 2002 (approximately $.36 per share diluted for the year).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue increased $261 million (27.0%) to $1,230.8 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the OPB acquisition, which increased revenue by $261.2 million (26.9%). The Company reported an operating loss of ($24.2) million compared to operating income of $26.0 million in 2001 due primarily to asset impairment and other charges of $155.1 million, offset by net increases in operating income from operations and various other factors described in operating income (loss) below. The Company recorded a net loss of $99.7 million ($2.00 per share) in 2002 compared to a net loss of $37.7 million ($.92 per share) in 2001.  Net losses in 2002 and 2001 also include significant charges for exchanges of common stock for debt and other debt reductions.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IG increased 11.5%, excluding both $17.4 million increase due to translation of currencies into the U.S. dollar and $15.3 million due to the inclusion of OPB China. The organic growth in IG revenues resulted from volume increases, (approximately 23% in total), in the UK and other markets for base and new products (including Omeprazole in the UK) offset partially by price declines, (approximately 11% in total), primarily in the UK. Pricing in the UK is below 2001 levels and remains highly competitive. In 2002, legislation was adopted in Germany which also had the effect of lowering pricing.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in API increased 12.4% compared to 2001 primarily due to volume increases in Vancomycin and Amphotericin.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in USHP increased due to the inclusion of the OPB - U.S. ($245.9 million), which was acquired in December 2001. Revenues in the liquid and topical business declined due to the recall of two products in the first quarter and the effects of regulatory compliance activities at the Baltimore plant. Certain wholesale customers have levels of inventory that generally range from 2 - 6 months for all products, with a majority at the lower end of the range. One major wholesaler customer typically holds up to 5 months inventory for certain products. These inventory levels have remained consistent, however, in the event that customers reduce inventory levels in the future, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted. Revenues will also be adversely impacted in future quarters by the FDA regulatory compliance activities at the Baltimore and Elizabeth plant. (See Gross Profit below and Note 18.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH revenues declined modestly overall for the year. However, both year's results were impacted by special circumstances. Revenues for the first six months of 2001 totaled $201.4 million and included approximately $38.0 million in revenue related to the financial statement revision which modified the timing of revenue recognition from the time an order was segregated in a third party warehouse and billed, to when the order was delivered. The second six months of 2001 revenues totaled $133.9 million and reflected a change in business practices which reduced the use of certain sales incentives and extended payment terms. The first six months of 2002 revenues were $149.0 million which reflect the lowering of inventories in the distribution system and market acceptance of payment terms of net 30 days. The second half of 2002 revenues were $172.9 million.  Generally, there is a seasonal increase in this business during the second half of the year.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a company-wide basis, gross profit increased $147.4 million, and as a percentage of sales, overall gross profit was 42.7% in 2002, compared to 39.0% in 2001. The increase in gross profit reflects increases for the inclusion of OPB and volume increases in IG's UK business being offset partially by lower pricing in IG, and volume declines in the liquids business of USHP. USHP gross margins were negatively impacted by the production slowdowns related to the first quarter 2002 product recalls and other corrective actions in response to the FDA inspection at its Baltimore plant.</P>

<B>Selling, General and Administrative Expense ("SGA")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a consolidated basis, SGA expense increased $72.1 million and approximately $90.4 million excluding the effect of goodwill amortization. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of OPB operations, increased expenses related to the implementation of a company wide Enterprise Resource Planning system (a "ERP system") (primarily included in unallocated), increased personnel costs including accruals for incentive compensation in 2002 and higher insurance costs. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating income decreased by $50.2 million and resulted in a loss in 2002 of $24.2 million. Comparison of 2002 to 2001 is complicated by the cessation of amortization for goodwill in 2002, the financial statement revision and identified transactions in both years. (See "Identified Transactions, 2002" and "Identified Transactions, 2001".) The following represents a bridge between 2001 and 2002.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IG's net margin improvement is due to increased volume in a number of markets, offset by lower pricing. API's net margin improvement is due primarily to increased volume in Vancomycin and Amphotericin. USHP's improvement is due to the OPB acquisition offset by lower volume in liquids due to regulatory compliance activities. AH's improvement is due to volume increases in the second half of 2002 relative to 2001. Corporate and unallocated expenses increased due to expenses related to the implementation of a company-wide ERP system, including amortization of capitalized costs commencing in April 2002, and increased personnel costs, including incentive compensation, as management personnel were changed and positions were added.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense was $76.2 million in 2002 compared to $51.5 million in 2001. The increase results from debt incurred to finance the OPB acquisition which was partially offset by debt paydowns from free cash flow, lower interest rates in 2002 and reduced interest expenses on convertible notes which were exchanged for common stock in March 2002.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A discussion of the identified transactions follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPI, primarily within the IG segment, incurred asset impairment and other charges of approximately $8.1 million consisting of severance charges of approximately $1.7 million and impairment losses of $6.4 million relating to product lines in Germany which, as part of the 2003 plan process, were determined to be impaired and were written down.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USHP incurred charges of approximately $5.4 million in connection with the OPB acquisition on December 12, 2001, which in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001 and the remaining balance of $5.4 million as the inventory was sold in the first quarter of 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH incurred charges of approximately $152.1 million in 2002 in connection with changes in response to and in anticipation of major challenges in the marketplace and in the way the business will be managed in the future. The AH business, which is in low or no growth competitive markets, will be repositioned to enhance working capital management and cash flow. AH management was changed; there were reductions in workforce at closed plant sites; and positions were eliminated in a number of functions, resulting in severance charges of approximately $3.8 million. AH announced the closing of four facilities which resulted in write-downs and exit costs of $45.2 million (consisting of $40.2 million of asset impairments and $5.0 million of cost of sales). AH announced an impairment charge of $37.1 million (including $1.4 million of cost of sales) for certain tangible and intangible assets related to an AH product, Reporcin. New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure
 resulted in lower forecasted cash flows and a change in strategy to cash generation from growth through new products and technologies and through international market expansion. The lower forecasted cash flows triggered an impairment of all AH goodwill totaling $66.0 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate includes severance charges for management reorganization of $1.3 million, $51.1 million of charges related to the exchange of convertible debt in the first quarter of 2002, ($48.0 million), write-off of deferred loan costs due to the reduction of the credit line by $150 million ($3.2 million), and charges resulting from the early extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million.</P>

<P>A discussion of each of these 2001 identified transactions follows.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>OPB Acquisition</P>
</B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</U>OPB Financing</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2001, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the OPB of Faulding Limited from Mayne Nickless Limited ("Mayne") subject to Mayne's completion of a tender offer for Faulding. The Company was required to make a $145.0 million escrow deposit in July. In October, the Company obtained management control of OPB, subject to certain limitations. In October, to fund the $660.0 million purchase price to Mayne, the Company released the $145.0 million escrow, paid an additional $255.0 million and provided a $260.0 million letter of credit. In December the acquisition closed and the letter of credit was funded. The OPB is included in the Company's results from December&nbsp;12, 2001, the date of acquisition. The identified transactions include the interest expense and letter of credit fees related to the prepayments during the July-December period of $8.4 million and a charge of $2.3 million included in other, net for bank fees primarily for the bridge financing
, net of interest income on the escrow deposit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new financing required for the OPB resulted in the repayment and termination of the 1999 Credit Facility. The write-off of the bank fees related to the early extinguishment of debt of $2.2 million is also included with the identified transactions.</P>
<U>
</U><P>Purchase Accounting</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&amp;D"). IPR&amp;D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&amp;D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&amp;D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced f
or a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Combination of OPB with USPD and Other Acquisition Expenses</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon acquisition, the OPB was combined with the USPD to create U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals. The combination resulted in severance charges of $4.8 million related to USPD employees. In addition, the IG business commenced the closure of its Copenhagen Research Facility resulting in severance of approximately $1.5 million. The Company intends to conduct its oral solid research at the OPB facilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2001, the Company incurred acquisition expenses for professional and consulting services of $3.3 million related to the OPB.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the transactions identified with the OPB acquisition resulted in a net loss of $52.4 million or $1.28 per share.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>De-leveraging Activities</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company significantly increased its debt in connection with the OPB acquisition. The credit facilities entered into in connection with the acquisition of OPB and the refinancing of existing debt contain various financial covenants, operating restrictions and require the repayment of debt on a scheduled basis. The Company is in compliance with all of the terms of the credit facilities and believes it will be able to comply in the future. In order to ensure compliance and increase flexibility under the agreements, the Company intends to continue to de-leverage. Toward this goal, the Company has adopted a comprehensive de-leveraging plan, which includes aggressive expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets. The Company has continued to pursue these alternatives to further reduce debt.  (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for 2002 de-leveraging activities).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, the Company exchanged $34.1 million of 5.75% subordinated debentures for approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock and recorded a non-cash expense of $7.4 million. Additionally, in December 2001, the Company repaid term loans of $65.0 million and recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million.  The sum of these 2001 de-leveraging activities resulted in a loss of approximately $6.8 million ($.17 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Reorganization, Refocus and Other Transactions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Animal Health</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2001, the Company changed management in its Animal Health business. The change in management resulted in severance charges of $1.1 million. New management began a review of current projects and decided to discontinue support of certain projects including the commercialization of the Optibreed product. This decision resulted in a charge for disposal of Optibreed inventory of $8.7 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
HPI</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of IG and API resulted in severance charges of $2.8 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Other Items</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other identified transactions, which net to $0.4 million of expense include income of $2.1 million from the settlement of vitamin litigation in the Animal Health business in the second quarter 2001 offset by the write-off of investments of $2.5 million including an equity position in the company which manufactured the Optibreed product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of the reorganization, refocus and other transactions is a loss, net of taxes, of $7.9 million ($.19 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Inflation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of inflation on the Company's operations during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was not significant.</P>

<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. All professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 2003, have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  The Company has chosen to highlight certain policies that it considers critical to the operations of the business and understanding its consolidated financial statements:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Revenue Recognition</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment.  Certain subsidiaries have terms FOB destination where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery.  In the case of FOB destination, revenue is not recognized until products are received by the customer.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Company's US Human Pharmaceutical business, and to a lesser extent in Human Pharmaceuticals - International, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, price adjustments, discounts, promotional allowances, profit sharing, or other managed-care allowances.  Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for these discounts are reflected in the Statement of Operations as a reduction of net sales.  There were no material changes in estimates associated with aggregate provisions in 2003, 2002 and 2001.  Accruals are reflected on the balance sheet with the reserve balances associated with these deductions from revenue classified either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable or, to the extent that they are due to entities other than customers, as accrued expenses.  The reserve balances relative to these provisions included in "Accounts receivable, net" and Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $64.7 million and $82.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $65.9 million and $73.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002.  The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these deductions from revenue by comparison of estimated amounts to actual experience."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in USHP for rebates, chargebacks, discounts, promotional and Medicaid allowances and other credits are considered by the Company as different means to reflect price reductions to customers, both direct and indirect.  The accrual balances for price reductions at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $107.2 million and $105.2 million, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in USHP for floorstock price adjustments, product returns and profit sharing are generally considered by the Company as reflecting costs of maintaining favorable competitive relationships with the customer.  The accrual balances for customer relationships were $22.5 million and $19.4 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in International subsidiaries for rebates, chargebacks, returns and other discounts are more diverse and vary by location.  In total, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 accrual balances were $17.4 million and $14.5 million, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for rebates, discounts, promotional allowances, profit sharing, managed care allowances and other credits are made at the time of sale and are estimated primarily based on contract terms and historical relationship to revenues. Such provisions are determinable due to definitive contract terms and general consistency of historical experience. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for chargebacks, price adjustments and returns require management to make more subjective judgments.  These provisions are discussed below. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chargebacks - The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.  The Company markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations.  The Company also markets products indirectly to chain pharmacies, independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies, collectively referred to as "indirect customers."  The Company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products.  The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices.  Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers which establish contract pricing for certain products that the wholesalers provide.  Under either arrangement, the Company will provide credit to
 the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler's invoice price.  Such credit is called a chargeback, and the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler's invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate.  The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.  The information regarding inventory levels within the distribution channel is derived from inventory management reports purchased from major wholesale customers.  The Company continually monitors its provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it is believed that actual chargeback rates differ from chargeback rates used to establish reserves.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price Adjustments - Price adjustments, which include shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the Company's products.  Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction.  Decreases in the Company's selling prices are discretionary decisions made to reflect current market conditions.  Amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, estimated declines in market price, and, in the case of shelf stock adjustments, estimates of inventory held by the customer.  The Company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates its reserves and estimates as additional information becomes available.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns - Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a returns policy that allows its customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, six months before and twelve months after product expiration.).  The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns.  Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over the counter products, to name a few, and makes adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from established reserves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B>Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has completed several acquisitions since 1998, which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization.  The values assigned to goodwill and intangibles, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by the Company.  In addition, in 2002, upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and reviewed goodwill upon transition and at each year-end for impairment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations. These allocations, including an assessment of estimated useful lives, have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies. Valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset, including historical cash flows.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>Asset Impairments</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a dimunition in value may have occurred, based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset. If the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.  Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the Company, including the determination of an event indicating impairment; the future cash flows to be generated by the asset, including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action; the risk associated with those cash flows; and the Company's cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized. In the case of asset or business divestitures the difficulty of assessing a potential impairment is intensified. The sale of a business or asset is not assured regardless of the intention of the company until an unrelated third party and the Company reach a mutually acceptable agreement. While both parties can genuinely want an agreement, no divestiture is probable until a final agreement has been negotiated and signed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has certain assets not presently fully utilized for production which are expected to be operational in 2005. These under utilized or idle assets also require judgment in determining their probable future cash flows. Presently the value is expected to be recovered. If plans for use materially change an impairment charge could be required.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Research and Development ("R&amp;D"), Including In-Process R&amp;D ("IPR&amp;D")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to completed acquisitions, acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility, signified by FDA or comparable regulatory body approval, are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits.   Estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&amp;D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B>Inventories</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventories determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation. The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employee Benefit Plans</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirement, post-employment and health care benefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates, and health care cost and trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Litigation and Contingencies</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and also to certain other contingencies (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the financial statements).  The Company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred. Additionally, the Company assesses, in consultation with its counsel, the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis.  Reserves are recorded when the Company, in consultation with counsel, determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income Taxes</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset.  In the event the Company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is recorded.  The Company's valuation allowance principally relates to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has recorded certain U.S. deferred tax assets for which it has provided no valuation allowances. These U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as any newly generated deferred tax assets, are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. If it were considered to be more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets would not be realized, a valuation allowance would be established against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company's assessment of its net U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $26 million at December 31, 2003, based upon certain available tax planning strategies, the Company considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, no valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2003. Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized, a valuation allowance would be required and the Company's operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such determination would be made.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is considering a number of asset divestitures. It is possible that certain divestitures will result in a loss for tax and book purposes. Depending on the jurisdiction in which the loss occurs and the size of the loss it is possible that certain potential losses will require a valuation allowance for a portion of all of the deferred tax benefit recorded.</P>

</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2003, stockholders' equity was $1,132.0 million compared to $1,001.8 million and $889.8 million at December&nbsp;31, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The ratio of long-term debt to equity was .69:1, .85:1 and 1.16:1 at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in Stockholders' Equity in 2003 results primarily from the translation of foreign currencies into the US Dollar.  At December 31, 2002, the Company had an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $20.1 million. At December 31, 2003, due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many other currencies, the Company has other comprehensive income of $95.8 million. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2002 mainly represents the exchanges of convertible notes to equity and miscellaneous equity issuances totaling $142.7 million and $78.3 million of other comprehensive income primarily due to a positive currency translation adjustment refl
ecting the weakening in 2002 of the U.S. dollar, offset by a net loss of $99.7 million, and dividends of $9.2 million. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2001 represents equity issuances primarily due to exchanges of convertible debentures for common stock offset by the 2001 net loss and a negative currency translation adjustment. In 2001, long-term debt increased to finance the OPB acquisition. In 2002, the Company reduced long-term debt by approximately $181.0 million due to exchange of convertible debentures for equity and repayment of $86.0 million of long-term debt, principally with funds from operating cash flow. In 2003 long-term debt was reduced by $65.0 million due to repayments from operating cash flow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital at December 31, 2003, was $334.7 million compared to $292.8 million and $317.5 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. The current ratio was 1.93:1 at December&nbsp;31, 2003 compared to 1.77:1 and 1.92:1 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $13.8 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002.  Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&amp;D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the
 convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges.  In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002.  This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business.  Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide.  This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection.  The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline.  The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance sheet amounts increased as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 2002 in U.S. Dollars as the functional currencies of the Company's principal foreign subsidiaries, the Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone, the Euro, and British Pound, appreciated versus the U.S. Dollar by approximately 4%, 20%, 20% and 11%, respectively. These increases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios. The approximate increase due to currency translation of selected captions was: accounts receivable $11.6 million, inventories $17.2 million, accounts payable and accrued expenses $11.0 million, and total stockholder's equity $113.1 million. The $113.1 million increase in stockholder's equity is included in other comprehensive income for the year and results from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in 2003 against all major functional currencies of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company's capital expenditures including expenditures for purchased dossiers and for a Company wide ERP system were $47.9 million. In 2004, the Company plans to spend up to $70.0 million. The Company has approved a number of capital projects including the construction of an additional API capacity in Copenhagen, and a company-wide information technology project, which is expected to require additional capital expenditures of approximately $3.0 million through 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2003, the Company had $58.6 million in cash and available short-term lines of credit of approximately $14.7 million and $140.0 million available under its 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the Company's short-term and long-term debt is at variable interest rates. The 2001 Credit Facility requires the Company to enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on 50% of its debt. At December 31, 2003, the Company has one outstanding interest rate agreement to fix interest rates for $100.0 million of its variable rate debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates. The Company's policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001 the Company completed the acquisition of the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals Business ("OPB") and entered into a $900 million credit facility ("2001 Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement.  The 2001 Credit Facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and pa
yable.  The calculation of EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests. Certain of these covenants became more restrictive as of December 31, 2003 and will become more restrictive at March 31, 2005. The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued compliance with these financial covenants throughout 2004 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement, and therefore the Company's ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income, or on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt. Since 2001, the Company has reduced the amount of its outstanding debt and the size of the original facility by prepaying term debt by $185.0 million and by lowering the revolving line of credit by $150.0 million.  On an overall basis, senior debt and total debt at December 31, 2003 were $635.6 million and $817.2 million, respectively, compared to $520.2 million and $895.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Included in senior debt at December 31, 2003, was $220.0 million of Senior Notes, which replaced debt previously classified as Senior Subordinated Notes (see Note 13 for further details). </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's EBITDA, as defined, is affected most directly by changes in operating income.  Operating income in 2003 has been negatively affected by compliance activities in two of USHP's plants.   Significant corrective action costs have been incurred as a result of the Company's response to Form 483's issued by the FDA for the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth plants.  In addition, the corrective action plans have resulted in lower production and significant rationalization of the liquids product line at the Baltimore plant and no new product introductions during 2003, from either plant.  </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full year 2003 compliance costs amount to $34.4 million, of which approximately $18.0 million relates to external consultants (see Footnote 18 for further details). The additional internal staffing levels are necessary to support the Company's commitment to FDA compliance and are expected to continue beyond the corrective action period.  External consulting costs declined sequentially in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2003 and are expected to continue at the fourth quarter rate of approximately $2 million into 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Company's expectation that it will substantially complete corrective actions in Elizabeth and Baltimore in 2004; subject to reviews by the FDA.  The Company is preparing for possible FDA re-inspections of both facilities.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During most of 2003, the Company's most restrictive debt covenant was total debt to EBITDA ("Total Leverage Ratio").  This covenant tightens from a required maximum ratio of 4.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2003 to a required maximum ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 at March 31, 2005.  The Company remains in compliance with all its debt covenants at December 31, 2003, with approximately $35 million of EBITDA flexibility on its tightest covenant at year-end, the Interest Coverage Ratio.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed its business and financial plan for 2004 and has evaluated its flexibility in complying with each of the financial covenants as part of this process.  The Company believes it has a number of options available to provide it with increased financial flexibility, thereby ensuring continued compliance with its covenants. Certain of these options are entirely within the Company's control and others require actions of the bank group and/or a third party.  In December 2003, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to allow for certain actions associated with the Company's ability to achieve increased financial flexibility.  The amendment includes provisions enabling the Company to sell certain assets, provides for additional flexibility in the timing and application of certain financial ratio tests, and permits exclusions of certain restructuring charges and gains and losses on potential divestitures of assets and b
usinesses from the calculation of EBITDA.  Options include:</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  The Company's risk management practice includes the selective use, on a limited basis, of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements.  Such instruments are used for purposes other than trading.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in U.S. Dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies.  The Company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations.  The Company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency.  Such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>At December 31, 2003, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in Euros, Danish Krones, Norwegian Krones, British Pounds and U.S. Dollars with a notional amount of $118.5 million.  The fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material.  All contracts expire in the first three quarters of 2004.  The cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non-functional currency transactions.  The change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than $1.1 million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable.  Such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Alpharma's interest rate risk relates primarily to long-term and short-term debt which has variable interest rates and reset generally every three months.  At December 31, 2003, the Company has $380.9 million of variable rate U.S. Dollar debt under its 2001 Credit Agreement.  The 2001 Credit Agreement required the Company have at least 50% of its total debt at fixed interest rates or have interest rate protection with an initial average life of 3 years for the amount of variable rate debt necessary to have fixed and interest rate protected debt at least equal to 50% of total debt.  As required in early 2002, the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap for three years for $100.0 million of debt.  In late 2002 and early 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swaps for an additional $265.0 million to fix interest rates for 2003.  The Company's purpose was to fix rates to comply with the credit facility and lock in interest rates for 2003.  At December 31, 2003,
 only the $100.0 million interest rate swap is outstanding.</P>

</B>(a)&#9;Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has implemented a formal disclosure procedure designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Report, is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO as appropriate and in a timely manner.  The disclosure procedure involves participation by various individuals in the Company who have access to material information relating to the operations of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date").  Based on this evaluation, they concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to timely alert them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) which is required to be included in the Company's Exchange Act filings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
(b)&#9;Changes in Internal Controls</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     There has been no change in the Company's internal controls, or to the Company's knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect the Company's internal controls and procedures subsequent to the Evaluation Date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's auditors communicated to the Company's management and Audit Committee two reportable conditions in the internal controls of the USHP division that, when viewed collectively, constitute a material weakness in the Company's internal controls.  A material weakness is defined as a reportable condition in which the design or operation of one or more of the internal control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk of misstatements caused by error or fraud in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reportable conditions noted were (i) inadequate staffing and supervision at the USHP division, leading to the untimely identification and resolution of certain accounting matters; and (ii) failure to perform timely review, substantiation and evaluation of certain general ledger account balances at the USHP division.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has addressed the reportable conditions by (i) enhancing its overall control environment through extensive changes in USHP leadership, including the appointment of a new President and a new CFO in June 2003 and appointing a new VP of Supply Chain and business segment leaders in January 2004; (ii) reorganizing USHP finance and recruiting additional finance personnel; (iii) establishing a new position: Director, Internal Controls and Compliance responsible for monitoring internal controls in the USHP division; (iv) completing a review of significant balance sheet accounts; and (v) continuously assessing risks via newly established business and financial review processes within the USHP divisions.  If these actions are not successfully implemented, then our ability to report on the financial status of the Company on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.   In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.  Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential conditions, regardless of how remote.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is 
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</P>

<P>Restatement of Financial Statements</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Company has restated its consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, to adjust the previously reported inventory balances and cost of sales related to product purchased under a vendor supply contract.  The calendar year 2003 amounts throughout the footnotes have been revised as a result of this restatement.  See Note 2B.</P>

<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>The Company</U>:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma Inc. and Subsidiaries, (the "Company") is a global pharmaceutical company which develops, manufactures and markets specialty generic and proprietary human pharmaceutical and animal pharmaceutical products.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the Company acquired the pharmaceutical, animal health, bulk antibiotic and aquatic animal health business ("Alpharma Oslo") of A. L. Industrier ASA ("A. L. Industrier"), the beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B Stock. The Class B stock represents 22.7% of the total outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2003. A. L. Industrier, a Norwegian company, is able to control the Company through its ability to elect more than a majority of the Board of Directors and to cast a majority of the votes in any non-class vote of the Company's stockholders.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>

<DIR>

<P>2A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</U>:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><BR>
Principles of consolidation:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentations.</P>
<P><BR>
Use of estimates:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Cash equivalents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less.  </P>
<P><BR>
Inventories:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable is written down to its net realizable value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation.  The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.  (See Note 18 for additional information.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Property, plant and equipment:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.  When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss included in net income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciable assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. A loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the assets. Fair value is determined based upon a market quote, if available, or is based on valuation techniques.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest is capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of major construction and software development projects.  In 2003, 2002, and 2001, $167, $1,904, and $2,232 of interest costs were capitalized, respectively.</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives which are generally as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Goodwill and Intangible Assets:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1, 2002 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 142 applies to all goodwill and intangibles acquired in a business combination. Under SFAS 142, all goodwill and certain intangibles determined to have indefinite lives will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets other than goodwill will be amortized over their useful lives, generally 5-20 years, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  See Note 12 for additional detail relating to the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Foreign currency translation and transactions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations are translated using average rates in effect during the year.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in income.  Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment for 2003, 2002 and 2001 is net of $(1,358), $(1,910) and $318, respectively, representing the foreign tax effects associated with long-term intercompany advances to foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P><BR>
Derivative Instruments:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and its corresponding amendments under SFAS No. 138, (referred to hereafter as "SFAS 133"), on January 1, 2001. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized periodically in earnings or stockholders' equity, depending on the intended use of the derivative and whether the derivative is classified as a hedging instrument. Changes in fair value of the derivative instrument not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedging relationships. All cash flow hedges are linked directly to specific transactions and the Company assesses effectiveness at inception and on a quarterly basis. When it is determined that a derivative instrument is not highly effective or the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's derivative instruments, which are entered into on a limited basis, consist principally of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. These instruments are entered into in order to manage exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company carries its derivative instruments at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value of foreign currency forwards in current period earnings and changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps, which are classified as cash flow hedges, in stockholders' equity. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company selectively enters into foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell certain cash flows in non-functional currencies and to hedge certain firm commitments due in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange contracts, other than hedges of firm commitments, are accounted for as foreign currency transactions and gains or losses are included in income. Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction when it is completed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenue Recognition:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment.  Certain subsidiaries have terms of FOB destination where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery.  In the case of FOB destination, revenue is not recognized until products are received by the customer.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Company's U.S. Human Pharmaceutical business, and to a lesser extent in Human Pharmaceuticals - International, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, or other managed-care reserves.  Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. The Company estimates these rebates, chargebacks, managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience. The reserve balances relative to these provisions included in "Accounts receivables, net" and "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaled $64,701 and $82,387, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $65,876 and $73,184, respectively, at December 31, 2002. The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate th
ese reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in Other income is $9,081 of income earned during the 180 day exclusivity period for Metformin ER under a profit sharing agreement with another pharmaceutical company.  The income has no direct costs associated with it although it is supported by and originated from the cost structure and investments of the U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income taxes:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities between amounts recorded for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2003, the Company's share of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, (excluding cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments), was approximately $183,000. No provisions are made for U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of earnings which have been reinvested abroad or are expected to be returned in tax-free distributions. It is the Company's policy to provide for U.S. taxes payable with respect to earnings which the Company plans to repatriate.</P>
<P><BR>
Accounting for stock-based compensation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2003, the Company has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 22. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for incentive stock options, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.  Compensation cost for restricted stock is recorded based on the market value on the date of grant.  The fair value of restricted stock is charged to unearned compensation in Stockholders' Equity and amortized to expense over the requisite vesting periods.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for S
tock-Based Compensation", to stock-based employee compensation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use".  Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized software costs, net of amortization, to date through December 31, 2003 and 2002 amounted to approximately $45,417, and $43,805, respectively and are included in other assets. Amortization began in 2002, and was $10,266 and $3,643 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. All significant software modules were completed and ready for their intended purpose during 2003.  Capitalized costs are expected to be incurred in 2004 related to installation of software modules.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>In May 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002".  The statement rescinds SFAS 4 (as amended by SFAS 64), which required extraordinary item treatment for gains and losses on extinguishments of debt, and SFAS 44, which does not affect the Company. Additionally, the statement amends certain provisions of SFAS 13 and other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS 145 related to extinguishments of debt were effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2003, and all other provisions became effective for transactions occurring on or financial statements issued after May&nbsp;5, 2002.  The Company has adop
ted SFAS 145, on January 1, 2003, and conformed the prior periods presented in the previously filed Form 10K to reflect this adoption. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities".  This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)".  This Statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in Issue 94-3, and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  This Statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.  SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. Any charges associated with future restructuring programs will be recor
ded in accordance with SFAS 146. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" was issued.  FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.  The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 21, 2002.  The required disclosures are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 31, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure". Statement 148 amends FASB Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition to Statement 123's fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Statement 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of statement 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting", to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity's accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. While the Statement does not amend Statement 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of Statement 148 are applicable to all companies with stock-ba
sed employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of Statement 123 or the intrinsic value method of Opinion 25. Statement 148's amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of Statement 123 are effective for fiscal years ending after December&nbsp;15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of FAS 148 as of December 31, 2002, and will continue to use the intrinsic value method of APB 25.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. The consolidation provisions of FIN 46 were originally effective for financial periods ending after July 15, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FIN 46-6, "Effective Date of FIN 46," which delayed the implementation date for certain variable interest entities to financial periods ending after December 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB published a revision to FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46, and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. The Company does not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on the results of operatio
ns, cash flows or financial position.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) released EITF 00-21: "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables".  EITF 00-21 clarifies the timing and recognition of revenue from certain transactions that include the delivery and performance of multiple products or services.  EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.  The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact on the Company's Financial Statements.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("the Act") ("FSP FAS 106-1"). FSP FAS 106-1 allows for current recognition or a one-time deferral of the effects of the Act. The deferral suspends the application of SFAS No. 106's "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," measurement requirements, and it revised SFAS 132's disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement plans for the effects of the Act. The Company has elected to take the one-time deferral and, therefore, any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the Act. Specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy included in the 
Act is pending. The guidance, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported information. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>In December 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 104, "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 104"), which supercedes SAB 101. SAB 104's primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21. As previously discussed, the Company's adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and, consequently, the Company's revenue recognition policy is in accordance with SAB 104. </P>

2B.&nbsp;<U>Financial Statement Restatement - 2003</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has restated its Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 and its interim quarterly information for 2003, to adjust the previously reported inventory balances and cost of sales related to products purchased under a vendor supply contract.  The contract was the subject of an Amendment and Letter of Intent (the "A/LOI") entered into in January 2003 and effective January 1, 2003.  The A/LOI included higher minimum purchase commitments for the Company and required the vendor to invoice Alpharma for products purchased subsequent to its effective date at a reduced price from that prevailing in the previous supply contract.  The terms of the A/LOI, including the minimum purchase commitments and the reduced pricing were, however, subject to the successful negotiation and execution of a final agreement.  To the extent a final agreement was not reached, the A/LOI provided that either party could terminate the agreement and, upon su
ch termination, the vendor could retroactively invoice the Company for inventory purchases since January 1, 2003, at the higher previous supply contract price.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2003, the Company purchased quantities sufficient to satisfy the minimum purchase commitments of the A/LOI, the vendor invoiced the Company at the lower A/LOI prices and, the Company recorded inventory purchases at the lower invoiced prices.  However, no final agreement on a new vendor supply agreement was reached.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;After further review of the terms of the A/LOI, the Company has concluded that, for accounting purposes, the termination provisions in the A/LOI were such that, the realization of the lower prices in the A/LOI was contingent upon the execution of a final agreement.  Accordingly, the Company should have been recording its 2003 inventory purchases and the resulting cost of sales at the higher, previous supply contract prices. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restatement reflects the difference between the higher prices in the previous supply contract and the lower A/LOI prices that were invoiced by the vendor throughout 2003.  The restatement results in increased cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 and inventory at December 31, 2003 of $4,870 and $1,467, respectively, with a corresponding increase in accrued expenses at December 31, 2003 of $6,337.  During 2004, the Company continues to purchase products from this vendor and has recorded these purchases at the higher previous supply contract price.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2004, in accordance with the terms of the A/LOI, the Company notified the vendor that, due to the failure of the parties to move toward a definitive agreement, it was exercising its notification right to terminate the supply agreement.  In response to this notification, in March 2004, the vendor invoiced Alpharma approximately $6,400 for the price difference between the A/LOI and the previous supply contract for all 2003 purchases.  In spite of this, the Company and the vendor have continued to negotiate in earnest towards a new supply agreement.  As a part of these negotiations, the Company reasserted its belief that it had performed all its obligations under the A/LOI for the year 2003.  On April 30, 2004, the vendor confirmed this understanding in writing with regard to minimum quantities and advised the Company it had been paid in full for all 2003 purchases and that the $6,400 invoice for 2003 purchases may be disregarded.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will determine the accounting for the $6,337 price differential that was recorded in accrued expenses at December 31, 2003, at the time it either completes its current negotiations for a new supply contract or when it has ceased doing business with the vendor.  If the Company enters into a final agreement or a new supply agreement with the vendor, the price differential would be amortized over the units purchased under the agreement, which is analogous to the accounting for an up-front payment in Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor."  If the Company does not enter into a final agreement with the vendor and ceases its current supply arrangement, the price differential would be recognized in income at that time, which is analogous to the accounting for a gain contingency in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies."  </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001 the Company completed the acquisition of the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals Business ("OPB") and entered into a $900,000 credit facility ("2001 Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement.  The 2001 Credit Facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.  The calculation of EBITDA, as def
ined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests. Certain of these covenants became more restrictive as of December 31, 2003 and will become more restrictive at March 31, 2005. The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued compliance with these financial covenants in 2004 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement, and therefore the Company's ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income, or on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt. Since 2001, the Company has reduced the amount of its outstanding debt and the size of the original facility by prepaying term debt by $185,000 and by lowering the revolving line of credit by $150,000.  On an overall basis, senior debt and total debt at December 31, 2003 were $635,603 and $817,156, respectively, compared to $520,153 and $895,858, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Included in senior debt at December 31, 2003, was $220,000 of Senior Notes issued in 2003 (see Note 13 for further details). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's EBITDA, as defined, is affected most directly by changes in operating income.  Operating income in 2003 has been negatively affected by corrective actions in two of U.S. Human Pharmaceutical's plants. Significant compliance costs have been incurred as a result of the Company's response to Form 483's issued by the FDA for the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth plants.  In addition, the corrective action plans have resulted in lower production and significant rationalization of the liquids product line at the Baltimore plant and no new product introductions during 2003, from either plant.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2003 compliance costs amount to $34,400, of which approximately $18,000 relates to external consultants (see Footnote 18 for further details) and the remainder relates to increased internal resources. The additional internal staffing levels are necessary to support the Company's commitment to FDA compliance and are expected to continue beyond the corrective action period.  External consulting costs declined sequentially in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2003 and are expected to continue at the fourth quarter rate of approximately $2,000 into 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company plans to complete the major elements of the FDA compliance enhancement plan in Elizabeth by mid 2004 and new solid dose product launches are contingent on the receipt of FDA approval. The Company expects to complete the major elements of the FDA compliance enhancement plan in Baltimore by the end of 2004.  The Company is preparing for possible FDA re-inspections of both facilities.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During most of 2003, the Company's most restrictive debt covenant was total debt to EBITDA ("Total Leverage Ratio").  This covenant tightens from a required maximum ratio of 4.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2003 to a required maximum ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 at March 31, 2005. The Company remained in compliance with all its debt covenants at December 31, 2003, with approximately $35,000 of EBITDA flexibility on its tightest covenant at year-end, the Interest Coverage Ratio.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed its business and financial plan for 2004 and has evaluated its flexibility in complying with each of the financial covenants as part of this process.  The Company believes it has a number of options available to provide it with increased financial flexibility, thereby ensuring continued compliance with its covenants.  Certain of these options are entirely within the Company's control and others require actions of the bank group and/or a third party. In December 2003, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to allow for certain actions associated with the Company's ability to achieve increased financial flexibility. The amendment includes provisions enabling the Company to sell certain assets, provides for additional flexibility in the timing and application of certain financial ratio tests, and permits exclusions of certain restructuring charges and gains and losses on potential divestitures of assets and businesses from the calculation of EBITDA. Op
tions include:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Continued aggressive asset management, including both working capital reduction programs and controls over capital expenditures, to generate free cash flow to enable the Company to continue to repay outstanding debt.  Capital expenditures were $47,871 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $81,703 for the year ended December 31, 2002.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>



<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Continue to reduce operating costs. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reviewed its overall business cost structure, which resulted in a reduction in force at each of its segments. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $8,700 related to this action.    The Company is evaluating other actions to reduce its cost base in 2004 and beyond.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Continue to sell certain assets. In 2003, the Company has sold its French generics business and an Animal Health facility.  The Company has engaged investment bankers to explore the possible sale of certain other assets.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The potential divesture of significant assets and businesses are in the preliminary stages and none are subject to formal agreements.  It is possible that, if completed, certain of the divestitures could result in losses of up to $100,000. In addition, the potential divestitures could be dilutive to the Company's continuing earnings per share. There is no guarantee any divestiture will be completed.  Due to its improved liquidity in 2003, the Company is not under any financial pressure to accept any offer which is not in its long term interests.</LI></P></UL>

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the bank group agreed to an amendment which allowed for specified asset sales, permitted exclusions of restructuring and refinancing charges from EBITDA of up to $10,000 and the minimum net worth definitions, and amended the leverage ratios to delay the timing of further covenant restrictions.  The Company believes that its performance in the reduction of the loan, and its previous experience in working with the bank group would assist it in obtaining future amendments, if necessary.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 12, 2001, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the generic and proprietary oral solid dose pharmaceuticals business ("OPB acquisition") in the U.S. and China of F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited from Mayne Nickless Limited for total consideration of $660,000 in cash (approximately $669,800 including direct acquisition related costs). On October 2, 2001, Mayne closed its tender offer for Faulding's shares after having accepted the tender of more than 90% of Faulding's shares. On October 5, 2001, Alpharma gained operational and economic control of OPB subject to certain limitations. On December 12, 2001 Mayne acquired 100% of Faulding's shares and transferred the OPB to the Company in accordance with the acquisition agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations". The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of OPB operations are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition, December 12, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of the Oral Pharmaceuticals Business includes the operations of Purepac Pharmaceuticals and Faulding Laboratories in the United States and Foshan Faulding Pharmaceutical China. The Oral Pharmaceuticals Business includes research, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing of generic and proprietary oral solid dose pharmaceuticals in the United States and China.  In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, the OPB had net sales of $205,200 (unaudited) comprised of US net sales of $190,700 (unaudited) and China net sales of $14,500 (unaudited). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&amp;D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&amp;D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as fol

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, the Company adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation for changes in account balances resulting from the final valuation, adjustments to the opening balance sheet and certain reclassifications. The most significant changes resulted in a reclassification of approximately $25,500 from goodwill to intangible assets related to the valuation of certain product rights, and a reduction of goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $26,000 as amortization of certain identified intangibles were determined to be deductible for tax purposes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase price was allocated based on a final valuation in the following manner:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, new AH management in its review of current projects decided to discontinue support of the Optibreed project and incurred charges of approximately $11,200 to reflect the write-down of Optibreed inventory and the equity investment in the company which manufactured Optibreed inventory.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 2002, the Company became aware of process deficiencies, which occurred in 2001 for two products sold by USHP.  One of these products was manufactured by a contract manufacturer.  Based on the nature of the deficiencies, the Company determined that a voluntary recall of these products from its direct customers was required.  Accordingly, at December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $10,700 for these recalls, consisting primarily of inventory write-offs for unsaleable product and estimated disposal costs.</P>

The AH business, which is in low or no growth competitive markets, has been repositioned to enhance working capital management and cash flow. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1999, AH acquired the business of Southern Cross Biotech, Pty. Ltd. ("Southern Cross") and the exclusive worldwide license for Reporcin, a product which is used to aid in the production of leaner pork meat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the license agreement, additional payments are required as regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets. The Company also was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin to complement the acquired Reporcin manufacturing facility. To meet that requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June 2000 and began to prepare the facility for production of Reporcin. In early 2002, the Company commissioned an independent study to re-evaluate the market potential of Reporcin in the U.S. market. At the same time the Company halted the work to prepare the Terre Haute facility for Reporcin production. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2002 the Company received the results of the independent study on the market viability in the U.S. for Reporcin. The study identified a number of business risks that translated into slower market penetration and lower cash flows than previously forecasted. As a result of the revised expected value of Reporcin in the U.S., the Company decided to sell the Terre Haute facility and wrote-down the facility to its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company incurred an impairment charge related to the building and fixed assets of $16,353 and accrued for certain exit and shut-down costs in the amount of $2,342.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study also caused the Company to reassess the forecasts of future sales of Reporcin in markets where the Company has regulatory approval. The intangible and prepaid royalty balances totaling approximately $21,800 for these markets were compared by market to the undiscounted cash flows. Since impairment was indicated, discounted cash flows were prepared and an impairment charge of $17,023 was recorded. The Company also has re-evaluated the carrying value of the Reporcin manufacturing facility and inventory on hand and wrote-down the inventory to the lower of cost or market, thereby incurring a charge of $1,382.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to investigate alternative methods to service the U.S. market and will continue to market Reporcin in markets where registrations have been received.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Impairment - AH Goodwill</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the required annual 2002 impairment test, the entire goodwill of Animal Health was written-off resulting in a charge of $66,011. (See Note 12.) New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure resulted in lower forecasted cash flows.  The former strategy of growth through new products, technologies and international market expansion was changed to a strategy to maximize cash generation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH Facility Closures</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Company's repositioning and cash generation strategy, in December 2002, the Company announced the closing of four Animal Health facilities, certain asset write-downs and work force reductions.  The facility closings included plants in Missouri, Arkansas, Australia and a research center in New Jersey, which resulted in write-downs and exit costs of $45,192 (consisting of $40,144 of asset impairments and $5,048 of cost of sales).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Impairment - IG Intangible Assets</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2002, all significant intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". Due to a increased competitive influence in these marketplaces and continued government regulation, the Company determined intangible assets for specific products for the German and French markets needed to be tested and were determined to be impaired. Impairment charges totaling $13,487 were recorded in the fourth quarter based on results of a probability weighted cash flow assessment or independent market valuation.  Included therein is an intangible asset impairment of $7,008 related to the discontinued operations of the Company's French subsidiary.</P>

These charges represented approximately 175, 139 and 121 employees in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are classified as Asset impairments and other within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2000, the Company's Danish subsidiary sold the patents, trademarks, marketing authorizations, and inventory related to the Elyzol Dental Gel ("EDG") product for cash proceeds of approximately $8,250. Concurrently with this sale, and due to the specialized nature of the manufacturing process for EDG, the Company entered into a Toll Manufacturing Agreement with the purchaser under which the Company will continue to manufacture EDG for the purchaser for a four-year period. The Company is reimbursed for direct manufacturing costs plus an agreed upon amount for overhead and a variable manufacturing profit which declines as production volumes increase. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>

The deferral initially amounted to approximately $7,800 and is being amortized over the four year term of the Toll Manufacturing agreement on a straight-line basis, which management believes will approximate amortization using the units of production method. Income from the Transition Service Agreement and the contractual profit under the Toll Manufacturing Agreement are being recognized as services are provided or goods are sold to the purchaser.</P>

At December 31, 2003, $12,498 of these raw materials previously included in inventories has been reclassified to prepaid expenses and other, as the cost of the raw materials will be recoverable upon receipt of replacement inventory. Upon receipt, the raw materials will be reclassified as inventory. See Note 18 for additional information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed from the last-in first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in first-out (FIFO) method to account for certain of its United States USHP inventories. The method was changed in part to achieve a better matching of revenues and expense. While a change from the LIFO method to the FIFO methods requires retroactive application to the financial statements, the change was not material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any of the periods presented as the inventory values computed under the LIFO method approximated the inventory values computed under the FIFO method. The FIFO method, or methods that approximate FIFO, are now used to determine cost for all inventories of the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible assets consist principally of one major intangible asset class, products rights, including regulatory and/or marketing approvals by relevant government authorities. All intangible assets are subject to amortization. Annual amortization expense for the years 2004 through 2008 is currently estimated to be approximately $33,100, $32,300, $30,200, $28,500 and $27,600, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifiable intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. In Germany, in 2003, one product important to the Company's German operations, Pentalong, was required to reprove safety and efficacy by the fourth quarter of 2004.  If the Company cannot complete the study satisfactorily, the Company will be required to re-evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets totaling approximately $18,000. The Company believes, but cannot assure, it will be successful.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net intangible asset reclassifications represent product rights (as discussed above) which had been separately identified but which had been classified as goodwill for financial reporting purposes prior to the adoption of SFAS 142. All goodwill is not subject to amortization as of January 1, 2002. The Company assigned intangibles and goodwill to identified reporting units, completed the transitional impairment test as required, and determined that there was no impairment of existing goodwill as of January 1, 2002. This assessment was made utilizing forecasted cash flows discounted at a rate of 11%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As required in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company performed the required annual test for impairment. The assessment was made in conjunction with the budgeting and long-range planning by each segment. The assessment utilized essentially the same methodology as the initial testing. The Animal Health segment indicated a possible impairment due to emerging external factors which included increasing competition, and lower prices. Additionally, the Company re-evaluated its prior growth plans internationally and domestically for new and existing products. The re-evaluation indicated growth prospects had diminished and the segment should be operated to maximize cash generation. The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to perform step two testing and, as a result, wrote off all of the Animal Health goodwill, totaling $66,011.</P>

</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpharma Operating Corporation ("Alpharma Operating Corporation"), and certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement ("2001 Credit Facility") with the Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions that provides up to a maximum of $900,000 of senior credit facilities. The 2001 Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  The agreement replaced the prior revolving credit facility, provided the funds required for the acquisition of OPB and related financing costs and increased overall credit availability. The 1999 revolving credit facility was repaid on October 5, 2001 by drawing down on the 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At closing, the 2001 Credit Facility provided for (i) a $300,000 six year revolving credit facility; (ii) a $175,000 six year Term Loan A; and (iii) a $425,000 seven year Term Loan B.  In December 2001 the Company prepaid $65,000 of the Term A and Term B loans resulting in the maximum amount available to be borrowed under the 2001 Credit Facility being reduced to $835,000.  In 2003 and 2002, the Company prepaid an additional $35,000 and $85,000, respectively of the Term A and Term B loans and recorded an expense for the early extinguishment of debt of $692 and $1,791 (classified in other, net).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2002, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to reduce the revolving credit facility to $150,000. As a result of the modification to the revolving debt arrangement, the Company recognized the related portion of unamortized costs in the statement of income in the amount of $3,176 (classified in other, net). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility has several financial covenants including a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio, senior debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.  In December 2003, an amendment was approved which allowed for specified asset sales, permitted exclusions of restructuring and refinancing charges from EBITDA of up to $10,000 and the required net worth definitions and amended the leverage ratios to delay the timing of further covenant restrictions (see Note 3).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the 2001 Credit Facility the Company is required to have a specified percentage of its indebtedness at a fixed interest rate. To comply with this requirement, in January 2002 the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap in order to fix the interest rate on $60,000 of its variable rate borrowings under the 2001 credit facility. As a result of an additional reduction in fixed rate indebtedness due to the exchanges of subordinated debt in March 2002 (discussed below), the Company settled this interest rate swap and entered into a standard interest rate swap to effectively fix the interest rate on $100,000 of its variable rate borrowings at a fixed rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2002. The Company reviews and renews its swap requirements on a quarterly basis. The Company accounts for this swap as a cash flow hedge. Unrealized losses of approximately $1,954, net of related tax benefits, are included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Stockho
lders' Equity as a component of comprehensive income (loss).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial covenants, the 2001 Credit Agreement has a number of non-financial covenants. These non-financial covenants include a requirement that control over the Company not be transferred from an entity controlled by E.W. Sissener, the Chairman of the Company, or his family, if as a result or at anytime after such transfer a third party holds shares representing 20% or more of the voting rights in the Company. A. L. Industrier ASA ("ALI"), an entity controlled by Mr. Sissener and his family (and a holding company whose only material business is holding shares of the Company), currently controls the Company by beneficial ownership of all of the Company's Class B shares which carries the right to elect a majority of the Company's directors. The continuation of ALI's control of the Company remains subject to the unilateral actions of ALI.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 24, 2003, the Company sold $220,000 aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8 Senior Notes due 2011. The proceeds of the offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were $197,000. These proceeds, together with funds available from other sources, were used to repay existing 12.5% Senior Subordinated Notes of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The fees paid to the initial purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes of $22,191 were made pursuant to arrangements originally entered into in December 2001. The transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of the existing Senior Subordinated Notes. As a result, both the fees of $22,191 paid in April 2003 and the unamortized loan costs of $6,217 associated with the Senior Subordinated Notes, were expensed in the second quarter 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2003, in connection with the offering of the 8 5/8% Senior Notes, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility to exclude from the definition of EBITDA costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 8 5/8% Notes, including the placement fee, to permit the 8 5/8% Notes to be an unsecured senior debt obligation of the Company and to change the senior debt to EBITDA covenant to a senior secured debt to EBITDA covenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility's Term A is payable in quarterly installments ranging from $5,136 to $5,992 through 2007.  The Term B is payable in quarterly installments of $729 with balloon payment of $271,915 in 2008.  In the event that more than $10,000 of either the 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 or the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 are outstanding within six months of their due date, the entire remaining balance of the Term A, Term B and the Revolving Credit becomes due and payable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has issued Industrial Development Revenue Bonds in connection with various expansion projects. In 2003, the Company repaid bonds with a $2,500 principal amount previously requiring monthly interest payments at a floating rate approximating the current money market rate on tax-exempt bonds plus agency and other fees (total rate approximately 4.5%). In addition, the Company repaid bonds with a $1,740 principal amount in 2003, with the remaining $1,200 principal amount requiring fixed interest payments of between 6.875% and 7.25%. The remaining balance of $1,200 was repaid on January 2, 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortgage notes payable denominated in Norwegian Kroner (NOK) include amounts issued in connection with the construction and subsequent expansion of a pharmaceutical facility in Lier, Norway. The mortgage is collateralized by this facility (net book value $31,800). The debt was borrowed in a number of tranches over the construction period and interest is fixed for specified periods based on actual yields of Norgeskreditt publicly traded bonds plus a lending margin of 0.70%. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 5.2% and 7.6%, respectively. The tranches are repayable in semiannual installments through 2021.  Yearly principal payments are approximately $1,300.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2001, in connection with the formal closing of the OPB acquisition, Alpharma Operating Corporation sold $200,000 in principal amount of 12% senior subordinated notes due 2009 to affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and CIBC World Markets Corp.  These notes were repaid on April 24, 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1999, the Company issued $170,000 principal amount of 3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "06 Notes"). The 06 Notes pay cash interest of 3% per annum, calculated on the initial principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2006 at a price of 134.104% of the initial principal amount. The payment of the principal amount of the Notes at maturity (or earlier, if the Notes are redeemed by the Company prior to maturity), together with cash interest paid over the term of the Notes, will yield investors 6.875% per annum. The interest accrued but which will not be paid prior to maturity (3.875% per annum) is reflected as long-term debt in the accounts of the Company. The 06 Notes are redeemable by the Company after June 16, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 06 Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into 31.1429 shares of the Company's Class A Common stock per one thousand dollars of initial principal amount of 06 Notes. This ratio results in an initial conversion price of $32.11 per share. The number of shares into which a 06 Note is convertible will not be adjusted for the accretion of principal or for accrued interest. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2002, the Company completed an exchange of 3,433,104 shares of its Class A Common Stock for a portion of its 06 Notes having an approximate principal value of $53,400.  The exchange resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $26,982 ($16,487 after tax) in the first quarter of 2002 (classified in Other, net).</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, the Company issued $125,000 of 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "05 Notes") due 2005. The 05 Notes may be converted into common stock at $28.594 at any time prior to maturity, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company may redeem the 05 Notes, in whole or in part, at a premium plus accrued interest.  Concurrently, A. L. Industrier ASA ("ALI"), the controlling stockholder of the Company, purchased at par for cash $67,850 principal amount of a Convertible Subordinated Note (the "Industrier Note"). The Industrier Note had substantially identical adjustment terms and interest rate as the 05 Notes. </P>

This is the number of shares that ALI was entitled to receive upon conversion of the Industrier Note pursuant to its terms.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2003, the Company has state loss carry forwards in several states totaling approximately $186,000, which are available to offset future taxable income and expire between 2009 and 2023. The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these state loss carry forwards. The Company also has foreign loss carry forwards in thirteen countries as of December 31, 2003, of approximately $190,000, which are available to offset future taxable income, and have carry forward periods ranging from five years to unlimited.  The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these foreign loss carry forwards.  Based on analysis of current information, which indicated that it is not likely that some of these state and foreign losses will be realized, a valuation allowance has been established for a portion of these loss carry forwards. At December 31, 2001 the comparitive deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $6,301. Most of the increa
se in the valuation allowance relates to separate company loss carryforwards where uncertainty exists in regard to the future utilization of the loss carryforwards by those separate companies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has recorded certain U.S. deferred tax assets for which it has provided no valuation allowances. These U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as any newly generated deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.  If it were considered to be more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets would not be realized, a valuation allowance would be established against some or all of the deferred tax assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company's assessment of its net U.S. deferred tax assets of $27,665 at December&nbsp;31, 2003, based upon certain available tax planning strategies, the Company considers it more likely than not that these net U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore, no valuation allowance was required at December 31, 2003. Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized, a valuation allowance would be required and the Company's operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such determination would be made.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a qualified noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its domestic employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five years compensation during the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Ideally, the Plan's assets will approximate the accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO"). The plan assets are under a single custodian and a single investment manager. Plan assets are invested in equities, government securities and bonds. In addition, the Company has unfunded supplemental executive pension plans providing additional benefits to certain employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an unfunded postretirement medical and nominal life insurance plan ("postretirement benefits") covering certain domestic employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993. The plan has not been extended to any additional employees. Retired eligible employees are required to contribute for coverage as if they were active employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postretirement transition obligation as of January 1, 1993 of $1,079 is being amortized over twenty years. The discount rate used in determining the 2003, 2002 and 2001 expense was 6.25%, 6.75% and 7.50%, respectively. The health care cost trend rate was 10% for 2004, declining to 5% for 2009, remaining level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the reported amounts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, ALI purchased a convertible subordinated note issued by the Company in the amount of $67,850. In October 2001 the Company exchanged the convertible subordinate note into 2,372,897 shares of Class B common stock. (See Note 13.) In addition, as of December 31, 2002 there was a net current receivable of $106 from ALI.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and ALI have an administrative service agreement whereby the Company provides management services to ALI. The agreement provides for payment equal to the direct and indirect cost of providing the services subject to a minimum amount. The agreement is automatically extended for one year each January 1, but may be terminated by either party upon six months notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the agreement to purchase Alpharma Oslo, ALI retained the ownership of the Sk&oslash;yen manufacturing facility and administrative offices (not including leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment) and leases it to the Company. The Company is required to pay all expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the facility in addition to nominal rent. The lease has an initial 20-year term and is renewable at the then fair rental value at the option of the Company for four consecutive five year terms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company signed a net lease agreement with ALI that provides for the leasing of a parking lot at the Skoyen Facililty through an initial term of October 2014 with the possibility of four consecutive five-year renewal terms. The annual rental is 2.4 million Norwegian Kroner. (Approximately $340 at current exchange rates.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2003, the Company divested its Norwegian vitamin business to Nopal, a subsidiary of ALI, for approximately $3,300. The divestiture was a transaction between companies under common control and accordingly, the gain on the sale was accounted for as a capital transaction net of related taxes ($2,267 net increase to Additional Paid-in Capital). As required of all related party transactions, the sale was determined to be fair to the holders Class A Common Stock by the Company's Audit and Corporate Governance Committee.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">18.<B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><U>Contingent Liabilities and Litigation</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  This class action has been brought on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company's securities between April 28, 1999 and October 30, 2000.  The Company is named as a defendant along with two of its board members, one of whom is an officer, and two of its former officers.  The class action complaint alleges that, among other things, the plaintiffs were damaged when they acquired the Company's securities because, as a result of (1) alleged irregularities in the Company's Animal Health business in Brazil, (2) allegedly improper revenue recognition practices and (3) the October 2000 revision of its financial results for 1999 and 2000, the Company's previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company's securities.  The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and R
ule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on legal grounds and the District Court granted its motion with prejudice as to all defendants.  The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court and the District Court affirmed its earlier dismissal.  The plaintiffs have appealed the Court's decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  All permitted briefs have been filed with the Third Circuit and oral argument was completed in 2003. The Company has vigorously defended this appeal.  Additionally, the Company has filed a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the named individual defendants under its directors' and officers' insurance policies and believes that insurance coverage exists to the extent of the policy limits for the costs incurred in defending the claims and any adverse judgment or settlement, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the relevant i
nsurance policy.  Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class action will result in liability which will be material to the Company's financial position.  However, it is not possible for the Company to conclude definitively that resolution of the lawsuit will not be material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or year in which it occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements.  Deposition and document discovery is underway.  The SEC has stated that the commencement of this investigation is not an indication that the SEC presently believes that a violation of any applicable laws has occurred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Baltimore and Elizabeth, respectively.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from, primarily, cGMPs.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has not formally commented on the Company's corrective action plan.  The FDA performed another inspection of the Baltimore facility in February of 2004 and issued a 483 Report detailing plant deficiencies.  While the FDA has not indicated to the Company its position as to any of the items set forth on this February 2004 483 Report, the number and scope of the comments has declined significantly from the Report received in August 2002.  The Company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore plant in a
ccordance with the October 2002 corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by the end of 2004.  As part of the corrective action plan, product recalls were conducted in 2002 and production at the Baltimore facility was reduced in several increments during 2002 and 2003.  This reduction in production has had an effect on earnings and the possibility of an adverse effect in 2004 was incorporated into the Company budgeting process.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between November, 2002 and January, 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA on January 15, 2003.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response on February 5, 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The Company originally anticipated completion of these actions on or about the end of 2003.  However, the FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report alleging continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations. As a result the Company now anticipates completion of a significant portion of its corrective actions in mid 2004, with the remainder by March 2005.  Certain product recalls were included in the original corrective action plan which were completed in 2002 and 2003.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated total external consultant costs of the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective actions is approximately $8.0 million for 2004.  In addition, the Company has added significant internal personnel (largely quality and laboratory personnel) at both Elizabeth and Baltimore.</P>
<P><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDAs filed under paragraph IV for gabapentin capsules and tablets, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998 with respect to capsules and on December 12, 1999 with respect to tablets, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and the FDA that its proposed generic gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.  In the litigation concerning the Company's gabapentin capsules, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the two patents, which was subsequently denied.  The Company filed in the table
t litigation, and renewed in the capsule litigation, the Company's motion of summary judgment of non-infringement on Pfizer's patents.  These motions have been decided in the Company's favor by the District Court.  &nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the lawsuits regarding gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels.  After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under paragraph IV that the Company's proposed gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable.  In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this patent.  The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent.  This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three gabapentin cases have been consolidated for trial, but no trial date has been set.  Unless and until the Company decides to utilize such authorization to market its gabapentin tablets or capsules, the Company would, in the event of an adverse decision, at most, only be liable to Pfizer for its legal costs and not any monetary damages.  To date, the Company has not marketed these pharmaceuticals.  There is the possibility that as a result of this litigation, the Company could be prevented from marketing the Company's gabapentin capsules or tablets until Pfizer's patents expire. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that it has secured eligibility for 180 day market exclusivity on gabapentin 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules.  Exclusivity for this product will be triggered by the earlier of either Purepac's commercial marketing of gabapentin or a court decision that finds the relevant Pfizer patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  On February 14, 2003, Torpharm, a competitor that has filed an ANDA for gabapentin capsules, filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA.  Both this District Court and a federal appellate court upheld the FDA award to the Company.  The Company can give no assurance that it will ultimately benefit from an exclusivity period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the launch of gabapentin, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (the "GAPI") of gabapentin under which the Company has acquired GAPI inventory.  The terms of the Company's agreement with the GAPI supplier will require the payment to the supplier of a portion of the Company's net sales of finished dose gabapentin product during any period of exclusivity ("Net Sales Split").  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had paid approximately $12,500 in partial payment of GAPI inventory.  The Company will make additional payments of approximately $22,800 and $10,500 in 2004 and 2005, respectively, for GAPI inventory received and ordered. All of these payments reduce the Net Sales Split on a dollar for dollar basis.  Other than outstanding purchase orders for GAPI to be received subsequent to year-end, the Company has no additional obligation to purchase additional GAPI inventory.  The Company cannot pre
dict the outcome of the gabapentin litigation; however, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, or other factors preventing the Company from selling the finished product, the Company will reassess the net realizable value of the GAPI, and may incur a charge to write-down GAPI to its net realizable value and record any required payments under the supply agreement.  The maximum charge could be approximately $46,000 based on GAPI currently on hand or ordered.  In addition, the Company is negotiating certain changes in the arrangement with its GAPI supplier which, if unsuccessful, could require the Company to make a $3,000 payment to the GAPI supplier.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is one of multiple defendants in a lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General alleging Medicaid fraud in connection with the manner the Company utilizes to establish the "average wholesale price" for its various drugs.  In addition four other state Attorneys General have given the Company notice that said agencies are investigating what appear to be similar claims.  The Company believes that the manner in which it establishes its "average wholesale prices" is reasonable and proper and furthermore that it practices in this regard are generally similar to those used by others in the pharmaceutical industry.  </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Trade Commission is undertaking a formal investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding a 1998 agreement with Perrigo Inc. under which the Company (i) renunciated its 180 Waxman-Hatch marketing exclusivity for a certain product and (ii) granted a license under a patent related to the product in return for royalty payments form Perrigo.  The FTC is presently engaged in deposition and document discovery and has not taken any action which would indicate a belief that either the Company or Perrigo violated applicable law.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has been named in a lawsuit which alleges that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce litter that contains a high level of arsenic.  The suit further alleges that this litter, when used as agricultural fertilizer by the chicken farmer, causes cancer in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields).  In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the plaintiff's, there is the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in the lawsuit.  The plaintiff's are also requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue.  The Company has not yet been served in this matter and therefore has not had the opportunity to participate in any discovery to form a view on the plaintiff's allegations.  Sales of this product were approximately $24 million in 2003.  </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had foreign currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of approximately $118,487, and $132,600, respectively. These contracts called for the exchange of Scandinavian and European currencies and in some cases the U.S. Dollar to meet commitments in or sell cash flows generated in non-functional currencies. All outstanding contracts will expire in 2004 and the unrealized gains and losses are not material.  The Company does not account for these transactions as hedges under FAS 133. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counterparties to derivative agreements are major financial institutions. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also used interest rate swaps to hedge variable interest rates, in accordance with the requirements of the 2001 Credit Facility. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with offsetting amounts, included in Other Comprehensive Loss on an after-tax basis in the amount of $1,954.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the derivative fair value that are designated as effective and qualify in cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedge transactions occur and are then recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2003, the Company uses hedged transactions covered under FAS 133 exclusively to manage risk under variable interest rate debt. The Company has structured all existing interest rate swap agreements as 100% effective. As a result, there is no current impact to earnings resulting for hedge ineffectiveness. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently has the following interest rate swap, classified as a cash flow hedge as of December 31, 2003:</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt other than the subordinated notes approximates fair value because a significant portion of the underlying debt is at variable rates and reprices frequently. The fair value of the 2005 and 2006 subordinated notes is based on the bid price of the notes, which are publicly traded.  The fair value of the 2011 senior notes and the 2009 subordinated notes, which are not publicly traded, have been calculated based on comparable market yields at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was as follows:</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to May 19, 2003, the Company's 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan"), the Company granted options to key employees to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. The maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Plan was 8,000,000. In addition, the Company had a Non-Employee Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan") which provided for the issue of up to 350,000 shares of Class A Common stock. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan could not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Options granted expired from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options were exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. The Plan permitted a cash appreciation right to be granted to certain employees. Included in options outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2003 are options to purchase 27,550 shares with cash appreciatio
n rights, 15,350 of which are exercisable. If an option holder ceased to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which were not vested at the date of termination were forfeited. As of December 31, 2002, options for 1,768,423 shares were available for future grant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 19, 2003, the Company's stockholders approved the Alpharma Inc. 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, (the "Incentive Compensation Plan").  The Incentive Compensation Plan permits stock option grants, stock appreciation rights grants ("SARs"), annual incentive awards, stock grants, restricted stock grants, restricted stock unit grants, performance stock grants, performance units grants, and cash awards.  Upon adoption of the Incentive Compensation Plan, no additional options were granted under the previously existing plans and all shares reserved under these existing plans were returned to the Company's supply of authorized but unissued shares, not reserved for any purpose, although outstanding options granted pursuant to the previously existing plans will remain outstanding.  Upon adoption, the maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Incentive Compensation Plan was 4,750,000 and the number of shares that were permitted to be issued for Awards o
ther than stock options or SARS, (both with a grant price equal to at least fair market value), were not to exceed a total of 2,000,000 shares.  Options granted expire from three to ten years after the grant date.  Generally, options are exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant.  If an option holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which are not vested at the date of termination are forfeited.  As of December 31, 2003, 6,430,310 shares are available for future grant under all plans.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the Company adopted SFAS 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". The Company's reportable segments are the four businesses described in Note 1, (i.e. IG, API, USHP, AH). Each business operates in a distinct business and/or geographic area.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of each segment are evaluated based on earnings before interest and taxes (operating income).  Unallocated includes corporate expenses for administration, finance, legal and certain unallocated expenses primarily related to the implementation of a company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning System. Eliminations include inter-segment sales. Geographic revenues represent sales to third parties by country in which the selling legal entity is domiciled. Operating assets directly attributable to business segments are included in identifiable assets (i.e. sum of accounts receivable, inventories, net property, plant and equipment and net intangible assets). Cash, prepaid expenses, and other corporate and non-allocated assets are included in unallocated. For geographic reporting long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment and net intangibles.  Segment data includes immaterial inter-segment revenues. No customer accounts for more than 10% o
f consolidated revenues.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 7, 2004, the Company purchased the remaining 50% interest in Wynco, LLC ("Wynco"), an Animal Health product distribution company, that it did not previously own. The purchase price was $4,331, approximately $900 of which is payable over three years, beginning on December 31, 2004. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed debt of approximately $6,677. The investment was previously recorded in accordance with the equity method, with the original 50% interest included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of the date of purchase, the Company will consolidate the results of Wynco in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and include all related assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Wynco 2003 revenues and operating income were $84,600 and $1,300, respectively.  Wynco results include approximately $11,600 derived from the purchase of products from the Company under an exclusive sales agency arrangement, and appr
oximately $1,300 derived from commissions for distribution of the Company's products. In March 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 100% interest in this distribution company, subject to normal closing conditions. The Company expects to approximately break even on the sale.</P>
