component support company providing repair and distribution services to the North American aftermarket primarily on behalf of European aircraft component manufacturers. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's Manufacturing segment activities include (i)&nbsp;the design, manufacture and installation of in-plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial
and military aircraft and helicopters, (ii)&nbsp;the design and manufacture of advanced composite materials for commercial, business and military aircraft, and (iii)&nbsp;the manufacture and
repair of a wide array of containers, pallets and shelters in support of military and humanitarian rapid deployment activities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
each of its reportable segments, the Company furnishes aviation products and services primarily through its own employees. The principal customers for the Company's products and
services in the Aircraft and Engines and Airframe and Accessories segments are domestic and foreign commercial airlines, regional/commuter airlines, business aircraft operators, aviation original
equipment manufacturers, aircraft leasing companies, domestic and foreign military organizations and independent aviation support companies. In the Manufacturing segment, principal customers include
domestic and foreign commercial airlines, aviation original equipment manufacturers and domestic and foreign military organizations. Sales of aviation products and services to commercial airlines are
generally affected by such factors as the number, type and average age of aircraft in service, the levels of aircraft utilization (e.g</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, frequency of
schedules), the number of airline operators and the level of sales of new and used aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition
in the worldwide aviation/aerospace industry is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery and price. Competitors in
both aircraft and engine parts supply businesses include the original equipment manufacturers, commercial airlines, and other independent suppliers of parts and services. In certain of its leasing and
commercial jet aircraft and engine sales activities, the Company faces competition from financial institutions, syndicators, commercial and specialized leasing companies and other entities that
provide financing. AAR also competes with various repair and overhaul organizations, which include the service arms of original equipment manufacturers, the maintenance departments or divisions of
large commercial airlines (some of which also offer maintenance services to third parties) and independent organizations. AAR's pallet, container and shelter manufacturing activities compete with
several modest-sized private companies, and its cargo systems competitors include a number of divisions of large corporations. Although certain of the Company's competitors have substantially greater
financial and other resources than the Company, the Company believes that it has maintained a satisfactory competitive position through its responsiveness to customer needs, its attention to quality
and its unique combination of market expertise, technical capabilities and financial strength. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
May&nbsp;31, 2001, backlog believed to be firm was approximately $74,100 compared to $79,800 at May&nbsp;31, 2000. An additional $7,000 of unfunded government options on
awarded contracts also existed at May&nbsp;31, 2001. It is expected that approximately $73,700 of the May&nbsp;31, 2001 backlog will be shipped in fiscal 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
to the U.S. Government, its agencies and its contractors were approximately $139,072 (15.9% of total sales), $132,048 (12.9% of total sales) and $98,954 (9.4% of total sales) in
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Because such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at levels
previously experienced. The majority of the Company's government contracts are for aviation products and services used for ongoing routine military logistic support activities; unlike weapons systems
and other high-technology military requirements, these products and services are less likely to be affected by reductions in defense spending. The Company's contracts with the U.S.
Government and its agencies are typically firm agreements to provide aviation products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or
more additional periods of one year at the option of the government agency. Although the Company's government contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government, in the event of
such a termination the Company would be entitled to recover from the government all allowable costs incurred by the Company through the date of termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Three-Year Sales Summary  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three fiscal years, consolidated sales, excluding pass through sales, decreased from $918,036 in fiscal 1999 to $853,659 in fiscal 2001. Total
sales, which include pass through sales, decreased from $1,050,608 in fiscal 1999 to $874,255 in fiscal 2001. The decline in sales from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2001 was primarily the result of lower
sales from engine parts inventory management programs to a major customer, resulting in a decrease in the Company's Aircraft and Engines sales from $416,099 in fiscal 1999 to $337,192 in fiscal 2001.
The sales decline was also influenced by a decline in airline profitability during the three-year period as a result of an overall economic slowdown and higher fuel prices. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
engine parts inventory management programs with a major customer supported older technology JT8D and JT9D engine families which are being phased out of the world airlines' fleets,
resulting in softer demand for the spare parts required to maintain these engine types. As demand for these parts by this major customer decreased, the justification for carrying a
just-in-time exclusive parts support arrangement became less viable and the program was dissolved by

sales decline over the three-year period in the Aircraft and Engines segment was partially offset by a sales increase in the Airframe and Accessories segment from
$376,356 in fiscal 1999 to $419,313 in fiscal 2001. This increase was the result of new aircraft component repair capability and capacity in both the commercial airline and military aviation markets,
and additional penetration of the landing gear overhaul market, including the relatively fast-growing regional aircraft market. In addition, the sales increase from fiscal 2000 to fiscal
2001 reflects the favorable impact of the acquisition of Hermetic in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Manufacturing segment declined from $125,581 in fiscal 1999 to $97,154 in fiscal 2001 primarily as a result of reduced demand for the Company's rapid deployment products
supporting the U.S. Government, and also the divestiture of the Company's floor maintenance products manufacturing facility in fiscal 1999. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although commercial airline profitability has significantly declined over the past three years, worldwide air traffic growth, the primary underlying long-term growth
factor in the Company's commercial markets, continues to expand, creating future opportunities for the Company. The Company believes that its established position as the leading independent provider
of value-added aviation products and services to the worldwide aviation/aerospace industry will enable it to take advantage of continuing market opportunities.* </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated sales in fiscal 2001, excluding pass through sales, decreased $103,866 or 10.8% compared to the prior year as the Company experienced lower sales
in the Aircraft and Engines and Manufacturing segments, partially offset by increased sales in the Airframe and Accessories segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Aircraft and Engines segment, fiscal 2001 sales declined $103,093 or 23.4% compared to fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of lower revenue in the Company's aircraft sales
business and lower sales of engine parts and components. The decline in aircraft sales is mainly due to the type of aircraft sold in the current year compared to the prior year. The decline in engine
parts sales was primarily the result of reduced demand by a major customer for certain engine parts due principally to fewer engine shop visits to this customer for the engine types the Company
supports, and from the impact of converting the Company's exclusive engine parts support agreement with this major customer to preferred status, which occurred in December&nbsp;2000. The reduction
in pass through sales of $46,212 also was attributable to these factors. Because the exclusive engine parts support agreements with this major customer were dissolved, in future periods the Company
does not believe it will have pass through sales.* </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Airframe and Accessories segment, fiscal 2001 sales increased over the prior year $22,006 or 5.5% primarily as a result of higher sales of airframe parts and from the favorable
impact of the acquisition of Hermetic, which the Company acquired on September&nbsp;29, 2000. Fiscal 2001 revenues for Hermetic included in consolidated sales were approximately $13,100. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Manufacturing segment, fiscal 2001 sales declined $22,779 or 19.0% compared to fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of lower sales of products supporting the U.S. Government's
rapid deployment program, and lower sales of the Company's cargo systems and composite structure products. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated
gross profit decreased $36,386 or 21.1% over the prior year due to the impact of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin. The decline in the
gross profit margin was attributable to lower margins in the Aircraft and Engines segment due to pricing pressure on older technology engine parts and reduced demand from a major inventory management
program customer. Gross profit margins were also lower in the Manufacturing segment reflecting lower demand for certain of the Company's manufactured products. The consolidated gross profit margin was
also negatively impacted by a $5,400 provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to adjust certain inventories previously used to support the major program customer to their net realizable
value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling,
general and administrative costs declined $6,118 or 6.0% reflecting lower personnel costs as the Company reduced its cost structure in response to more difficult industry
conditions. Selling, general and administrative expense declined also as a result of lower bad debt expense in fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year. Interest expense decreased $1,544 principally as
a result of reduced average short-term borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2001. Interest income declined $582 as a result of the reduction in average outstanding interest-bearing trade
notes receivable during the current year compared to the prior year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 was 8.4% compared to 29.0% for fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision for income taxes
includes a reduction in income tax expense of $3,300. This adjustment represents the reversal of Federal and state income tax liabilities for years prior to fiscal 1998, now closed to assessments. </FONT></P>

higher demand in both the Aircraft and Engines and Airframe and Accessories segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Aircraft and Engines segment, sales increased $24,186 or 5.8% as the Company experienced strong demand for its whole engine and aircraft products, partially offset by a
continued decrease in sales from engine parts inventory management programs. This decrease was primarily the result of reduced demand by a major customer for certain engine parts due principally to
significantly fewer engine shop visits to this customer for the engine types the Company supported. Pass through sales were $66,808 compared to $132,572 in the prior year. As certain of the Company's
inventory management programs matured, pass through sales declined as the Company sourced more of its customer's parts requirements with used serviceable parts, rather than with
factory-new parts. The reduction in pass through sales during the fiscal year is attributable to the maturation of the Company's long-term inventory management programs, as
well as a decline in the number of shop visits for the engine types the Company supports at certain long-term inventory management programs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Airframe and Accessories segment increased $20,951 or 5.6% reflecting increased demand for the Company's aircraft maintenance and component overhaul and repair services.
These increases were partially offset by lower new aircraft parts sales to general aviation customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Manufacturing segment, sales declined $5,648 or 4.5% as a result of the divestiture of the Company's floor maintenance products manufacturing subsidiary in
November&nbsp;1998, partially offset by higher sales of the Company's products supporting the U.S. Government's deployment needs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated
gross profit was essentially even with the prior fiscal year. The fiscal 2000 consolidated gross profit margin, excluding the impact from pass through sales, was 18.1%,
compared to 18.9% in fiscal 1999. The decrease in the gross profit margin can be attributed to lower margins in the Aircraft and Engines segment due to the unfavorable impact of the mix of inventories
sold. Gross profit margins increased in the Airframe and Accessories segment principally due to increased demand for the Company's landing gear and component overhaul and repair services. </FONT></P>

general and administrative expenses increased $6,317 or 6.6% as a result of a $4,000 charge to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts in response to the Company's
accounts receivable exposure, which included two airlines that filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2000, as well as increased information technology costs incurred as a result of the
Company's e-business activities. Interest expense increased $4,864 principally as a result of increased average short-term borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2000

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Aircraft and Engines segment increased $76,800 or 22.6% resulting from higher sales of engine parts, driven primarily from strength in inventory management programs, and
increased aircraft sales and leasing revenues. These increases were partially offset by the impact of certain engine parts sales which were recorded by Turbine Engine Asset Management L.L.C. (an
unconsolidated joint venture company) during fiscal 1999, but were recorded by the Aircraft and Engines segment during the first half of fiscal 1998. Pass through sales were $132,572 compared to
$74,514 in fiscal 1998. The increase in pass through sales in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 was attributable to the addition of new inventory management programs during fiscal 1999 and late
fiscal 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Airframe and Accessories segment increased $43,073 or 12.9% driven primarily by the impact of full-year sales from the new-parts distribution
companies acquired during fiscal 1998, as well as increased demand for aircraft maintenance and landing gear overhaul repair capabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Manufacturing segment increased $16,040 or 14.6% due to increased sales of products supporting the U.S. Government's rapid deployment program, the inclusion of
full-year sales from AAR Composites (acquired in fiscal 1998) and higher sales of cargo handling systems. These gains were partially offset by the unfavorable impact on sales as a result
of the divestiture of the Company's floor maintenance products manufacturing subsidiary in November&nbsp;1998. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated
gross profit increased $24,853 or 16.7% due to increased consolidated net sales. The fiscal 1999 consolidated gross profit margin of 18.9%, excluding the impact of pass
through sales, is slightly less than the consolidated gross profit margin of 19.0% in fiscal 1998. The gross profit margin in the Aircraft and Engines segment remained flat, while the gross profit
margin increased in the Company's Manufacturing segment primarily due to increased demand for cargo handling systems. The gross profit margin in the Airframe and Accessories segment declined due to
the mix of inventories sold. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling,
general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of consolidated net sales; however, total expenses increased due to the impact from companies acquired during
fiscal 1998, as well as increased marketing support and information technology costs, which include Year 2000 compliance costs. Interest expense increased $4,073 or 28.1% over the prior year primarily
due to the full-year effect of the $60,000 of unsecured 6.875% Notes issued in December&nbsp;1997. </FONT></P>

May&nbsp;31, 2001, the Company's long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio was 34.6% compared to 34.9% at May&nbsp;31, 2000, and the Company's total
debt-to-capitalization ratio was 36.3% at May&nbsp;31, 2001 compared to 38.1% at May&nbsp;31, 2000. The reduction in the total
debt-to-capitalization ratio was due to lower short-term borrowings outstanding at May&nbsp;31, 2001 compared to May&nbsp;31, 2000. The Company continues to
maintain its external sources of financing including $125,000 of unused available committed bank lines, and a universal shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under
which up to $200,000 of common stock, preferred stock or medium- or long-term debt securities may be issued or sold subject to market conditions, and an accounts receivable securitization

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuating interest rates under its unsecured bank credit agreements and foreign exchange rates. During
fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company did not utilize derivative financial instruments to offset these risks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
May&nbsp;31, 2001, $125,000 ($100,000 available through February&nbsp;9, 2003 and $25,000 available through April&nbsp;10, 2002) was available under credit lines with
domestic banks under revolving credit and term loan agreements, and $2,700 was available under credit agreements with foreign banks (credit facilities). Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit
facilities is LIBOR based. As of May&nbsp;31, 2001, the outstanding balance under these agreements was $0. A hypothetical 10&nbsp;percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit
facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during fiscal 2001 would have reduced the Company's pre-tax income by approximately $482 during fiscal 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues
and expenses of the Company's foreign operations in The Netherlands are translated at average exchange rates during the year and balance sheet accounts are translated at
year-end exchange rates. Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). A hypothetical 10&nbsp;percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would not have a material impact on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AAR CORP. and subsidiaries as of May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May&nbsp;31, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AAR CORP. and subsidiaries as of
May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May&nbsp;31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of Business  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAR CORP. (the Company) supplies a variety of products and services to the worldwide aviation/aerospace industry. Products and services are sold primarily to
commercial, domestic and foreign airlines; business aircraft operators; aviation original equipment manufacturers; aircraft leasing companies; domestic and foreign military agencies and independent
aviation support companies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Principles of Consolidation  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue Recognition  </I></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales and related cost of sales for product sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Service revenues and the related cost of services are generally
recognized when customer-owned material is shipped. Lease revenues are recognized as earned. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with certain long-term inventory management programs, the Company purchases factory-new products on behalf of its customers from original
equipment manufacturers. These products are purchased from the manufacturer and "passed through" to the Company's customer at the Company's cost. During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.&nbsp;101 summarizing the SEC's view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition. As a result of SAB No.&nbsp;101, the
Company began reporting pass through sales in the consolidated income statement beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2000. Prior to SAB No.&nbsp;101, the Company believed that excluding pass
through sales from sales was appropriate given the limited nature of the services provided in connection with these transactions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;New Accounting Standards  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards) No.&nbsp;133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2000. SFAS No.&nbsp;133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for certain hedging activities. It requires that an entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;133 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results
of operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
July&nbsp;2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141 "Business Combinations" and SFAS No.&nbsp;142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS
No.&nbsp;141 requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method. SFAS No.&nbsp;142 eliminated the amortization of goodwill and also requires that goodwill be tested
for impairment. SFAS No.&nbsp;141 is effective for business combinations after June&nbsp;30, 2001. SFAS No.&nbsp;142 is required for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2001. Early
adoption is permitted for companies with a fiscal year beginning after March&nbsp;2001, provided that the first quarter financial statements have not previously been issued. Because the Company
expects to adopt these statements effective with the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company will not have goodwill amortization after fiscal 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and Cash Equivalents  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, cash
equivalents of approximately $139 and $122, respectively, represent investments in funds holding U.S. Government agency-issued securities. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair
value at May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of Financial Assets  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"
which requires the Company to recognize the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, and to derecognize financial assets when control has been surrendered. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries, a special purpose entity, has an agreement (securitization) with a major financial institution to sell an undivided interest in its
accounts receivable up to $35,000. The agreement involves the sale of accounts receivable by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries to the special purpose entity which in turn sells the

May&nbsp;31, 2001, accounts receivable sold under the program were $30,455, and the cash proceeds from the transaction were $18,984. This resulted in a $18,984 reduction in
accounts receivable on the May&nbsp;31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet. At May&nbsp;31, 2000, accounts receivable sold under the program were $42,218 and the cash proceeds were $29,359. This
resulted in a $29,359 reduction in accounts receivable on the May&nbsp;31, 2000 consolidated balance sheet. The retained undivided interest of $11,471 and $12,859 as of May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, are included in accounts receivable at fair value, which takes into consideration expected credit losses based on the specific identification of uncollectable accounts. Since
substantially all accounts receivable sold carry 30&nbsp;day payment terms, the retained interest is not discounted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company acts as an equity participant in leveraged lease transactions. The equipment cost in excess of equity contribution is financed by third parties in
the form of secured debt. Under the lease agreements, the third parties have no recourse against the Company for nonpayment of the obligations. The third-party debt is collateralized by the lessees'
rental obligations and the leased equipment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost in excess of underlying net assets of acquired companies is being amortized over a period of 40&nbsp;years. The increase in cost in excess of
underlying net assets of acquired companies at May&nbsp;31, 2001 is attributable to the acquisition of Hermetic during fiscal 2001. Amortization expense was $1,249, $1,213 and $802 in fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Accumulated amortization is $7,437 and $6,188 at May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See New Accounting Standards section of this note for a description of SFAS
No.&nbsp;142, which will result in no amortization of goodwill after fiscal 2001. The Company evaluates the existence of impairment on the basis of whether the cost in excess of underlying net
assets of acquired companies is fully recoverable from projected, undiscounted net cash flows. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is subject to a number of covenants under the revolving credit and term loan agreements, including restrictions which relate to the payment of cash dividends, maintenance
of minimum net working capital and tangible net worth levels, sales of assets, additional financing, purchase of the Company's shares and other matters. The Company is in compliance with all
restrictive financial provisions of the agreements. At May&nbsp;31, 2001, unrestricted consolidated retained earnings available for payment of dividends and purchase of the Company's shares was
approximately $27,783. Effective June&nbsp;1, 2001, unrestricted consolidated retained earnings increased to $37,049 due to inclusion of 50% of the consolidated net income of the Company for fiscal
2001. The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing during each of the next five fiscal years is $65,410 in 2002, $394 in 2003, $51,406 in 2004, $284 in 2005 and $289 in 2006. The
Company's long-term debt was estimated to have a fair value of approximately $180,285 at May&nbsp;31, 2001 and was based on estimates using discounted future cash flows at an assumed
rate for borrowings currently prevailing in the marketplace for similar instruments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fiscal 2001 provision for income taxes includes a reduction in income tax expense of $3,300. This adjustment represents the reversal of Federal and state income tax liabilities
for years prior to fiscal 1998, now closed to assessments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Common Stock and Stock Option Plans  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has established stock option plans for officers and key employees of the Company. Stock option awards typically expire ten years from the date of
grant or earlier upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on successive grant anniversary dates at the New York Stock Exchange closing stock price on the date of
grant and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals, stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company accounts for these plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized. Pro forma information regarding net income
and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123. The fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock awards. Restrictions are released at the end of applicable restricted periods. The number of shares
and the restricted period, which varies from three to ten years, are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. At the date of grant, the market value of the award (based on
the New York Stock Exchange closing price) is recorded in common stock and capital surplus; an offsetting amount is recorded as a component of stockholders' equity in unearned restricted stock awards.
Compensation cost is included in results of operations over the vesting period. The expense relating to outstanding restricted stock awards was $1,055, $1,354 and $1,667 in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. </FONT></P>

to a shareholder rights plan adopted in 1997, each outstanding share of the Company's common stock carries with it a Right to purchase one and one half additional shares at a
price of $83.33 per share (adjusted to reflect the February&nbsp;23, 1998 stock split and subject to further antidilution adjustments). The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares)
when certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock by a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer for 15%
or more of the common stock. </FONT></P>

the event that an Acquiring Person acquires 15% or more of the common stock, or if the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger involving an Acquiring Person or if the Acquiring Person
engages in certain types of self-dealing transactions, each Right entitles the holder to purchase, for $83.33 per share (or the then-current exercise price), shares of the
Company's common stock having a market value of $166.66 (or two times the exercise price), subject to certain exceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination or 50% or more of its assets or earning power is sold, each Right entitles the holder to purchase at the then-current exercise price that number of shares of common stock of
the surviving corporation having a market value of two times the exercise price. The Rights do not entitle the holder thereof to vote or to receive dividends. The Rights will expire on
August&nbsp;6, 2007, and may be redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right under certain circumstances. </FONT></P>

September&nbsp;21, 1990, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 1,500 shares (adjusted for the three-for-two stock split) of the
Company's common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. On October&nbsp;13, 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 1,500 additional
shares of the Company's common stock. As of May&nbsp;31, 2001, the Company had purchased 1,720 shares of its common stock on the open market under these programs at an average price of $14.09 per

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year plus, when their effect is dilutive, potentially issuable common stock consisting of shares subject to stock options.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share information for each of the years in the three-year period ended May&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Benefit Plans  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has defined contribution or defined benefit plans covering substantially all full-time domestic employees and certain employees in The
Netherlands. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Defined Benefit Plans  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2000, the pension plan for domestic salaried employees had benefit formulas primarily based on years of service and compensation.
Effective January&nbsp;1, 2000, the Company converted its existing defined benefit plan for substantially all domestic salaried employees to a cash balance pension plan. Under the cash balance
pension plan, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in an account that grows with annual pay-based credits and interest on the account balance. The pension benefit for
hourly employees is generally based on a fixed amount per year of service. The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;87 "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No.&nbsp;132
"Employer's Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" for all pension and postretirement plans. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's funding policy for domestic plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes and that is sufficient to meet
actuarially computed pension benefits. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date and for benefits expected to be earned in the future. The assets of the pension
plans are invested primarily in mutual funds, common stocks, investment grade bonds and U.S. Government obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
foreign operations of domestic subsidiaries also have pension plans. In most cases, the plans are defined benefit in nature. Assets of the plans are comprised of insurance
contracts. Benefit formulas are based generally on years of service and compensation. It is the policy of these subsidiaries to fund at least the minimum amounts required by local law and regulation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company provides its outside directors with benefits upon retirement on or after age 65 provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director. Benefits are
paid quarterly in cash in an amount equal to 25.0% of the annual retainer fee payable by the Company to active outside directors. Payment of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a
period equal to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to a maximum of ten years, or death, whichever occurs first. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company
terminated this plan for any new members of the Board of Directors elected after May&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company also provides supplemental retirement and profit sharing benefits for current and former executives and key employees to supplement benefits provided by the Company's
other benefit plans. The plans are not fully funded and may require funding in the event of a change in control of the Company as determined by the Company's Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended to qualify as a 401(k) plan under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees
may contribute up to 15.0% of their pretax compensation, subject to applicable regulatory limits. The Company may make matching contributions up to 6.0% of compensation. Participants vest on a
pro-rata basis in Company contributions during the first three years of employment. Expense charged to results of operations was $1,550, $1,634 and $1,491 in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees and retirees under a variety of plans. Generally these benefits are
contributory with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement plans are unfunded, and the Company has the right to modify or terminate any of these plans in the future, in certain
cases, subject to union bargaining agreements. In fiscal 1995, the Company completed termination of postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits attributable to future services of collective
bargaining and other domestic employees. </FONT></P>

2.       COMMITMENT OF THE BANK.

         2.1      REVOLVING LOANS.

                  (a) REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and in
         reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Borrower set
         forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Bank agrees to make
         such Revolving Loans at such times as the Borrower may from time to
         time request until, but not including, the Maturity Date, and in such
         amounts as the Borrower may from time to time request, provided,
         however, that the aggregate principal balance of all Revolving Loans
         outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Revolving Loan Commitment.
         Revolving Loans made by the Bank may be repaid and, subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof, borrowed again up to, but not including
         the Maturity Date unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise terminated
         or extended as provided in this Agreement. The Revolving Loans shall be
         used by the Borrower for general corporate needs of the Borrower.

                  (b) REVOLVING LOAN INTEREST AND PAYMENTS. Except as otherwise
         provided in this Section 2.1(b), the principal amount of the Revolving
         Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the Interest
         Rate. Accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of
         all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time which are Prime
         Loans, shall be due and payable monthly, in arrears, commencing on May
         1, 2001 and continuing on the first day of each calendar month
         thereafter, and on the Maturity Date. Accrued and unpaid interest on
         the unpaid principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from
         time to time which are LIBOR Loans shall be payable LIBOR on the last
         Business Day of each Interest Period, commencing on the first such date
         to occur after the date hereof, on the date of any principal repayment
         of a LIBOR Loan and on the Maturity Date; provided however, that
         interest on six month LIBOR borrowings shall be payable quarterly. Any
         amount of principal or interest on the Revolving Loans which is not
         paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
         otherwise, shall bear interest payable on demand at the Default Rate.

                  (c)      REVOLVING LOAN PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS.

                           (i) MANDATORY PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENTS. All Revolving
                  Loans hereunder shall be repaid by the Borrower on the
                  Maturity Date, unless payable sooner pursuant to the
                  provisions of this Agreement. In the event the aggregate
                  outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans hereunder
                  at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitment, the Borrower
                  shall, without notice or demand of any kind, immediately make
                  such repayments of the Revolving Loans or take such other
                  actions as shall be necessary to eliminate such excess.

                           (ii) OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may from time
                  to time prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part,
                  without any prepayment penalty whatsoever.

         2.2      ADDITIONAL LIBOR LOAN PROVISIONS.

                  (a) LIBOR LOAN PREPAYMENTS. Notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary contained herein, the principal balance of any LIBOR Loan may
         not be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. If, for any reason, a
         LIBOR Loan is paid prior to the last Business Day of any Interest
         Period, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank against any loss
         (including any loss on redeployment of the funds repaid), cost or
         expense incurred by the Bank as a result of such prepayment.

                  (b) LIBOR UNAVAILABILITY. If the Bank determines in good faith
         (which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error) prior
         to the commencement of any Interest Period that (i) United States
         dollar deposits of sufficient amount and maturity for funding any LIBOR
         Loan are not available to the Bank in the London Interbank Eurodollar
         market in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) by reason of
         circumstances affecting the London Interbank Eurodollar market,
         adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of
         interest to be applicable to the relevant LIBOR Loan, the Bank shall
         promptly notify the Borrower thereof and, so long as the foregoing
         conditions continue, a Revolving Loan may not be advanced as a LIBOR
         Loan thereafter. In addition, at the Borrower's option, each existing
         LIBOR Loan shall be immediately (i) converted to a Prime Loan on the
         last Business Day of the then existing Interest Period, or (ii) due and
         payable on the last Business Day of the then existing Interest Period,
         without further demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind, all
         of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                  (c) REGULATORY CHANGE. In addition, if, after the date hereof,
         a Regulatory Change shall, in the reasonable determination of the Bank,
         make it unlawful for the Bank to make or maintain the LIBOR Loans, then
         the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and Revolving Loans may not
         be advanced as a LIBOR Loan thereafter. In addition, at the Borrower's
         option, each existing LIBOR Loan shall be immediately (i) converted to
         a Prime Loan on the last Business Day of the then existing Interest
         Period or on such earlier date as required by law, or (ii) due and
         payable on the last Business Day of the then existing Interest Period
         or on such earlier date as required by law, all without further demand,
         presentment, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
         waived by the Borrower.

                  (d) LIBOR LOAN INDEMNITY. If any Regulatory Change shall (a)
         impose, modify or deem applicable any assessment, reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in
         or for the account of or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds or
         disbursements by, the Bank; (b) subject the Bank or any LIBOR Loan to
         any tax, duty, charge, stamp tax or fee or change the basis of taxation
         of payments to the Bank of principal or interest due from the Borrower
         to the Bank hereunder (other than a change in the taxation of the
         overall net income of the Bank); or (c) impose on the Bank any other
         condition regarding such LIBOR Loan or the Bank's funding thereof, and
         the Bank shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be
         conclusive, absent manifest error) that the result of the foregoing is
         to increase the cost to


                                       12
<Page>

         the Bank of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan or to reduce the
         amount of principal or interest received by the Bank hereunder, then
         the Borrower shall pay to the Bank, within 15 days of demand by the
         Bank, such additional amounts as the Bank shall, from time to time,
         determine are sufficient to compensate and indemnify the Bank for that
         portion of such increased cost or reduced amount attributable to
         making, funding and maintaining such LIBOR Loan.

         2.3 INTEREST AND FEE COMPUTATION; COLLECTION OF FUNDS. Except as
otherwise set forth herein, all interest and fees shall be calculated on the
basis of a year consisting of 360 days and shall be paid for the actual number
of days elapsed. Principal payments submitted in funds not immediately available
shall continue to bear interest until collected. If any payment to be made by
the Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall become due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
such extension of time shall be included in computing any interest in respect of
such payment.

         2.4 FEES. The Borrower further agrees to pay to the Bank the Facility
Fee for the period from the date hereof to and including the Maturity Date. The
Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in advance on the date hereof and on
each Payment Date thereafter. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section
2.4 shall survive the payment of the Advances and the termination of this
Agreement.

3.       CONDITIONS OF BORROWING.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Bank shall
not be required to disburse or make all or any portion of the Loans if any of

principal amount of the Revolving Loans advanced hereunder (ii) any unpaid
interest owing on the Revolving Loans, and (iii) all amounts repaid on the
Revolving Loans. The failure to record any such amount or any error in recording

5.       MANNER OF BORROWING.

         Each Revolving Loan shall be made available to the Borrower upon its
written request in the form of EXHIBIT B, from any person whose authority to so
act has not been revoked by the Borrower in writing previously received by the
Bank. Each Revolving Loan may be advanced either as a Prime Loan or a LIBOR
Loan, provided, however, that at any time and from time to time, the Borrower
may identify no more than five (5) Revolving Loans, which may be LIBOR Loans. A
request for a Prime Loan must be received by no later than 12:00 p.m. Chicago,
Illinois time, on the day it is to be funded. A request for a LIBOR Loan must be
(i) received by no later than 12:00 p.m. Chicago, Illinois time, two days before
the day it is to be funded, and (ii) in an amount equal to One Million and
00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) or a higher integral multiple of Five Hundred
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00). If for any reason the Borrower shall
fail to select timely an Interest Period for an existing LIBOR Loan, then such
LIBOR Loan shall be immediately converted to a Prime Loan on the last Business
Day of the then existing Interest Period, all without demand, presentment,
protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
The proceeds of each Prime Loan or LIBOR Loan shall be made available at the
office of the Bank by credit to the account of the Borrower or by other means
requested by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank.

         The Bank is authorized to rely on the telephonic, telecopy (including
facsimile copy) or telegraphic loan requests which the Bank believes in its good
faith judgment to emanate from a properly authorized representative of the
Borrower, whether or not that is in fact the case. The Borrower does hereby
irrevocably confirm, ratify and approve all such forms of loan requests referred
to in the aforementioned sentence and advances by the Bank in reasonable
reliance thereon and does hereby indemnify the Bank against losses and expenses
(including court costs, attorneys' and paralegals' fees) and shall hold the Bank
harmless with respect thereto.

(this "Agreement") as follows:

SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF NOTES.

The Tranche A1 Notes and the Tranche A2 Notes shall be substantially in the
forms set out in Exhibits 1-A and 1-B, respectively, with such changes
therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the Purchasers and the Company. Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references
to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule
or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.

SECTION 2. SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES.

         SECTION 2.1. SERIES 2001-A NOTES. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Company will issue and sell to each Purchaser and each

AAR Corp.                                               Note Purchase Agreement

         SECTION 2.2. ADDITIONAL SERIES OF NOTES. The Company may, from time to
time, in its sole discretion but subject to the terms hereof, issue and sell one
or more additional Series of its unsecured promissory notes under the provisions
of this Agreement pursuant to a supplement (a "SUPPLEMENT") substantially in
the form of Exhibit S. Each additional Series of Notes (the "ADDITIONAL NOTES")
issued pursuant to a Supplement shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

                  (i) each Series of Additional Notes, when so issued, shall be
         differentiated from all previous Series by sequential alphabetical
         designation inscribed thereon;

                  (ii) Additional Notes of the same Series may consist of more
         than one different and separate Tranches and may differ with respect to
         outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates, interest rates and
         premiums, if any, and price and terms of redemption or payment prior to
         maturity, but all such different and separate tranches of the same
         Series shall vote as a single class and constitute one Series;

                  (iii) each Series of Additional Notes shall be dated the date
         of issue, bear interest at such rate or rates, mature on such date or
         dates, be subject to such mandatory and optional prepayment on the
         dates and at the premiums, if any, have such additional or different
         conditions precedent to closing, such representations and warranties
         and such additional covenants as shall be specified in the Supplement
         under which such Additional Notes are issued and upon execution of any
         such Supplement, this Agreement shall be amended to reflect such
         additional covenants without further action on the part of the holders
         of the Notes outstanding under this Agreement, PROVIDED, that any such
         additional covenants shall inure to the benefit of all holders of Notes
         so long as any Additional Notes issued pursuant to such Supplement
         remain outstanding;

                  (iv) each Series of Additional Notes issued under this
         Agreement shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit 1 to Exhibit S
         hereto with such variations, omissions and insertions as are necessary
         or permitted hereunder;

                  (v) the minimum principal amount of any Note issued under a
         Supplement shall be $100,000, except as may be necessary to evidence
         the outstanding amount of any Note originally issued in a denomination
         of $100,000 or more;

                  (vi) all Additional Notes shall constitute Senior Debt of the
         Company and shall rank PARI PASSU with all other outstanding Notes; and

                  (vii) no Additional Notes shall be issued hereunder if at the
         time of issuance thereof and after giving effect to the application of
         the proceeds thereof, any Default or Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing.

SECTION 3. CLOSING.

         The sale and purchase of the Series 2001-A Notes to be purchased by
each Purchaser shall occur at the offices of Chapman and Cutler, 111 West Monroe

Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to any Purchaser's satisfaction, such
Purchaser shall, at such Purchaser's election, be relieved of all further
obligations under this Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights such
Purchaser may have by reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.

         The obligation of each Purchaser to purchase and pay for the Series
2001-A Notes to be sold to such Purchaser at the Closing is subject to the

or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Neither the Company

received all such counterpart originals or certified or other copies of such
documents as such Purchaser or such Purchaser's special counsel may reasonably

         holder of Notes an Officer's Certificate dated the date of issue of
         such Series of Additional Notes stating that such officer has reviewed

                  (b) EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF SUPPLEMENT. The Company and each
         such Additional Purchaser shall execute and deliver a Supplement
         substantially in the form of Exhibit S hereto.

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

         The Company represents and warrants to each Purchaser that:

         SECTION 5.1. ORGANIZATION; POWER AND AUTHORITY. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has the corporate power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties
it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts
and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Notes
and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof.

         SECTION 5.2. AUTHORIZATION, ETC. This Agreement and the Notes have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each
Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (ii) general


                                      -5-

<Page>

principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

         SECTION 5.3. DISCLOSURE. The Company, through its agent, Banc of
America Securities LLC, has delivered to each Purchaser a copy of a Private
Placement Memorandum, dated April 16, 2001 (the "MEMORANDUM"), relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all
material respects, the general nature of the business and principal properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The documents, certificates or other
writings delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial
statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which they were made. Except as disclosed in the financial statements listed in
Schedule 5.5, since May 31, 2000, there has been no change in the financial
condition, operations, business, properties or prospects of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries except changes that individually or in the aggregate could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact
Known to the Company that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.4. ORGANIZATION AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF SUBSIDIARIES;
AFFILIATES. (a) Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
correct lists (i) of the Company's Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
showing, as to each Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of
its organization, and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital
stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Company and each
other Subsidiary, (ii) of the Company's Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries,
(iii) of the Company's directors and senior officers and (iv) Investments
permitted pursuant to paragraph (d) of the definition of "Restricted
Investments".

         (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien
(except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).

         (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions
as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and
authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold
under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.

         (d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to, any legal
restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement and customary
limitations imposed by corporate law statutes) restricting the ability of such
Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar
distributions of profits to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns
outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of such
Subsidiary.

         SECTION 5.5. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has delivered to each
Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said financial statements (including in each case
the related schedules and notes) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates specified in such financial statements and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so
specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto
(subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments).

         SECTION 5.6. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER INSTRUMENTS, ETC. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
Notes will not (a) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or by-laws,
or other Material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any
of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (b) conflict with or
result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order,
judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority
applicable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (c) violate any
provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental
Authority applicable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary.

         SECTION 5.7. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC. No consent, approval or
authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental
Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
by the Company of this Agreement or the Notes.

         SECTION 5.8. LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF STATUTES AND ORDERS. (a) There
are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any
property of the Company or any Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator
of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that, individually or in
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any term
of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound,
or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or
Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule
or regulation (including without limitation Environmental Laws) of any
Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.9. TAXES. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax
returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid
all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and
assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises,
to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before
they have become delinquent, except for any returns or taxes and assessments (a)
the filing or amount of which is not individually or in the aggregate Material
or (b) the amount, applicability


                                      -7-

<Page>

or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case
may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. The Company
knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves
on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or
other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate. The Federal income tax
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service and paid for all fiscal years up to and including the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1997.

         SECTION 5.10. TITLE TO PROPERTY; LEASES. The Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective properties that
they own or purport to own and that individually or in the aggregate are
Material, including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited
balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and
clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that individually or in
the aggregate are Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and
effect in all Material respects. The property of Unrestricted Subsidiaries is
not material individually or in the aggregate in relationship to the property of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, and the aggregate cash
flow attributable to Unrestricted Subsidiaries is not material in relationship
to the cash flow of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

         SECTION 5.11. LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC.

                  (a) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries own or possess
         all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights,
         service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that
         individually or in the aggregate are Material, without Known conflict
         with the rights of others except for those conflicts, that,
         individually or in the aggregate, could not have a Material Adverse
         Effect;

                  (b) to the best Knowledge of the Company, no product of the
         Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries infringes in any Material
         respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent,
         copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by
         any other Person; and

                  (c) to the best Knowledge of the Company, there is no Material
         violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, service
         mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company
         or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 5.12. COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA. (a) The Company and each ERISA
Affiliate have operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all
applicable laws except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted
in and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant
to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code
relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA), and no
event, transaction or


                                      -8-

<Page>

condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in
the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or
in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of
ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or
412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or Liens as could not be
individually or in the aggregate Material.

         (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each
of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such
Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation
report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan
allocable to such benefit liabilities. The Company has no present intent to
terminate any Plan, and, accordingly, each Plan is evaluated as a continuing
Plan. The term "BENEFIT LIABILITIES" has the meaning specified in Section 4001
of ERISA and the terms "CURRENT VALUE" and "PRESENT VALUE" have the meanings
specified in Section 3 of ERISA.

         (c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal
liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities) under
Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer Plans that
individually or in the aggregate are Material.

         (d) Except as set forth in Note 6 to the Company's financial statements
for its fiscal year ended May 31, 2000, the expected post-retirement benefit
obligation (determined as of the last day of the Company's most recently ended
fiscal year in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 106, without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage
mandated by Section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
not Material.

         (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and
sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to
the prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could
be imposed pursuant to Section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation
by the Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance
upon and subject to the accuracy of each Purchaser's representation in Section
6.2 as to the sources of the funds to be used to pay the purchase price of the
Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser.

         SECTION 5.13. PRIVATE OFFERING BY THE COMPANY. Neither the Company nor
anyone acting on its behalf has, in the six months preceding Closing, offered
the Series 2001-A Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any
offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in
respect thereof with, any Person other than not more than 62 Institutional
Investors (including the Purchasers), each of which has been offered the Series
2001-A Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither the Company nor anyone
acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action that would subject the
issuance or sale of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of
the Securities Act.

         SECTION 5.14. USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS. The Company will
apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes to repay existing indebtedness of
the Company and its Restricted


                                      -9-

<Page>

Subsidiaries and to other general corporate purposes. No part of the proceeds
from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for
the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR
221), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities
under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation of Regulation
X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation
of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). The Company does not presently have,
and has no present intention to acquire, legal or beneficial ownership of any
margin stock. As used in this Section, the terms "MARGIN STOCK" and "PURPOSE OF
BUYING OR CARRYING" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation
U.

         SECTION 5.15. EXISTING DEBT; FUTURE LIENS. (a) Schedule 5.15 sets forth
a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries as of February 28, 2001, since which date there has been
no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment
payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in default
and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal
or interest on any Debt of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of which exceeds $5,000,000, and no event
or condition exists with respect to any Debt of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of which exceeds
$5,000,000, that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or
both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Debt to become due and
payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of
payment.

         (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither the Company nor any
Restricted Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future
(upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by
Section 10.4.

         SECTION 5.16. FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS, ETC. Neither the sale
of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the proceeds thereof will
violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets
control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle
B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order
relating thereto.

         SECTION 5.17. STATUS UNDER CERTAIN STATUTES. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is an "investment company" registered or required to be
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject
to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended,
the ICC Termination Act of 1995, as amended, or the Federal Power Act, as
amended.

         SECTION 5.18. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Neither the Company nor any
Restricted Subsidiary has Knowledge of any liability or has received any notice
of any liability, and no proceeding has been instituted raising any liability
against the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of their
respective real properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of
them or other assets, alleging any damage to the environment or violation of any
Environmental Laws,


                                      -10-

<Page>

except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect individually or in the aggregate. Except as otherwise
disclosed to you in writing:

                  (a) neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has
         Knowledge of any facts which would give rise to any liability, public
         or private, for violation of Environmental Laws or damage to the
         environment emanating from, occurring on or in any way related to real
         properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or
         to other assets or their use, except, in each case, such as could not
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (b) neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
         has stored any Hazardous Materials on real properties now or formerly
         owned, leased or operated by any of them or has disposed of any
         Hazardous Materials in a manner contrary to any Environmental Laws in
         each case in any manner that could reasonably be expected to result in
         a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (c) all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or
         operated by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries are in
         compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to
         comply could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect.

SECTION 6. REPRESENTATIONS OF EACH PURCHASER.

         SECTION 6.1. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT. Each Purchaser represents that it
has received a copy of the Memorandum and that it is purchasing the Series
2001-A Notes for its own account or for one or more separate accounts maintained
by it or for the account of one or more pension or trust funds and not with a
view to the distribution thereof, provided that the disposition of such
Purchaser's or such pension or trust funds' property shall at all times be
within such Purchaser's or such pension or trust funds' control. Each Purchaser
understands that the Series 2001-A Notes have not been registered under the
Securities Act and may be resold only if registered pursuant to the provisions
of the Securities Act or if an exemption from registration is available, except
under circumstances where neither such registration nor such an exemption is
required by law, and that the Company is not required to register the Series
2001-A Notes.

         SECTION 6.2. SOURCE OF FUNDS. Each Purchaser represents that at least
one of the following statements is an accurate representation as to each source
of funds (a "SOURCE") to be used by it to pay the purchase price of the Series
2001-A Notes to be purchased by it hereunder:

                  (a) the Source is an "insurance company general account"
         within the meaning of Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction
         Exemption ("PTE") 95-60 (issued July 12, 1995) and there is no employee
         benefit plan, treating as a single plan, all plans maintained by the
         same employer or employee organization, with respect to which the
         amount of the general account reserves and liabilities for all
         contracts held by or on behalf of such plan, exceeds ten percent (10%)
         of the total reserves and liabilities of such general account
         (exclusive of separate account liabilities) plus surplus, as set forth
         in the NAIC Annual Statement for such Purchaser most recently filed
         with such Purchaser's state of domicile; or


                                      -11-

<Page>

                  (b) the Source is either (i) an insurance company pooled
         separate account, within the meaning of PTE 90-1 (issued January 29,
         1990), or (ii) a bank collective investment fund, within the meaning of
         the PTE 91-38 (issued July 12, 1991) and, except as such Purchaser has
         disclosed to the Company in writing pursuant to this paragraph (b), no
         employee benefit plan or group of plans maintained by the same employer
         or employee organization beneficially owns more than 10% of all assets
         allocated to such pooled separate account or collective investment
         fund; or

                  (c) the Source constitutes assets of an "investment fund"
         (within the meaning of Part V of the QPAM Exemption) managed by a
         "qualified professional asset manager" or "QPAM" (within the meaning of

SECTION 8. PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

         SECTION 8.1. NO SCHEDULED PREPAYMENTS OF THE SERIES 2001-A NOTES. The
entire principal amount of each Tranche of the Series 2001-A Notes is payable at
their respective maturity dates.

         SECTION 8.2. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS WITH MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT. The Company
may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at any time all, or
from time to time any part of, the Notes of any Series, in an amount not less
than $5,000,000 in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal
amount so prepaid, together with interest accrued thereon to the date of such
prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with
respect to


                                      -16-

<Page>

such principal amount of each Note of the applicable Series then outstanding.
The Company will give each holder of Notes of the Series to be prepaid written
notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days
and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment. Each such
notice shall specify such date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and
each Series of Notes to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each
Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section
8.3), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such
principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a
Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection
with such prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of
the prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business
Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes
of the Series to be prepaid a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer
specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified
prepayment date.

         SECTION 8.3. ALLOCATION OF PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS. In the case of each
partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2, the
principal amount of the Notes of the Series to be prepaid shall be allocated
among all of the Notes of such Series at the time outstanding in proportion, as
nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof. All
regularly scheduled partial prepayments made with respect to each Tranche of any
Additional Series of Notes pursuant to any Supplement shall be allocated as
provided therein.

         SECTION 8.4. MATURITY; SURRENDER, ETC. In the case of each prepayment
of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to be
prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such
prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date
and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such date, unless
the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and payable,
together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest
on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full
shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and
no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

         SECTION 8.5. PURCHASE OF NOTES. The Company will not and will not
permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly
or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except (a) upon the payment or

(including any Supplement hereto) and the Notes or (b) pursuant to an offer to
purchase made by the Company or an Affiliate pro rata to the holders of all
Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. Any such offer
shall provide each holder with sufficient information to enable it to make an
informed decision with respect to such offer, and shall remain open for at least
20 Business Days. If the holders of more than 10% of the principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding accept such offer, the Company shall promptly notify the
remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for the acceptance by
holders of Notes of such offer shall be extended by the number of days necessary
to give each such remaining holder at least 10 Business Days from its receipt of
such notice to accept such offer. The Company will promptly cancel all Notes
acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or purchase
of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued
in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

         SECTION 8.6. MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT FOR SERIES 2001-A NOTES. The term
"MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT" means, with respect to any Series 2001-A Note, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled
Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of
such Called Principal, PROVIDED that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be
less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the
following terms have the following meanings:

                  "CALLED PRINCIPAL" means, with respect to any Series 2001-A
         Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to
         Section 8.2 or 8.7 or has become or is declared to be immediately due
         and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

                  "DISCOUNTED VALUE" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of any Series 2001-A Note, the amount obtained by discounting all
         Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from
         their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with
         respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial
         practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis
         as that on which interest on the Series 2001-A Notes is payable) equal
         to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.

                  "REINVESTMENT YIELD" means, with respect to the Called
         Principal of any Note, the sum of 0.5% plus the yield to maturity
         implied by (i) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City
         time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with
         respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "PX-1"
         on the Bloomberg Financial Market Screen (or such other display as may
         replace "PX-1" on the Bloomberg Financial Market Screen) for actively
         traded U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the
         Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement
         Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the
         yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable, the Treasury
         Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which
         such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day
         preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
         Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable
         successor publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities
         having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such
         Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be
         determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill

acceptances shall have been made. In the event that such Change in Control does
not occur on or before the Proposed Prepayment Date in respect thereof, the

satisfactory evidence that the Notes have been accorded a rating of Investment
Grade or better by both Rating Agencies, after giving effect on a pro forma
basis to the consummation of the Change in Control and all other events and

         most recently ended fiscal year of the Company.

If the Net Proceeds Amount for any Transfer is applied to a Debt Prepayment
Application or a Property Reinvestment Application within 365 days after such
Transfer, then such Transfer, only for the purpose of determining compliance

         of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia;

Corporation from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes.

permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business if, as a
result, the general nature of the business in which the Company and its

or another Restricted Subsidiary), except in the ordinary course and pursuant to
the reasonable requirements of the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's
business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the Company or

designation of any Subsidiary as Restricted or Unrestricted. Any Subsidiary

SECTION 12. REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

         SECTION 12.1. ACCELERATION. (a) If an Event of Default with respect to
the Company described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 has occurred, all
the Notes of every Series then outstanding shall automatically become
immediately due and payable.

         (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any
holder or holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Notes of any
Series at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by notice
or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes of such Series then outstanding
to be immediately due and payable.

         (c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of
Section 11 has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Series of Notes,
any holder or holders of Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of
Default may at any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the
Company, declare all the Notes of such Series held by it or them to be
immediately due and payable.

         Upon any Note's becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1,
whether automatically or by declaration, such Note will forthwith mature and the
entire unpaid principal amount of such Note, plus (i) all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such
principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be
immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or
are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.


                                      -30-

<Page>

         SECTION 12.2. OTHER REMEDIES. If any Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or
have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of
any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights
of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained
herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the
terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby
or thereby or by law or otherwise.

         SECTION 12.3. RESCISSION. At any time after any Notes of any Series
have been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section
12.1, the holders of not less than 50% in principal amount of the Notes of such
Series then outstanding, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul
any such declaration and its consequences as to such Series if (a) the Company
has paid all overdue interest on the Notes of such Series, all principal of and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes of such Series that are due and payable
and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on
such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes of
such Series, at the Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other
than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c)
no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due
pursuant hereto or to any Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section
12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

         SECTION 12.4. NO WAIVERS OR ELECTION OF REMEDIES, EXPENSES, ETC. No
course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in
exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall
be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein
or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the Company
will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any
enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.

SECTION 13. REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

         SECTION 13.1. REGISTRATION OF NOTES. The Company shall keep at its
principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of
transfers of Notes, maintained separately by Series and Tranche. The name and
address of each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name
and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such
register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in
whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner
and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be
affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to
any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request
therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all
registered holders of Notes.

         SECTION 13.2. TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES. Upon surrender of any
Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of
transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of
transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly
executed by the registered holder of such Note or its attorney duly authorized
in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such
Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver, at the Company's
expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the
holder thereof) of an identical Series (and of an identical Tranche if such
Series has separate Tranches) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such
new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be
substantially in the form of the Note of such Series and Tranche originally
issued hereunder or pursuant to any Supplement. Each such new Note shall be
dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on
the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest
shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of
any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of
less than $250,000, PROVIDED that if necessary to enable the registration of
transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes in a Series or Tranche, one
Note may be in a denomination of less than $250,000. Any transferee, by its
acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall
be deemed to have made the representation set forth in Section 6.2, PROVIDED
that such holder may (in reliance upon information provided by the Company,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld) make a representation to the effect
that the purchase by such holder of any Note will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406(a) of ERISA.

         SECTION 13.3. REPLACEMENT OF NOTES. Upon receipt by the Company of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of
an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such
ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and

                  (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
         reasonably satisfactory to it (PROVIDED that if the holder of such Note
         is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a
         Note with a minimum net worth of at least $1,000,000, such Person's own
         unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory),
         or

                  (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
         thereof,

the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new
Note of an identical Series (and of an identical Tranche if such Series has
separate Tranches), dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest
shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated
the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall
have been paid thereon.

Chicago, Illinois at the principal office of Bank of America in such
jurisdiction. The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note,
change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall
be either the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the
principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.

         SECTION 14.2. HOME OFFICE PAYMENT. So long as any Purchaser or such
Purchaser's nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding
anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company
will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if
any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose
for such Purchaser on Schedule A hereto or Schedule A attached to any
Supplement, or by such other method or at such other address as such Purchaser
shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such
purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any
notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made
concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of
any Note, such Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably
promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive
office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company
pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note
held by any Purchaser or such Purchaser's nominee such Purchaser will, at its
election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the
last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the
Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The
Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional
Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note.

SECTION 15. EXPENSES, ETC.

         SECTION 15.1. TRANSACTION EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company will pay all reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of one special counsel)
incurred by the Purchasers and each other holder of a Note in connection with
such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents
under or in respect of this Agreement (including any Supplement) or the Notes
(whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective), including,
without limitation: (a) the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing or
defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under
this Agreement (including any Supplement) or the Notes or in responding to any
subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in
connection with this Agreement (including any Supplement) or the Notes, or by
reason of being a holder of any Note, and (b) the costs and expenses, including
financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Company or any Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out
or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The
Company will pay, and will save each Purchaser and each other holder of a Note
harmless from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of
brokers and finders (other than those retained by the Purchasers).

         SECTION 15.2. SURVIVAL. The obligations of the Company under this
Section 15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement,
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, any Supplement or the

SECTION 16. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT .

         All representations and warranties contained herein or in any
Supplement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, such
Supplement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer by any Purchaser or any
Additional Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and may
be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any
Additional Purchaser or any other holder of a Note. All statements contained in
any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement or any Supplement shall be deemed representations and
warranties of the Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement (including every Supplement) and the Notes embody the
entire agreement and understanding between the Purchasers and the Additional
Purchasers and the Company and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
relating to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 17. AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

         SECTION 17.1. REQUIREMENTS. (a) This Agreement (including any
Supplement) and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof
or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and
only with) the written consent of the Company and the holders of Notes holding
more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of all Series at the
time outstanding, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof, or any defined term (as it
is used therein), will be effective as to any Purchaser unless consented to by
such Purchaser in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the
written consent of the all of the holders of Notes of any Tranche at the time
outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12
relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any
prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of
payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the
Notes of such Tranche, (ii) change the percentage of the principal amount of the
Notes of such Tranche, the holders of such Tranche which are required to consent
to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b),
12, 17 or 20.

         (b) SUPPLEMENTS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company may enter into any Supplement providing for the issuance of
one or more Series of Additional Notes consistent with Sections 2.2 and 4.11
hereof without obtaining the consent of any holder of any other Series of Notes.

         SECTION 17.2. SOLICITATION OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

         (a) SOLICITATION. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes
(irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient
information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to
enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to
any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions
hereof, any Supplement or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or
true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes
promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or
receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.


                                      -34-

<Page>

         (b) PAYMENT. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause
to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional
interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of Notes as
consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of
Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof or
any Supplement unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is
concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then
outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.

         SECTION 17.3. BINDING EFFECT, ETC. Any amendment or waiver consented to
as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is
binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Company
without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment
or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation,
covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived
or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company
and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or
under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such
Note. As used herein, the term "this Agreement" and references thereto shall
mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

         SECTION 17.4. NOTES HELD BY COMPANY, ETC. Solely for the purpose of
determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any
amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or
have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be
taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes of such Tranche or Series then outstanding,
Notes of such Tranche or Series directly or indirectly owned by the Company or
any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

SECTION 18. NOTICES.

         All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing and sent (a) by telefacsimile if the sender on the same day sends a
confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service
(charges prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested (postage prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service
(with charges prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:

                  (i) if to a Purchaser or such Purchaser's nominee, to such
         Purchaser or such Purchaser's nominee at the address specified for such
         communications in Schedule A to this Agreement or any Supplement, or at
         such other address as such Purchaser or such Purchaser's nominee shall
         have specified to the Company in writing,

                  (ii) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at
         such address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company
         in writing, or


                                      -35-

<Page>

                  (iii) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set
         forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of Chief Financial
         Officer, or at such other address as the Company shall have specified
         to the holder of each Note in writing.

Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when actually received.

SECTION 19. REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

         This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without
limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by each Purchaser at the Closing (except the
Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other
information previously or hereafter furnished to each Purchaser, may be
reproduced by such Purchaser by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm,
microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and such Purchaser
may destroy any original document so reproduced. The Company agrees and
stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such
reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any
judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such Purchaser in the
regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further
reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This
Section 19 shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from
contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the
original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such
reproduction.

SECTION 20. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         For the purposes of this Section 20, "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" means
information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement that is confidential or proprietary in nature and
that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when
received by such Purchaser as being confidential information of the Company or
such Subsidiary, PROVIDED that such term does not include information that
(a) was publicly known or otherwise known to such Purchaser prior to the time
of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or
omission by such Purchaser or any Person acting on such Purchaser's behalf,
(c) otherwise becomes known to such Purchaser from any Person not subject to a
confidentiality obligation or in violation thereof other than through disclosure
by the Company or any Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements
delivered to such Purchaser under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly
available. Each Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential
Information in accordance with procedures adopted by such Purchaser in good
faith to protect confidential information of third parties delivered to such
Purchaser, PROVIDED that such Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential
Information to (i) such Purchaser's directors, trustees, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably
relates to the administration of the investment represented by such Purchaser's
Notes), (ii) such Purchaser's financial advisors and other professional advisors
who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in
accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii) any other holder of any
Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which such Purchaser sells or offers to
sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation


                                      -36-

<Page>

therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such
Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (v)
any Person from which such Purchaser offers to purchase any security of the
Company (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such
Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi)
any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such
Purchaser, (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any
similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires
access to information about such Purchaser's investment portfolio, or (viii) any
other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or
appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, Rule, regulation or order
applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal
process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which such Purchaser is a
party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the
extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to
be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
rights and remedies under such Purchaser's Notes and this Agreement. Each holder
of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were
a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection
with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be
delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other
than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder
will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this
Section 20.

SECTION 21. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

         Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of such
Purchaser's Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has
agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice
shall be signed by both such Purchaser and such Purchaser's Affiliate, shall
contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall
contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of
the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such notice,
wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in this Agreement (other than in this
Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of
such Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a
purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such Purchaser
all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of
notice of such transfer, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in this Agreement
(other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to
such Affiliate, but shall refer to such Purchaser, and such Purchaser shall have
all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.

SECTION 22. MISCELLANEOUS.

         SECTION 22.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement (including all covenants and other
agreements contained in any Supplement) by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns
(including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so
expressed or not.


                                      -37-

<Page>

         SECTION 22.2. PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS. Anything in this
Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal
of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than
a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without
including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable
on such next succeeding Business Day.

         SECTION 22.3. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law)
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 22.4. CONSTRUCTION. Each covenant contained herein shall be
construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of
each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant
shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse
compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action
to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such
provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or
indirectly by such Person.

         SECTION 22.5. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which
together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a
number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by
all, of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 22.6. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by,
the law of the State of Illinois excluding choice-of-law principles of the law
of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction
other than such State.

The execution hereof by the Purchasers shall constitute a contract among the
Company and the Purchasers for the uses and purposes hereinabove set forth. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each executed
counterpart constituting an original but all together only one agreement.

                        FORM OF OPINION OF SENIOR COUNSEL
                                 TO THE COMPANY

      The closing opinion of Donald J. Vilim, Esq., Senior Counsel to the
Company, which is called for by Section 4.4 of the Note Purchase Agreement,
shall be dated the date of Closing and addressed to the Purchasers, shall be
satisfactory in scope and form to each Purchaser and shall be to the effect
that:

       1. The Company is a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has the
corporate power and the corporate authority to execute and perform the Note
Purchase Agreement and to issue the Series 2001-A Notes and, to such counsel's
knowledge, each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. The
Company has the full corporate power and the corporate authority to conduct the
activities in which it is now engaged. The Company and each Subsidiary are duly
licensed or qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business transacted by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

       2. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each such
Subsidiary have been duly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are
owned by the Company, by one or more Subsidiaries, or by the Company and one or
more Subsidiaries.

       3. The Note Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding contract
of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether the
application of such principles is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

       4. The Series 2001-A Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, have been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether the application of such principles is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

       5. The issuance and sale of the Series 2001-A Notes and the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of the Note Purchase Agreement will not
violate or result in any breach of any of the provisions of or constitute a
default under or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of
the property of the Company pursuant to the provisions of any agreement or other
instrument which has been filed as an exhibit to AAR's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the period ended May 31, 2000 or any subsequent Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the date
hereof.

       6. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, threatened against or affecting the
Company or any Subsidiary before any Governmental Authority or arbitration board
or tribunal which, if adversely determined, would have a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of such counsel, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is in default with respect to any court or governmental authority, or
arbitration board or tribunal.

      The opinion of Senior Counsel to the Company shall cover such other
matters relating to the sale of the Series 2001-A Notes as each Purchaser may
reasonably request. With respect to matters of fact on which such opinion is
based, such counsel shall be entitled to rely on appropriate certificates of
public officials and other officers of the Company.

      The closing opinion of Chapman and Cutler, special counsel to the
Purchasers, called for by Section 4.4 of the Note Purchase Agreement, shall be
dated the date of Closing and addressed to each Purchaser, shall be satisfactory
in form and substance to each Purchaser and shall be to the effect that:

corporate action on the part of the Company, has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding contract
of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,

application of such principles is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

       3. The Series 2001-A Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, and the Series 2001-A Notes being
delivered on the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally,
and general principles of equity (regardless of whether the application of such
principles is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

       4. The issuance, sale and delivery of the Series 2001-A Notes under the
circumstances contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement do not, under existing
law, require the registration of the Series 2001-A Notes under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

      The opinion of Chapman and Cutler shall also state that the opinion of
Schiff Hardin & Waite, special counsel to the Company, and the opinion of Donald
J. Vilim, Esq., Senior Counsel to the Company, are satisfactory in scope and
form to Chapman and Cutler and that, in their opinion, the Purchasers are
justified in relying thereon. With respect to matters of fact upon which such
opinion is based, Chapman and Cutler may rely on appropriate certificates of
public officials and officers of the Company and upon representations of the
Company and the Purchasers delivered in connection with the issuance and sale of
the Series 2001-A Notes.

      In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph 1 above, Chapman and
Cutler may rely, as to matters referred to in paragraph 1, solely upon an
examination of the Certificate of Incorporation certified by, and a certificate
of good standing of the Company from, the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, the Bylaws of the Company and the general business corporation law of
the State of Delaware. The opinion of Chapman and Cutler is limited to the laws
of the State of Illinois, the general business corporation law of the State of
Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States.

                      AAR CORP. Directors' Retirement Plan


         WHEREAS, AAR CORP. ("Company") adopted the AAR CORP. Directors'
Retirement Plan ("Plan") effective April 14, 1992; and

         WHEREAS, the Company reserved the right to amend or terminate the Plan
at any time and from time to time, provided, however, that no such amendment or
termination shall reduce accrued retirement benefits for participants under the
Plan; and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan in certain respects and
to terminate the Plan prospectively effective April 10, 2001, except as
otherwise provided for below;

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby amends and terminates the Plan as
set forth below, effective as of April 10, 2001:

     1.   Any individual who was a Director on April 9, 2001, and who was not

          Participant under the Plan. The rights of a grandfathered Participant
          to receive benefits under the Plan in accordance with Plan provisions
          shall survive termination of the Plan and such benefits shall be
          determined without regard to whether the grandfathered Participant's
          Years of Service are completed before or after termination of the
          Plan.

     2.   The Plan is hereby terminated effective April 10, 2001, subject to the
          rights of (i) all vested Participants and (ii) all Participants who

          continue to receive benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan as the
          Plan was in effect from time to time prior to such termination and
          applicable to such Participant.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be
executed in its name by its duly authorized officer as of the 10th day of April,
2001.

                               Amendment No. 1 to
                         AAR CORP. Amended and Restated
                    SUPPLEMENTAL KEY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN


     WHEREAS, the Company amended and restated the AAR CORP. Supplemental Key
Employee Retirement Plan effective April 11, 2000 as the AAR CORP. Amended and
Restated Supplemental Key Employee Retirement Plan ("SKERP" or "Plan"); and

     WHEREAS, the Company now desires to further amend the Plan in certain
respects;

     NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby amends the Plan as follows:

1.   Section 1.17 is hereby amended to read as follows:

          "1.17 "Qualified Retirement Benefit" means the benefit payable to a
     Participant pursuant to the Qualified Retirement Plan, by reason of his
     termination of employment with the Company and all Affiliated Companies for
     any reason other than death."

2.   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are hereby amended to read as follows:

          "3.1 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. The Supplemental Retirement Benefit of an
     Executive Officer who is a Participant as described in Section 2.1 shall be
     a monthly amount equal to the difference between (a) and (b) below:

               (a) The monthly amount equal to, in the case of the President and
          Chief Executive Officer, one-twelfth of 60% of Final Average Earnings,
          without giving effect to the limitations imposed by Section 401(a)(17)
          of the Code or, in the case of all other Executive Officers, the
          monthly amount equal to one-twelfth of 50% of Final Average Earnings
          (or as otherwise specified in a Compensation Committee resolution
          designating an individual an Executive Officer participant), without
          giving effect to the limitations imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the
          Code, payable at the Participant's Normal Retirement Date, and if
          applicable, reduced for early commencement as provided in Section 3.7;

                                      LESS

               (b) the monthly amount of the Qualified Retirement Benefit
          payable to the Participant under the Qualified Retirement Plan at the
          Participant's Benefit Commencement Date.

<Page>

          The amount described in (a) above for any Participant who enters the
          Plan after January 1, 2001 shall be multiplied by a fraction, the
          numerator of which shall be Years of Credited Service, not to exceed
          twenty, and the denominator of which shall be twenty. Final Average
          Earnings and years of Credited Service shall be determined as of the
          Participant's date of termination of employment with the Company and
          all Affiliated Companies. The amounts described in (a) and (b) shall
          be computed in the form of an annuity payable over the Participant's
          lifetime.

               3.2 KEY EMPLOYEES. The Supplemental Retirement Benefit of a
          Participant who is a Key Employee of the Company as described in
          Section 2.2 shall be a monthly amount equal to the difference between
          (a) and (b) below:

                    (a) The monthly amount of the Qualified Retirement Benefit
               to which the Participant would have been entitled under the
               Qualified Retirement Plan without giving effect to the
               limitations imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, payable to
               the Participant under the Qualified Retirement Plan at the
               Participant's Benefit Commencement Date;

                                      LESS

                    (b) The monthly amount of the Qualified Retirement Benefit
               payable to the Participant under the Qualified Retirement Plan at
               the Participant's Benefit Commencement Date.

          The amounts described in (a) and (b) shall be computed in the form of
          an annuity payable over the Participant's lifetime. For purposes of
          calculating the Qualified Retirement Benefit under this subsection
          3.2(a) only, any Key Employee Participant who was over the age of 55
          on January 1, 2000 shall be deemed a "Grandfathered Participant" as
          defined under the Qualified Plan.

               3.3 SUPPLEMENTAL SURVIVING SPOUSE BENEFITS. If a Participant
          described in Section 2.1 or 2.2 dies prior to commencement of payment
          of his Qualified Retirement Benefit under circumstances in which a
          Qualified Surviving Spouse Benefit is payable to his Surviving Spouse,
          then a Supplemental Surviving Spouse Benefit shall be payable under
          this Plan. The Supplemental Surviving Spouse Benefit shall be paid in
          a lump sum that is the actuarial equivalent of the amount that would
          have been payable to the Participant under Section 3.1 or 3.2 at the
          date of death. Actuarial equivalence shall be determined using the
          mortality and interest rate assumptions for lump sums then in effect
          under the AAR CORP. Retirement Plan. The Supplemental Surviving Spouse
          Benefit shall be paid to the Surviving Spouse within 45 days of the
          Participant's death.

               3.4 FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT. The Supplemental
          Retirement Benefit payable to a Participant shall be paid in the same
          form under which the Qualified Retirement Benefit is payable to the
          Participant. The Participant's election under the Qualified Retirement
          Plan of any optional form of


                                       2
<Page>

          payment of his Qualified Retirement Benefit (with the valid consent of
          his Surviving Spouse where required under the Qualified Retirement
          Plan) shall also be applicable to the payment of his Supplemental
          Retirement Benefit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an
          election made by a Participant under the Qualified Retirement Plan
          with respect to the form of distribution of his benefit thereunder
          following termination of employment, or the date for commencement of
          payment thereof, shall not be effective with respect to the form of
          payment or date for commencement of payment of his Supplemental
          Retirement Benefit unless (i) such election is expressly approved in
          writing by the Company, and (ii) if such benefits are to be paid to a
          Participant in a lump sum distribution, Participant has agreed in
          writing to reimburse Company such payment amount, plus interest
          thereon at 8% per annum, immediately upon demand in the event of
          forfeiture of benefits under this Article III pursuant to Article IV
          below. If the Company shall not approve such election in writing, the
          form of payment or date for commencement of payment under this Section
          shall be selected by the Company in its sole discretion."

3.   Subsection 4.6(d) is hereby amended to read as follows:

                    "(d) TIME AND METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION. All amounts
               distributable under this Article IV to a Participant, or to his
               beneficiary in the event of his death, shall be distributed in
               the same manner and at the same time as is applicable to the
               distribution of the Participant's accounts under the Qualified
               Profit Sharing Plan following his termination of employment with
               the Company and all Affiliated Companies for any reason including
               death. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an election made
               by a Participant under the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan with
               respect to the form of distribution of his accounts thereunder
               following termination of employment, or the date for commencement
               of payment thereof, shall not be effective with respect to the
               form of payment or date for commencement of payment of his
               accounts pursuant to this Article IV, unless (i) such election is
               expressly approved in writing by the Company and (ii) if such
               benefits are to be paid to a Participant in a lump sum
               distribution, Participant has agreed, in writing, to reimburse
               Company for all such payment amounts plus interest thereon at 8%
               per annum immediately upon demand in the event of a forfeiture of
               benefits hereunder pursuant to Article V below. If the Company
               shall not approve such election in writing, the form of payment
               or date for commencement of payment under this Article shall be
               selected by the Company in its sole discretion. If a Participant
               does not elect a time or form of distribution under this Article,
               such distribution shall be made at the same time and in the same
               method as is applicable to distributions made with respect to his
               accounts under the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan. In no event may
               a Participant borrow amounts credited to the accounts maintained
               for him pursuant to this Article IV.

                    If the Company shall not approve an election made by a
               Participant pursuant to the preceding paragraph within 10 days of
               the date such


                                       3
<Page>

               election is made, the Participant shall have the right to have
               the approval of the form of payment or date for commencement of
               payment determined by an independent arbitrator mutually selected
               by the Participant and the Company. In making its decision, the
               arbitrator shall consider the financial needs and other interests
               of the Participant and the Company, including the security of
               payment that would be afforded to the Participant if payment is
               not made in a lump sum, and the decision of the arbitrator shall
               be final and conclusive for all purposes of the Plan. The Company
               shall pay the costs of such arbitration, including reasonable

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                    SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT


            This Amended and Restated Severance and Change in Control
            Agreement ("Agreement") made and entered into as of the 1st
            day of August, 2000, by and between AAR CORP., a Delaware
            corporation ("Company"), and Michael J. Sharp ("Employee").


WHEREAS, the Company currently employs Employee as an employee at will in the
capacity of Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and

WHEREAS, Employee desires the Company to pay Employee certain severance payments
upon a Change in Control of AAR CORP. and upon termination of employment prior
to a Change in Control; and

WHEREAS, the Company is willing to pay Employee severance payments under certain
circumstances if Employee agrees to confidentiality, non-compete and certain
other covenants.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein set forth and
other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.   EMPLOYMENT. Employee will continue employment with the Company as an at
     will employee subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

2.   DUTIES. During the continuation of Employee's employment, Employee shall:

     (a)  well and faithfully serve the Company and do and perform assigned
          duties and responsibilities in the ordinary course of Employee's
          employment and the business of the Company (within such limits as the
          Company may from time to time prescribe), professionally, faithfully
          and diligently.

     (b)  devote Employee's full time, energy and skill to the business of the
          Company and Employee's assigned duties and responsibilities, and to
          the promotion of the best interests of the Company; provided that
          Employee shall not (to the extent not inconsistent with Section 5
          below) be prevented from (a) serving as a director of any corporation
          consented to in advance in writing by the Company, (b) engaging in
          charitable, religious, civic or other non-profit community activities,
          or (c) investing his personal assets in such form or manner as will
          not require any substantial services on Employee's part in the
          operation or affairs of the business in which such investments are
          made or which would detract from or interfere or cause a conflict of
          interest with performance of Employee's duties hereunder.

<Page>

     (c)  observe all policies and procedures of the Company in effect from time
          to time applicable to employees of the Company including, without
          limitation, policies with respect to employee loyalty and prohibited
          conflicts of interest.

3.   BENEFITS. Employee shall be entitled to participate, according to the
     eligibility provisions of each, in such welfare plans (including but not
     limited to medical, dental, life, accident and disability insurance
     programs), vacation, retirement plans and other fringe benefits as may be
     in effect from time to time and available to other officers of the Company
     during Employee's employment term. Employee shall also be entitled to
     participate in such additional executive fringe benefits as may be
     authorized from time to time by the President and Chief Executive Officer
     of the Company. Employee shall be eligible to participate in the Company's
     Supplemental Key Employee Retirement Plan as an key employee participant.

4.   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

     (a)  Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential
          information, secret processes and know-how developed and acquired by
          AAR CORP. and its affiliates or subsidiaries (together the "Affiliated
          Companies") are among their most valuable assets and that the value of
          such information may be destroyed by unauthorized disclosure. All such
          trade secrets, confidential information, secret processes and know-how
          imparted to or learned by Employee in the course of his employment
          with respect to the business of the Affiliated Companies (whether
          acquired before or after the date hereof) will be deemed to be
          confidential and will not be used or disclosed by Employee, except to
          the extent necessary to perform Employee's duties and, in no event,
          disclosed to anyone outside the employ of the Affiliated Companies and
          their authorized consultants and advisors, unless (i) such information
          is or has been made generally available to the public, (ii) disclosure
          of such information is required by law in the opinion of Employee's
          counsel (provided that written notice thereof is given to Company as
          soon as possible but not less than 24 hours prior to such disclosure),
          or (iii) express written authorization to use or disclose such
          information has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be
          employed by the Company for any reason, Employee shall not take any
          electronically stored data, documents or other papers containing or
          reflecting trade secrets, confidential information, secret processes,
          know-how, or computer software programs from Company. Employee
          acknowledges that Employee's employment hereunder will place Employee
          in a position of utmost confidence and that Employee will have access
          to confidential information concerning the operation of the business
          of the Affiliated Companies, including, but not limited to,
          manufacturing methods, developments, secret processes, know-how,
          computer software programs, costs, prices and pricing methods, sources
          of supply and customer names and relations. All such information is in
          the nature of a trade secret


                                       2
<Page>

          and is the sole and exclusive property of the Affiliated Companies and
          shall be deemed confidential information for the purposes of this
          paragraph.

     (b)  Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that Employee may
          have as author, designer, inventor or otherwise as creator of any
          written or graphic material, design, invention, improvement, or any
          other idea or thing whatever that Employee may write, draw, design,
          conceive, perfect, or reduce to practice during employment with the
          Company or within 120 days after termination of such employment,
          whether done during or outside of normal work hours, and whether done
          alone or in conjunction with others ("Intellectual Property"),
          provided, however, that Employee reserves all rights in anything done
          or developed entirely by Employee on Employee's own personal time and
          without the use of any Company equipment, supplies, facilities or
          information, or the participation of any other Company employee,
          unless it relates to the Company's business or reasonably anticipated
          business, or grows out of any work performed by Employee for the
          Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual
          Property developed by Employee to the Company, and fully cooperate at
          the Company's request and expense in any efforts by the Company or its
          assignees to secure protection for such Intellectual Property by way
          of domestic or foreign patent, copyright, trademark or service mark
          registration or otherwise, including executing specific assignments or
          such other documents or taking such further action as may be
          considered necessary to vest title in Company or its assignees and
          obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

5.   NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

     (a)  Employee agrees that during Employee's continuation of employment with
          the Company and for one (1) year thereafter so long as the Company
          makes severance payments to Employee pursuant to subsections 5(b) or
          5(c) below, Employee shall not, without the express written consent of
          the Company, either alone or as a consultant to, or partner, employee,
          officer, director, or stockholder of any organization, entity or
          business, (i) take or convert for Employee's personal gain or benefit
          or for the benefit of any third party, any business opportunities
          which may be of interest to the Company or any Affiliated Company
          which Employee becomes aware of during the term of his employment;
          (ii) engage in direct or indirect competition with the Company or any
          Affiliated Company within 100 miles of any location within the United
          States of America or any other country where the Company or any
          Affiliated Company does business from time to time during the term
          hereof; (iii) solicit in connection with any activity which is
          competitive with any of the businesses of the Company or any


                                       3
<Page>

          Affiliated Company, any customers of the Company or any Affiliated
          Company; (iv) solicit for employment any sales, marketing or
          management employee of Company or any Affiliated Company or induce or
          attempt to induce any customer or supplier of the Company or any
          Affiliated Company to terminate or materially change such
          relationship. Company and Employee acknowledge the reasonableness of
          the foregoing covenants not to compete and non-solicitation, including
          but not limited to the geographic area and duration of time which are
          a part hereof, and further, that the restrictions stated in this
          Section 5 are reasonably necessary for the protection of Employer's
          legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant not to compete may be
          enforced with respect to any geographic area in which the Company or
          any Affiliated Company does business during the term hereof. Nothing
          herein shall prohibit Employee from being the legal or equitable
          holder, solely for investment purposes, of less than 5% of the capital
          stock of any publicly held corporation which may be in direct or
          indirect competition with the Company or any Affiliated Company.

     (b)  The Company will pay Employee, upon termination of Employee's
          employment by the Company prior to a Change in Control (as defined in
          7(c)(i) below) for any reason other than Cause (as defined in 7(c)(iv)
          below), severance each month for 12 months, in an amount (subject to
          applicable withholding) equal to 1/12 of Employee's base salary; and,
          further, if the Company pays discretionary bonuses to its officers for
          the fiscal year in which Employee's employment is terminated, Employee
          will be paid a bonus in a lump sum at the time any such bonuses are
          paid to other officers or at such time as the Severance Period is
          complete, whichever is later (with interest at prime rate plus one
          percentage point from the earlier of such dates), (1) for the
          completed fiscal year preceding termination if such bonus has not been
          paid prior to termination, and (2) for the fiscal year in which
          employment is terminated, prorata for the period prior to termination
          of employment based on Employee's performance during such period;
          provided, however, that (i) all such monthly payment obligations shall
          terminate immediately upon Employee obtaining full time employment in
          a comparable position in terms of salary level, and (ii) all such
          payment obligations shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any
          breach by Employee of Section 4 or 5(a) of this Agreement or if
          Employee shall commence any action or proceeding in any court or
          before any regulatory agency arising out of or in connection with
          termination of Employee's employment.

     (c)  If Employee terminates Employee's employment or Employee's employment
          is terminated by the Company for Cause (as defined below), the Company
          may elect (but is not required to), by written notice thereof to
          Employee, within five (5) days of any such termination of Employee's
          employment with the Company prior to a Change in Control (as defined
          below), to pay Employee severance as provided in and subject to the
          provisions of subsection 5(b) above.

     (d)  Employee may terminate this Severance and Change in Control Agreement
          effective immediately upon notice thereof in writing to Company at any
          time while still employed within a sixty (60) calendar day period
          immediately following the effective date of any reduction by Company
          in (i) Employee's level of responsibility


                                       4
<Page>

          or position from that held by Employee as Vice President, Controller
          and Chief Accounting Officer on the effective date of this Agreement,
          or (ii) Employee's level of compensation, including retirement
          benefits in effect immediately prior to any such change.

     (e)  If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 5 shall be
          deemed invalid or unenforceable by the laws of the jurisdiction in
          which it is to be enforced by reason of being vague or unreasonable as
          to duration, geographic scope, nature of activities restricted, or for
          any other reason, this provision shall be considered divisible as to
          such portions and the foregoing restrictions set forth in 5(a) shall
          become and be immediately amended to include only such duration, scope
          or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable and
          enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction to enforce
          this Agreement; and the parties hereto agree that the restrictions, as
          so amended, shall be valid and binding as though the invalid or
          unenforceable portion had not been involved herein.

     (f)  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company would be
          irreparably harmed by violations of Section 4 or Section 5(a) above,
          and in recognition thereof, the Company shall be entitled to an
          injunction or other decree of specific performance with respect to any
          violation thereof (without any bond or other security being required)
          in addition to other available legal and equitable remedies.

6.       TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

     (a)  Upon and after termination of employment howsoever arising, Employee
          shall, upon request by Company:

          (1)  immediately return to the Company all correspondence, documents,
               business calendars/diaries, or other property belonging to the
               Company which is in Employee's possession,

          (2)  immediately resign from any office Employee holds with the
               Company or any Affiliated Company; and

          (3)  cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in the
               resolution of all matters Employee worked on or was involved in
               during Employee's employment with the Company. Employee's
               cooperation will include reasonable consultation by telephone.
               Further, in connection therewith, Employee will, at Company's
               request upon reasonable advance notice and subject to Employee's
               availability, make Employee available to Company in person at
               Company's premises, for testimony in court, or elsewhere;
               provided, however, that in such event, Company shall reimburse
               all


                                       5
<Page>

               Employee's reasonable expenses and pay Employee a reasonable per
               diem or hourly stipend.

7.   CHANGE IN CONTROL.

     (a)  In the event (i) a Change in Control of AAR CORP. occurs and (ii) (A)
          at any time during the 18 month period commencing on the date of the
          Change in Control the Company terminates Employee's employment for
          other than Cause or Disability, or Employee terminates Employee's
          employment for Good Reason, in either case by written notice to the
          other party (including the particulars thereof), and having given the
          other party the opportunity to be heard with respect thereto, or (B)
          Employee's employment with the Company terminates for any reason other
          than Disability or death during the 30 day period commencing on the
          expiration of the aforementioned 18 month period, then:

          (1)  The Company shall promptly pay to Employee, in a lump sum, a cash
               payment in an amount equal to the sum of (A) all base salary
               earned through the date of termination, (B) any annual cash bonus
               earned by Employee for the fiscal year of the Company most
               recently ended prior to the date of termination to the extend
               unpaid on the date of termination, (C) a prorata portion of the
               annual cash bonus, including the value of any restricted stock
               grant in lieu of annual cash bonus, Employee would have earned
               had Employee been employed by the Company on the last day of the
               fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs (as if all
               performance targets have been met or, in the event the bonus is
               of the "discretionary" type, the bonus shall be based on a
               percentage of base salary which is not less than percentage of
               base salary received as bonus for the preceding fiscal year) that
               is applicable to the period commencing on the first day of such
               fiscal year and ending on the date of termination, and (D) any
               and all other benefits and amounts earned by Employee prior to
               the date of termination to the extent unpaid, all subject to
               applicable withholding.

          (2)  The Company shall promptly pay to Employee in a lump sum, a cash
               payment in an amount equal to three times Employee's total
               compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus) for either the
               fiscal year of the Company most recently ended prior to the date
               of termination, or the preceding fiscal year, whichever is the
               highest total compensation, subject to applicable withholding.
               Employee may elect to take payment of any amounts on a schedule
               of Employee's own choosing; provided that such schedule shall be
               completed no later than three years from the date of Employee's
               termination of employment.

          (3)  Employee and Employee's dependents shall continue to be covered
               by, and receive employee welfare and executive fringe benefits
               (including but not limited to medical, dental, life, accident and
               disability insurance available to officers of the Company and
               additional executive retirement and other fringe benefits
               approved by the President and CEO of the Company) in accordance
               with the terms of the Company's benefit plans and executive
               fringe benefit programs, for three years following the date of
               termination, and at no less than the levels Employee and
               Employee's dependents were receiving immediately prior to the
               Change in Control. Employee's dependents shall be entitled to
               continued benefits coverage pursuant to the preceding sentence
               for the balance of such three year period in the event of
               Employee's death during such period. The period during which
               Employee and Employee's dependents are entitled to continuation
               of group health plan coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the
               Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Part 6 of Title I
               of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
               amended, shall commence on the date next following the expiration
               of the aforementioned three year period.

          (4)  Employee shall receive an additional retirement benefit, over and
               above that which Employee would normally be entitled to under the
               Company's retirement plans or programs applicable to Employee,
               equal to the


                                       7
<Page>

               actuarial equivalent of the additional amount that Employee would
               have earned under such retirement plans or programs had Employee
               accumulated three additional continuous years of service. Such
               amount shall be paid to Employee in a cash lump sum payment on
               the earlier to occur of Employee's termination of employment
               following a Change in Control or Employee's Retirement Date,
               together with a gross-up bonus in an amount equal to any federal,
               state and local income taxes and excise taxes (including FICA and
               any similar taxes) payable by Employee on such lump sum payment
               and such gross-up bonus.

          (5)  The Company, at its expense, shall provide Employee with
               outplacement services of a nationally recognized outplacement
               firm of the Employee's choosing until the earlier of (a) the
               Employee's attainment of employment, or (b) the date eighteen
               (18) months from the date of Employee's termination of
               employment; provided, however, that the cost of such outplacement

          and notwithstanding any conditions or restrictions related to any
          Award granted to Employee under the Plan, all Options or Limited
          Rights, or both, granted to Employee under the Plan will become
          immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for the full remaining
          life of the option whether or not Employee's employment continues, and
          all restrictions on Restricted Stock granted to Employee under the

                                       9
<Page>

                    180 consecutive days and which is expected to continue to
                    render Employee unable to substantially perform Employee's
                    duties on a full-time basis and otherwise meets the benefit
                    eligibility requirements of the Company's Long Term
                    Disability Welfare Benefit Plan or any executive program in
                    which Employee was a participant at the time of a Change in
                    Control. The Company will make reasonable accommodation for
                    any handicap of Employee as may be required by applicable
                    law.

               In the event of termination by the Company for Disability after a
               Change in Control, a good faith determination of the existence of

               Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole
               discretion, setting forth the particulars of the Disability which
               shall be final and binding upon the Employee. The Company may
               require the submission of such medical evidence as to the
               condition of the Employee as it may deem necessary in order to
               arrive at its determination of the occurrence of a Disability,
               and Employee will cooperate in providing any such information.
               Employee will be provided with reasonable opportunity to present
               additional medical evidence as to the medical condition of
               Employee for consideration prior to the Board making its
               determination of the occurrence of a Disability.

               Upon termination of Employment by Company for Disability after a
               Change in Control, Employee will receive Disability payments
               pursuant to the Company's short and long term Disability welfare
               benefit plans then in effect according to the terms of such plans
               and continue to be eligible to participate in the Company's
               medical, dental and life insurance programs then in effect and
               available to officers of the Company in accordance with their
               terms for a period of 3 years from the date of such termination
               of this Agreement.

          (iv) "Cause" means:

               (1)  Employee engages, during the performance of Employee's
                    duties hereunder, in acts or omissions constituting
                    dishonesty, intentional breach of fiduciary obligation or
                    intentional wrongdoing or malfeasance;

               (2)  Employee intentionally disobeys or disregards a lawful and
                    proper direction of the Board or the Company; or

               (3)  Employee materially breaches the Agreement and such breach
                    by its nature, is incapable of being cured, or such breach
                    remains uncured


                                       10

                    for more than 10 days following receipt by Employee of
                    written notice from the Company specifying the nature of the
                    breach and demanding the cure thereof. For purposes of this
                    clause (3), a material breach of the Agreement that involves
                    inattention by Employee to Employee's duties under the

               Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following
               shall not constitute Cause for the termination of employment of
               Employee or the modification or diminution of any of Employee's
               authority hereunder:

               (1)  any personal or policy disagreement between Employee and the
                    Company or any member of the Board; or

               (2)  any action taken by Employee in connection with Employee's
                    duties hereunder, or any failure to act, if Employee acted
                    or failed to act in good faith and in a manner Employee
                    reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best
                    interest of the Company and Employee had no reasonable cause
                    to believe Employee's conduct was unlawful; or

               (3)  termination of Employee's employment for overall
                    unsatisfactory performance (including, but not limited to,
                    failure to meet financial goals).

               Termination for Cause shall be limited to a good faith finding by
               resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board,. setting
               forth the particulars thereof. Any such action shall be taken at
               a regular or specially called meeting of the Compensation
               Committee of the Board, after a minimum 10 days notice thereof to
               Employee, with termination of Employee's employment with the
               Company for Cause listed as an agenda item. Employee will be
               given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at such meeting with
               counsel present if Employee desires. Any such resolution shall be
               final and binding.

               Upon termination of employment by Company for Cause, no further
               compensation or benefits shall accrue or be payable to Employee
               by the Company, except for any compensation, bonus or other
               benefits which have accrued to Employee prior to the date of any
               such termination.

               Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Company from
               terminating Employee's employment at any time for any reason or
               for no reason.


                                       11

          (d)  The Company will pay reasonable legal/attorney's fees (including
               court costs and other costs of litigation) incurred by Employee
               in connection with enforcement of any right or benefit under this
               Agreement.

          (e)  The Company shall promptly pay Employee a gross-up bonus in an
               amount equal to (i) all excise taxes payable under Section 280G
               of the Internal Revenue Code on any amounts constituting "golden
               parachute" payments, plus (ii) any federal, state, and local
               income taxes and excise taxes (including FICA) payable by
               Employee on such gross-up bonus in order to put Employee in the
               same position Employee would have been in if the excise tax
               provision (Section 280G) did not apply.

          (f)  The Company will continue to provide SKERP retirement benefits to
               Employee and Employee's spouse at no less than the level they are
               receiving or entitled to receive under the SKERP as it was in
               effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.

8.   CHANGES IN BUSINESS. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors,
     will at all times have complete control over the Company's business and
     retirement and other employee health and welfare benefit plans ("Plans").
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any
     time or times change or discontinue any or all of its present or future
     operations or Plans (subject to their terms), may close or move any one or

     judgment, shall deem desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or
     recourse against the Company, its officers, directors or employees by
     reason of such action except for enforcement of the provisions of Sections
     5 and 7 of this Agreement.

9.   SEVERANCE PAYMENT AS SOLE OBLIGATION. Except as expressly provided in
     Sections 5 and 7 above, no further compensation, payments, liabilities or
     benefits shall accrue or be payable to Employee upon or as a result of
     termination of Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever except for
     any compensation, bonus or other benefits which accrued to Employee prior
     to the date of employment termination.

     The amounts paid to the Employee under Section 5 and 7 of this Agreement
     shall be considered severance pay in consideration of past services
     Employee has rendered to the Company and in consideration of Employee's
     continued service from the date hereof to entitlement to those payments.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein set forth and

          forth herein. The Company may change Employee's title, duties and
          location of employment from time to time as the Company determines, in
          its sole discretion, to be in the bests interest of the Company.

     b.   Compensation and benefits shall be as set forth in Attachment A
          hereto.

2.   DUTIES. During his employment, Employee shall:

     (a)  well and faithfully serve the Company and do and perform assigned
          duties and responsibilities in the ordinary course of his employment
          and the business of the Company (within such limits as the Company may
          from time to time prescribe), professionally, faithfully and
          diligently.

     (b)  devote his full time, energy and skill to the business of the Company
          and his assigned duties and responsibilities, and to the promotion of
          the best interests of the Company; provided that Employee shall not
          (to the extent not inconsistent with Section 4 below) be prevented
          from (a) serving as a director of any corporation consented to in
          advance in writing by the Company, (b) engaging in charitable,
          religious, civic or other non-profit community activities, or (c)
          investing his personal assets in such form or manner as will not

          affairs of the business in which such investments are

<Page>

          made or which would detract from or interfere or cause a conflict of
          interest with performance of his duties hereunder.

     (c)  observe all policies and procedures of the Company in effect from time
          to time applicable to employees of the Company including, without
          limitation, policies with respect to employee loyalty and prohibited
          conflicts of interest.

3.   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

     (a)  Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential
          information, secret processes and know-how developed and acquired by
          AAR CORP. and its affiliates or subsidiaries (together the "Affiliated
          Companies") are among their most valuable assets and that the value of
          such information may be destroyed by unauthorized disclosure. All such
          trade secrets, confidential information, secret processes and know-how
          imparted to or learned by Employee in the course of his employment
          with respect to the business of the Affiliated Companies (whether
          acquired before or after the date hereof) will be deemed to be
          confidential and will not be used or disclosed by Employee, except to
          the extent necessary to perform Employee's duties and, in no event,
          disclosed to anyone outside the employ of the Affiliated Companies and
          their authorized consultants and advisors, unless (i) such information
          is or has been made generally available to the public, (ii) disclosure
          of such information is required by law in the opinion of Employee's
          counsel (provided that written notice thereof is given to Company as
          soon as possible but not less than 24 hours prior to such disclosure),
          or (iii) express written authorization to use or disclose such
          information has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be
          employed by the Company for any reason, Employee shall not take any
          electronically stored data, documents or other papers containing or
          reflecting trade secrets, confidential information, secret processes,
          know-how, or computer software programs from the Company. Employee
          acknowledges that Employee's employment hereunder will place Employee
          in a position of utmost confidence and that Employee will have access
          to confidential information concerning the operation of the business
          of the Affiliated Companies, including, but not limited to,
          manufacturing methods, developments, secret processes, know-how,
          computer software programs, costs, prices and pricing methods, sources
          of supply and customer names and relations. All such information is in
          the nature of a trade secret and is the sole and exclusive property of
          the Affiliated Companies and shall be deemed confidential information
          for the purposes of this paragraph.

     (b)  Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that Employee may
          have as author, designer, inventor or otherwise as creator of any
          written or graphic material, design, invention, improvement, or any
          other idea or thing whatever that Employee may write, draw, design,
          conceive, perfect, or reduce to practice during employment with the
          Company or within 120 days after termination of such employment,
          whether done during or outside of normal work hours, and whether done
          alone or in conjunction with others ("Intellectual Property"),
          provided, however, that Employee reserves all rights in anything done
          or developed entirely by Employee on Employee's own personal time and
          without the use of any Company equipment,


                                       2
<Page>

          supplies, facilities or information, or the participation of any other
          Company employee, unless it relates to the Company's business or
          reasonably anticipated business, or grows out of any work performed by
          Employee for the Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such
          Intellectual Property developed by Employee to the Company, and fully
          cooperate at the Company's request and expense in any efforts by the
          Company or its assignees to secure protection for such Intellectual
          Property by way of domestic or foreign patent, copyright, trademark or
          service mark registration or otherwise, including executing specific
          assignments or such other documents or taking such further action as
          may be considered necessary to vest title in Company or its assignees
          and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

4.   NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

     (a)  Employee agrees that through May 31, 2005, or thereafter during
          Employee's continuation of employment with the Company and for one
          year thereafter, provided that the Company makes severance payments to
          Employee pursuant to subsections 4(b) and 4(c) below, Employee shall
          not, without the express written consent of the Company, either alone
          or as a consultant to, or partner, employee, officer, director, or
          stockholder of any organization, entity or business, (i) take or
          convert for Employee's personal gain or benefit or for the benefit of
          any third party, any business opportunities which may be of interest
          to the Company or any Affiliated Company which Employee becomes aware
          of during the term of his employment; (ii) engage in direct or
          indirect competition with the Company or any Affiliated Company within
          100 miles of any location within the United States of America or any
          other country where the Company or any Affiliated Company does
          business from time to time during the term hereof; (iii) solicit in
          connection with any activity which is competitive with any of the
          businesses of the Company or any Affiliated Company, any customers of
          the Company or any Affiliated Company; (iv) solicit for employment any
          sales, marketing or management employee of Company or any Affiliated
          Company or induce or attempt to induce any customer or supplier of the
          Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate or materially change
          such relationship. Company and Employee acknowledge the reasonableness
          of the foregoing covenants not to compete and non-solicitation,
          including but not limited to the geographic area and duration of time
          which are a part hereof, and further, that the restrictions stated in
          this Section 4 are reasonably necessary for the protection of
          Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant not to
          compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area in which
          the Company or any Affiliated Company does business during the term
          hereof. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee from being the legal or
          equitable holder, solely for investment purposes, of less than 5% of
          the capital stock of any publicly held corporation which may be in
          direct or indirect competition with the Company or any Affiliated
          Company.

     (b)  The Company will pay Employee, upon termination of Employee's
          employment by the Company prior to a Change in Control (as defined in
          6(c)(i) below) for any reason other than Cause (as defined in 6(c)(iv)
          below), severance each month for


                                       3
<Page>

          twelve months in an amount (subject to applicable withholding) equal
          to 1/12 of Employee's annual base salary; and, further, if the Company
          pays discretionary bonuses to its officers for the fiscal year in
          which Employee's employment is terminated, Employee will be paid a
          bonus in a lump sum at the time any such bonuses are paid to other
          officers or at such time as the Severance Period is complete,
          whichever is later (with interest at prime rate plus one percentage
          point from the earlier of such dates), (1) for the completed fiscal
          year preceding termination if such bonus has not been paid prior to
          termination, and (2) for the fiscal year in which employment is
          terminated, prorata for the period prior to termination of employment
          based on Employee's performance during such period; provided, however
          that (i) all such monthly payment obligations shall terminate
          immediately upon Employee obtaining full time employment in a
          comparable position in terms of salary level, and (ii) all such
          payment obligations shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any
          breach by Employee of Section 4 or 5(a) of this Agreement or if
          Employee shall commence any action or proceeding in any court or
          before any regulatory agency arising out of or in connection with
          termination of Employee's employment.

     (c)  If Employee terminates Employee's employment prior to May 31, 2005,
          Employee shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 4(a) until
          May 31, 2005. If Employee's employment is terminated by the Company
          for Cause (as defined below) or Employee terminates his employment
          after May 31, 2005, and prior to a Change in Control, the Company may
          elect (but is not required to), by written notice thereof to Employee,
          within five (5) days of any such termination of Employee's employment
          with the Company prior to a Change in Control (as defined below), to
          pay Employee severance as provided in and subject to the provisions of
          subsection 4(b) above.

     (d)  If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 4 shall be
          deemed invalid or unenforceable by the laws of the jurisdiction in
          which it is to be enforced by reason of being vague or unreasonable as
          to duration, geographic scope, nature of activities restricted, or for
          any other reason, this provision shall be considered divisible as to
          such portions and the foregoing restrictions set forth in 4(a) shall
          become and be immediately amended to include only such duration, scope
          or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable and
          enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction to enforce
          this Agreement; and the parties hereto agree that the restrictions, as
          so amended, shall be valid and binding as though the invalid or
          unenforceable portion had not been involved herein.

     (e)  The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company would be
          irreparably harmed by violations of Section 3 or Section 4(a) above,
          and in recognition thereof, the Company shall be entitled to an
          injunction or other decree of specific performance with respect to any
          violation thereof (without any bond or other security being required)
          in addition to other available legal and equitable remedies.

     (f)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Section 3 and 4 of
          this Agreement shall survive any termination of Employee's employment
          with the Company.


                                       4

5.   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

     (a)  Upon and after termination of employment howsoever arising, Employee
          shall, upon request by Company:

          (1)  immediately return to the Company all correspondence, documents,
               business calendars/diaries, or other property belonging to the
               Company which is in Employee's possession,

          (2)  immediately resign from any office Employee holds with the
               Company or any Affiliated Company; and

          (3)  cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in the
               resolution of all matters Employee worked on or was involved in
               during Employee's employment with the Company. Employee's
               cooperation will include reasonable consultation by telephone.
               Further, in connection therewith, Employee will, at Company's
               request upon reasonable advance notice and subject to Employee's
               availability, make Employee available to Company in person at
               Company's premises, for testimony in court, or elsewhere;
               provided, however, that in such event, Company shall reimburse
               all Employee's reasonable expenses and pay Employee a reasonable
               per diem or hourly stipend.

6.   CHANGE IN CONTROL.

     (a)  In the event (i) a Change in Control of AAR CORP. occurs, and (ii) (A)
          at any time during the 18 month period commencing on the date of the
          Change in Control the Company terminates Employee's employment for
          other than Cause or Disability, or Employee terminates Employee's
          employment for Good Reason, in either case by written notice to the
          other party (including the particulars thereof), and having given the
          other party opportunity to be heard with respect thereto, or (B)
          Employee's employment with the Company terminates for any reason other
          than Disability or death during the 30 day period commencing on the
          expiration of the aforementioned 18 month period, then:

          (1)  The Company shall promptly pay to Employee, in a lump sum, a cash
               payment in an amount equal to the sum of (A) all base salary
               earned through the date of termination, (B) any annual cash bonus
               earned by Employee for the fiscal year of the Company most
               recently ended prior to the date of termination to the extent
               unpaid on the date of termination, (C) a prorata portion of the
               annual cash bonus, including the value of any restricted stock
               grant in lieu of annual cash bonus, Employee would have earned
               had Employee been employed by the Company on the last day of the
               fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs (as if all
               performance targets have been met or, in the event the bonus is
               of the "discretionary" type, the bonus shall be based on a
               percentage of base salary which is not less than


                                       5
<Page>

               percentage of base salary received as bonus for the preceding
               fiscal year) that is applicable to the period commencing on the
               first day of such fiscal year and ending on the date of
               termination, and (D) any and all other benefits and amounts
               earned by Employee prior to the date of termination to the extent
               unpaid, all subject to applicable withholding.

          (2)  The Company shall promptly pay to Employee in a lump sum, a
               cash payment in an amount equal to three times Employee's
               total compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus) for
               either the fiscal year of the Company most recently ended
               prior to the date of termination, or the preceding fiscal
               year, whichever is the highest total compensation, subject to
               applicable withholding. Employee may elect to take payment of
               any amounts on a schedule of Employee's own choosing; provided
               that such schedule shall be completed no later than three
               years from the date of Employee's termination of employment.

          (3)  Employee and his dependents shall continue to be covered by,
               and receive employee welfare and executive fringe benefits
               (including but not limited to medical, dental, life, accident
               and disability insurance available to officers of the Company
               and additional executive retirement and other fringe benefits
               approved by the President and CEO of the Company) in
               accordance with the terms of the Company's benefit plans and
               executive fringe benefit programs, for three years following
               the date of termination, and at no less than the levels
               Employee and Employee's dependents were receiving immediately
               prior to the Change in Control. Employee's dependents shall be
               entitled to continued benefits coverage pursuant to the
               preceding sentence for the balance of such three year period
               in the event of Employee's death during such period. The
               period during which Employee and Employee's dependents are
               entitled to continuation of group health plan coverage
               pursuant to Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of
               1986, as amended, and Part 6 of Title I of the Employee
               Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, shall
               commence on the date next following the expiration of the
               aforementioned three year period.

          (4)  Employee shall receive an additional retirement benefit, over
               and above that which Employee would normally be entitled to
               under the Company's retirement plans or programs applicable to
               Employee, equal to the additional amount that Employee would
               have earned under such retirement plans or programs had
               Employee accumulated three additional continuous years of
               service. Such amount shall be paid to Employee in a cash lump
               sum payment on the earlier to occur of Employee's termination
               of employment following a Change in Control or Employee's
               Retirement Date, together with a gross-up bonus in an amount
               equal to any federal, state and local income taxes and excise
               taxes (including FICA and any similar taxes) payable by
               Employee on such lump sum payment and such gross-up bonus.

                                       6

          (5)  The Company, at its expense, shall provide Employee with
               outplacement services of a nationally recognized outplacement
               firm of the Employee's choosing until the earlier of (a) the
               Employee's attainment of employment, or (b) the date eighteen
               (18) months from the date of Employee's termination of
               employment; provided, however, that the cost of such
               outplacement services shall not exceed 3.5% of the cash
               payment due to Employee pursuant to subsection 6(a)(2) above.

          (6)  The amounts paid to Employee under this Change in Control
               provision applicable to Employee shall be considered severance
               pay in consideration of past service Employee has rendered to
               the Company and in consideration of Employee's continued
               service from the date hereof to entitlement of those payments.

     (b)  In the event that a Change in Control occurs, whether or not such
          Change in Control has the prior written approval of a majority of
          the Continuing Directors (as defined in the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit
          Plan), and notwithstanding any conditions or restrictions related
          to any Award granted to Employee under the Plan, all Options or
          Limited Rights, or both, granted to Employee under the Plan will
          become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for the full
          remaining life of the option whether or not Employee's employment
          continues, and all restrictions on Restricted Stock granted to
          Employee under the Plan will immediately lapse.

     (c)  For purposes of this Agreement

          (i)  "Change in Control" means the earliest of:

               (1)  any person (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the
                    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange
                    Act")), has acquired (other than directly from the
                    Company) beneficial ownership (as that term is defined in
                    Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), of more than 20% of
                    the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to
                    vote for the election of directors; or

               (2)  the effective time of (i) a merger or consolidation or
                    other business combination of the Company with one or
                    more other corporations as a result of which the holders
                    of the outstanding voting stock of the Company
                    immediately prior to such business combination hold less
                    than 60% of the voting stock of the surviving or
                    resulting corporation, or (ii) a transfer of
                    substantially all of the assets of the Company other than
                    to an entity of which the Company owns at least 80% of
                    the voting stock; or

               (3)  the election over any period of time to the Board of
                    Directors of the Company without the recommendation or
                    approval of the incumbent Board of Directors of the
                    Company, of the lesser of (i) three

                    directors, or (ii) directors constituting a majority of the
                    number of directors of the Company then in office.

          (ii) "Good Reason" means:

               (1)  a material reduction in the nature or scope of Employee's
                    duties, responsibilities, authority, power or functions
                    from those enjoyed by Employee immediately prior to the
                    Change in Control, or a material reduction in Employee's
                    compensation (including benefits), occurring at any time
                    during the two-year period immediately after the Change
                    in Control; or

               (2)  if the incumbent in the position of President and CEO of
                    the Company on the effective date hereof is not the
                    President and CEO of the Company at the time of
                    termination, a good faith determination by Employee that
                    as the result of a Change in Control and a material
                    change in employment circumstances at any time during the
                    two year period immediately after the Change in Control,
                    Employee is unable to carry out Employee's assigned
                    duties and responsibilities in a manner consistent with
                    the practices, standards, values or philosophy of the

               (3)  a relocation of the primary place of employment of at
                    least 100 miles.

          (iii) "Disability" means:

               (1)  a physical or mental condition which has prevented
                    Employee from substantially performing Employee's
                    assigned duties for a period of 180 consecutive days and
                    which is expected to continue to render Employee unable
                    to substantially perform Employee's duties on a full-time
                    basis and otherwise meets the benefit eligibility
                    requirements of the Company's Long Term Disability
                    Welfare Benefit Plan or any executive program in which
                    Employee was a participant at the time of a Change in
                    Control. The Company will make reasonable accommodation
                    for any handicap of Employee as may be required by
                    applicable law.

               In the event of termination by the Company for Disability
               after a Change in Control, a good faith determination of the
               existence of a Disability shall be made by resolution of the
               Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
               Company, in its sole discretion, setting forth the particulars
               of the Disability which shall be final and binding upon the
               Employee. The Company may require the submission of such
               medical evidence as to the condition of the Employee as it may
               deem necessary in order to arrive at its determination of the
               occurrence of a Disability, and Employee will

                                       8
<Page>

               cooperate in providing any such information. Employee will be
               provided with reasonable opportunity to present additional
               medical evidence as to the medical condition of Employee for
               consideration prior to the Board making its determination of
               the occurrence of a Disability.

               Upon termination of Employment by Company for Disability after
               a Change in Control, Employee will receive Disability payments
               pursuant to the Company's short and long term Disability
               welfare benefit plans then in effect according to the terms of
               such plans and continue to be eligible to participate in the
               Company's medical, dental and life insurance programs then in
               effect and available to officers of the Company in accordance
               with their terms for a period of 3 years from the date of such
               termination of this Agreement.

          (iv) "Cause" means:

               (1)  Employee engages, during the performance of his duties
                    hereunder, in acts or omissions constituting dishonesty,
                    intentional breach of fiduciary obligation or intentional
                    wrongdoing or malfeasance;

               (2)  Employee intentionally disobeys or disregards a lawful and
                    proper direction of the Board or the Company; or

               (3)  Employee materially breaches the Agreement and such breach
                    by its nature, is incapable of being cured, or such breach
                    remains uncured for more than 10 days following receipt by
                    Employee of written notice from the Company specifying the
                    nature of the breach and demanding the cure thereof. For
                    purposes of this clause (3), a material breach of the
                    Agreement that involves inattention by Employee to
                    Employee's duties under the Agreement shall be deemed a
                    breach capable of cure.

               Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following
               shall not constitute Cause for the termination of the employment
               of Employee or the modification or diminution of any of his
               authority hereunder:

               (1)  any personal or policy disagreement between Employee and the
                    Company or any member of the Board, or

               (2)  any action taken by Employee in connection with his duties
                    hereunder, or any failure to act, if Employee acted or
                    failed to act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
                    believed to be in and not opposed to the best interest of
                    the Company and Employee had no reasonable cause to believe
                    Employee's conduct was unlawful, or

               (3)  termination of Employee's employment for overall
                    unsatisfactory performance (including, but not limited to,
                    failure to meet financial goals).

                    Termination for Cause shall be limited to a good faith
                    finding by resolution of the Compensation Committee of the
                    Board, setting forth the particulars thereof. Any such
                    action shall be taken at a regular or specially called
                    meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Board, after a
                    minimum 10 days notice thereof to Employee, with termination
                    of Employee's employment with the Company for Cause listed
                    as an agenda item. Employee will be given a reasonable
                    opportunity to be heard at such meeting with counsel present
                    if Employee desires. Any such resolution shall be final and
                    binding.

                    Upon termination of employment by Company for Cause, no
                    further compensation or benefits shall accrue or be payable
                    to Employee by the Company, except for any compensation,
                    bonus or other benefits which have accrued to Employee prior
                    to the date of any such termination.

                    Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Company
                    from terminating Employee's employment at any time for any
                    reason or for no reason.

     (d)  The Company will pay reasonable legal/attorney's fees (including
          court costs and other costs of litigation) incurred by Employee in
          connection with enforcement of any right or benefit under this
          Agreement.

     (e)  The Company shall promptly pay Employee a gross-up bonus in an
          amount equal to (i) all excise taxes payable under Section 280G of
          the Internal Revenue Code on any amounts constituting "golden
          parachute" payments, plus (ii) any federal, state, and local income
          taxes and excise taxes (including FICA) payable by Employee on such
          gross-up bonus in order to put Employee in the same position he
          would have been in if the excise tax provision (Section 280G) did
          not apply.

     (f)  The Company will continue to provide SKERP retirement benefits to
          Employee and Employee's spouse at no less than the level they are
          receiving or entitled to receive under the SKERP as it was in
          effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.

7.   CHANGES IN BUSINESS. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors,
     will at all times have complete control over the Company's business and
     retirement and other employee health and welfare benefit plans ("Plans").
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any
     time or times change or discontinue any or all of its present or future
     operations or Plans (subject to their terms), may close or move any one or
     more of its divisions or offices, may undertake any new servicing or sales
     operation, may sell any one or more of its divisions or offices to any
     company not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or may take
     any and all other steps which its Board of Directors, in its exclusive
     judgment, shall deem desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or
     recourse against the Company, its officers, directors or employees by
     reason of such action except for enforcement of the provisions of Sections
     4 and 6 of this Agreement.

8.   SEVERANCE PAYMENT AS SOLE OBLIGATION. Except as expressly provided in
     Sections 4 and 6 above, no further compensation, payments, liabilities or
     benefits shall accrue or be payable to Employee upon or as a result of
     termination of Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever except for
     any compensation, bonus or other benefits which accrued to Employee prior
     to the date of employment termination.

     The amounts paid to the Employee under Section 4 and 6 of this Agreement
     shall be considered severance pay in consideration of Employee's past
     services Employee has rendered to the Company and in consideration of
     Employee's continued service from the date hereof to entitlement to those
     payments.

9.   NOTICES. Any notice or other instrument or thing required or permitted to
     be given, served or delivered to any of the parties hereto shall be

          without further effect; provided, however, that, upon the sale or
          transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or
          upon the merger by the Company into or the combination with another
          corporation or other business entity, or upon the liquidation or
          dissolution of the Company, this Agreement will inure to the benefit
          of and be binding upon the person, firm or corporation purchasing such
          assets, or the corporation surviving such merger or consolidation, or
          the shareholder effecting such liquidation or dissolution, as the case
          may be. After any such transaction, the term Company in this Agreement
          shall refer to the entity which conducts the business now conducted by

          attempted assignment, transfer, pledge or hypothecation or any other
          disposition of this Agreement or of such rights, interests and
          benefits contrary to the foregoing provisions or the levy or any
          execution, attachment or similar process thereon shall be null and
          void and without further effect.

     provision herein contained.

     Company, Employee, and their respective legal counsel. Accordingly, the

     of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
