<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition
in the worldwide aviation/aerospace industry is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery and price. Competitors in both
the Inventory and Logistic Services and the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segments include original equipment manufacturers (including the service divisions of the original equipment
manufacturers), commercial airlines (including the maintenance divisions of large commercial airlines), and other independent suppliers of parts and services. In certain activities of the Company's
Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segment, the Company faces competition from financial institutions, syndicators, commercial and specialized leasing companies and other entities that provide
financing. AAR's pallet, container and shelter manufacturing activities in its Manufacturing segment compete with several modest-sized private companies, and its cargo systems competitors include a
number of divisions of large corporations. Although certain of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company, AAR believes that it has maintained
a satisfactory competitive position through its responsiveness to customer needs, its attention to quality and its unique combination of market expertise, technical capabilities and financial
strength. </FONT></P>

May&nbsp;31, 2002, backlog believed to be firm was approximately $93,400 compared to $74,100 at May&nbsp;31, 2001. An additional $16,300 of unfunded government options on awarded
contracts also existed at May&nbsp;31, 2002. Approximately $91,600 of this backlog is expected to be filled within the next 12&nbsp;months. The increase in the Company's backlog is due primarily
to increased orders in the Manufacturing and Inventory and Logistic Services segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
of the Company's aviation-related activities and products are subject to licensing, certification and other requirements imposed by the FAA and other regulatory agencies, both
domestic and foreign. The Company believes that it possesses all licenses and certifications that are material to the conduct of its business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
May&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 2,200 persons worldwide. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
to the U.S. Government, its agencies and its contractors were approximately $163,173 (25.5% of total sales), $139,072 (15.9% of total sales) and $132,048 (12.9% of total sales) in
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Because such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at levels
previously experienced. The majority of the Company's government contracts are for aviation products and services used for ongoing routine military logistic support activities; unlike weapons systems
and other high-technology military requirements, these products and services are less likely to be affected by significant changes in defense spending. The Company's contracts with the
U.S. Government and its agencies are typically firm agreements to provide aviation products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one
or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government agency. Although the Company's government contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government, in the event of
such a termination the Company would be entitled to recover from the government all allowable costs incurred by the Company through the date of termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
subsidiary of the Company ("subsidiary") received a letter dated June&nbsp;14, 2002, from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") relating to environmental
conditions at and in the vicinity of the subsidiary's Cadillac, Michigan plant. The MDEQ alleges that the subsidiary's on-site groundwater purge and treatment system has not operated as
required by a 1985 Consent Order between the subsidiary and the State of Michigan, thereby allowing contamination to spread and threaten residential drinking water wells to the west of the plant site.
The MDEQ also alleges that a solvent was released at the plant site and caused contamination to reach the groundwater where it commingled with pre-existing contamination. The letter
demands that the subsidiary perform additional environmental investigatory work, evaluate the effectiveness of the existing groundwater purge and treatment system, upgrade the equipment as needed and
prepare and submit to the MDEQ a remedial action plan for the entire contaminated area related to the subsidiary's Cadillac plant. The letter further demands payment of environmental investigative
costs already incurred by the MDEQ in the amount of $525 plus interest plus unspecified costs to be incurred in the future by the MDEQ. The letter indicates that the State is prepared to seek civil
penalties if the subsidiary does not promptly negotiate an administrative consent order with the State and that the State may file&nbsp;a civil judicial action and place a lien on the subsidiary's
plant site for the costs incurred and to be incurred by the State. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
subsidiary plans to vigorously assert various defenses to the allegations and claims made by the State, including the defense that a 1985 Consent Order entered into with the State
previously resolved most of the claims now asserted by the State. The subsidiary plans to bring technical information to the attention of the State to show that any post-Consent Decree
release of hazardous substances, as alleged by the State, was </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>de minimis</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The subsidiary is in the process of developing its response to the State and
will participate in settlement discussions which have been suggested by the State. It is not possible at this stage to determine the expenditures that may be required in connection with this matter.
The subsidiary has received some funds from an insurance carrier to reimburse it for work done by the
subsidiary under the 1985 Consent Decree and will seek further coverage for the matters in the June&nbsp;14, 2002 MDEQ letter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Factors Which May Affect Future Results  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's future operating results and financial position may be adversely affected or fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis as a result of the
difficult commercial aviation environment exacerbated by the September&nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the events that followed, the relatively weak worldwide economic climate and other factors,
including: (1)&nbsp;decline in demand for the Company's products and services and the ability of the Company's customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company, particularly in light of
the poor financial condition of many of the world's commercial airlines; (2)&nbsp;lack of assurance that sales to the U.S. Government, its agencies and its contractors (which were approximately
25.5% of total sales in fiscal 2002), will continue at levels previously experienced, since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding; (3)&nbsp;access to the debt and
equity capital markets to finance growth, which may be limited in light of industry conditions and Company performance; (4)&nbsp;changes in or noncompliance with laws and regulations that may affect
certain of the Company's aviation related activities that are subject to licensing, certification and other regulatory requirements imposed by the FAA and other regulatory agencies, both domestic and
foreign; (5)&nbsp;competitors, including original equipment manufacturers, in the highly competitive aviation aftermarket industry that have greater financial resources than the Company;
(6)&nbsp;exposure to product liability and property claims that may be in excess of the Company's substantial liability insurance coverage; (7)&nbsp;difficulties in being able to successfully
integrate future business acquisitions; (8)&nbsp;fluctuating market values for aviation products and equipment in the current aviation environment; (9)&nbsp;difficulty in re-leasing or
selling aircraft and engines that are currently being leased on a long or short-term basis and (10)&nbsp;environmental proceedings as described in Item 3. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Critical Accounting Policies  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management of the
Company has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The most
significant estimates made by management of the Company include adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and equipment on or available for lease, allowance for doubtful accounts and loss
accruals for aviation equipment operating leases. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting policies considered
critical by management of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer
accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected. In determining the required allowance, the Company considers factors such as customer credit history, overall and industry economic conditions
and the customer's current financial performance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by either the specific identification,
average cost or first-in, first-out method. Provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories which have been impaired as a result of industry conditions.
The Company has utilized certain assumptions in determining the recoverability of excess, obsolete and impaired inventories, such as the historical performance of the inventory, existing and expected
future aviation usage trends, estimated market values and expected future demand. Principally as a result of the tragic events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, the Company recorded a significant charge
for impaired inventories during the second quarter ended November&nbsp;30, 2001 utilizing those assumptions. Further reductions in demand for certain of the Company's inventories or declining market
values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by the Company when determining the market value of assets, would result in additional impairment charges in future
periods. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment on or Available for Lease</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lease revenue is recognized as earned. The cost of the asset under lease is original
purchase price plus overhaul costs. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated service life of the equipment, and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred. The balance sheet classification is based on the lease term, with fixed-term leases less than twelve months classified as short-term and all others classified as
long-term. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aviation Equipment Operating Leases</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company from time to time leases aviation equipment (engines and aircraft) from
lessors under arrangements that are classified by the Company as operating leases. The Company may also sublease the aviation equipment to a customer on a short- or long-term basis. The
terms of the operating leases in which the Company is the lessee are one year with options to renew annually at the election of the Company for up to four years. If the Company elects not to renew a
lease, the Company may elect either to (i)&nbsp;direct the lessor to sell the equipment at which time the Company would be required to reimburse the lessor for the shortfall, if any, between the
proceeds on the sale and the scheduled purchase option price, or (ii)&nbsp;purchase the equipment from the lessor at its scheduled purchase option price. The terms of the lease agreements also allow
the Company to purchase the equipment at any time during a lease at its scheduled purchase option price. In those instances in which the Company anticipates that it will purchase aviation equipment
and that the scheduled purchase option price will exceed estimated undiscounted cash inflows related to the equipment, the Company records an accrual for loss. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Three-Year Sales Summary  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three fiscal years, consolidated sales, excluding pass through sales, decreased from $957,525 in fiscal 2000 to $638,721 in fiscal 2002. Total
sales, which include pass through sales, declined from $1,024,333 in fiscal 2000 to $638,721 in fiscal 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
fiscal 2001, the Company experienced lower demand for its products and services from its commercial airline customers as those customers experienced a decline in profitability as
a result of an overall economic slowdown and higher fuel prices. Sales were also lower in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 due to the mutual agreement with a major customer to unwind an engine
parts inventory management program in mid-fiscal 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of the tragic events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, which occurred at a time when the worldwide commercial airline environment was already under significant pressure
principally due to the aforementioned weak worldwide economic conditions, most of the major U.S. based commercial airlines announced substantial reductions in capacity, some in excess of 20%.
Commercial airlines accelerated their older generation aircraft fleet retirement plans. The reduction in capacity and the financial impact of September&nbsp;11, 2001 on the Company's commercial
airline customers had a dramatic effect on the Company's fiscal 2002 operating results when compared to fiscal 2001 and 2000. More recently, three major U.S. commercial airlines have announced
restructuring plans as a result of the continuing difficult economic conditions in the airline industry. One has filed bankruptcy as part of its restructuring plans and another has warned that it may
have to do so. These </FONT></P>

restructurings are likely to result in further reductions in industry capacity. The Company will review its business lines and capacity and take appropriate actions consistent with changing industry
demands. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal 2001  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated sales in fiscal 2002, excluding pass through sales, decreased $214,938 or 25.2% compared to fiscal 2001 as the Company experienced lower sales in
three of its four segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Inventory and Logistic Services segment, fiscal 2002 sales declined $108,495 or 29.6% primarily as a result of lower demand for engine and airframe parts from the Company's
customers due to reduced airline capacity, including the accelerated retirement of older generation aircraft, partially offset by increased sales of spares and logistic support for the U.S. military
and its contractors. The decline in engine parts sales was also due to lower sales to a major program customer for certain engine parts due principally to the impact of the dissolution of the
Company's exclusive engine parts support agreement with this major customer, which occurred in December&nbsp;2000. The elimination of pass through sales was also attributable to this factor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment, sales decreased $40,390 or 15.7% primarily due to the reduction in airline capacity, partially offset by the favorable
full-year impact of sales of Hermetic, which the Company acquired on September&nbsp;29, 2000. Fiscal 2002 and 2001 revenues for Hermetic included in consolidated sales were approximately
$18,750 and $13,100, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Manufacturing segment, sales increased $2,404 or 2.5% as the Company experienced increased shipments of products supporting the U.S. Military's tactical deployment requirements,
partially offset by lower sales of the Company's cargo loading systems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segment declined $68,457 or 51.5% primarily due to the commercial aviation industry-wide reduction in capital asset
investment activity reflecting the difficult commercial airline environment, including lack of available financing and fluctuating market values for aircraft and engines. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to September&nbsp;11, 2001 the Company was executing its plan to reduce its investment in support of older generation aircraft in line with the commercial airlines' scheduled
retirement plans for these aircraft. The events of September&nbsp;11 caused a severe and sudden disruption in the commercial airline industry which brought about a rapid acceleration of those
retirement plans. System-wide capacity had been reduced by approximately 20% and many airlines cancelled or deferred new aircraft deliveries. Based on management's assessment of these and
other conditions, the Company reduced the value and provided loss accruals for certain of its inventories and equipment leases which support older generation aircraft by $75,900 during the three-month
period ended November&nbsp;30, 2001. This charge is reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as "Cost of sales&#151;impairment charges". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the Company recorded other charges of $10,100 during the three-month period ended November&nbsp;30, 2001 principally related to an increase in the allowance for doubtful
accounts to reflect its inability to recover certain accounts receivable. This charge is reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as "Special charges". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated
gross profit before consideration of impairment charges decreased $46,719 or 34.2% as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin. The
reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was principally due to margin pressure experienced in the Inventory and Logistic Services and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segments, as well as
lower volume through most of the facilities within those two segments. The Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segment's gross profit percentage increased over the prior year due to the mix of
products sold. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating
income, before consideration of impairment and other special charges, decreased $35,679 from the prior year as a result of lower gross profit, partially offset by a reduction
in selling, general and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2002, the Company reduced its selling, general and administrative expenses by $11,040 or 11.5% through lower personnel costs and reduced
discretionary spending. Interest expense decreased $2,089 over the prior year principally as a result of lower average short-term borrowings outstanding during the year and interest income
increased $1,141 over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in average cash invested. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated sales in fiscal 2001, excluding pass through sales, decreased $103,866 or 10.8% compared to the prior year as the Company experienced lower sales in
three of its four segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Inventory and Logistic Services segment, fiscal 2001 sales declined $39,491 or 9.7% compared to fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of lower sales of engine parts and components.
The decline in engine parts sales was primarily the result of reduced demand by a major customer for certain engine parts due principally to fewer engine shop visits to this customer for the engine
types the Company supports, and from the impact of converting the Company's exclusive engine parts support agreement with this major customer to preferred status, which occurred in
December&nbsp;2000. The reduction in pass through sales of $46,212 also was attributable to these factors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment, fiscal 2001 sales increased over the prior year $16,843 or 7.0%, primarily as a result of the favorable impact of the sales of Hermetic,
which the Company acquired on September&nbsp;29, 2000. Fiscal 2001 revenues for Hermetic included in consolidated sales were approximately $13,100. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
in the Manufacturing segment declined $22,779 or 19.0% compared to fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of lower sales of products supporting the U.S. Government's rapid deployment
program, and lower sales of the Company's cargo systems and composite structure products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segment, sales declined $58,439 or 30.6% compared to fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of lower revenue in the Company's aircraft sales
business. The decline in aircraft sales is mainly due to the type of aircraft sold in fiscal 2001 compared to those sold in fiscal 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated
gross profit decreased $36,386 or 21.1% over the prior year due to the impact of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin. The decline in the
gross profit margin was attributable to lower margins in the Inventory and Logistic Services segment due to pricing pressure on older technology engine parts and reduced demand from a major inventory
management program customer. Gross profit margins were also lower in the Manufacturing segment reflecting lower demand for certain of the Company's manufactured products. The consolidated gross profit
margin was also negatively impacted by a $5,400 provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to adjust certain inventories previously used to support the major program customer to their net
realizable value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling,
general and administrative costs declined $6,118 or 6.0% reflecting lower personnel costs as the Company reduced its cost structure in response to more difficult industry
conditions. Selling, general and administrative expense declined also as a result of lower bad debt expense in fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year. Interest expense decreased $1,544 principally as
a result of reduced average short-term borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2001. Interest income declined $582 as a result of the reduction in average outstanding interest-bearing trade
notes receivable during the current year compared to the prior year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal 2001 was 8.4% compared to 29.0% for fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision for income taxes includes a reduction in income tax expense
of $3,300. This adjustment represents the reversal of Federal and state income tax accrued liabilities for years prior to fiscal 1998, which are now closed to assessments. </FONT></P>

debt in June&nbsp;2001 and a common stock offering in February&nbsp;2002, the Company's ability to issue debt, borrow from its lenders or sell equity securities in the future may be negatively
affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, aviation industry conditions and Company performance. The Company's ability to use the accounts receivable securitization
program and aviation equipment operating leases is also dependent on those factors. The Company's ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by the operating performance of the
Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
May&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company's liquidity and capital resources included cash of $34,522 and working capital of $286,192. At May&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company's ratio of
long-term debt to capitalization was 41.2%, up from 34.6% at May&nbsp;31, 2001 and at May&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company's ratio of total debt to capitalization was 45.6% compared to 36.3%
at May&nbsp;31, 2001. The increase in the long-term debt to capitalization ratio is primarily attributable to the reduction in stockholders' equity as a result of the impairment and
special charges recorded in the second quarter ended November&nbsp;30, 2001. The Company continues to maintain its external sources of financing, including committed bank lines and a universal shelf
registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which, subject to market conditions, up to $163,675 of common stock, preferred stock or medium- or long-term debt
securities may be issued or sold. </FONT></P>

May&nbsp;31, 2002, aggregate committed unsecured bank credit arrangements were $117,110. Of this amount, $115,000 was available under revolving credit and term loan agreements with
four domestic banks and $2,110 was available under credit agreements with one foreign bank. Borrowings outstanding under these arrangements were $40,500 and $0 at May&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Two of the domestic credit agreements have commitment amounts that reduce by $5,000 each every six months, beginning June&nbsp;29, 2002 until the time of their maturity. The aggregate

permit the Company to finance future growth, the Company is actively considering various financing alternatives which, depending on market conditions and the availability of capital,
may include the issuance of debt or equity securities. The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program under which the Company may sell an interest in a defined pool of accounts
receivable. Cash proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable, net of retained interest, under this arrangement were $20,100 and $18,984, at May&nbsp;31, 2002 and May&nbsp;31, 2001 respectively.
This resulted in a reduction of accounts receivable in those amounts on the May&nbsp;31, 2002 and May&nbsp;31, 2001 Consolidated Balance&nbsp;Sheets. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During

issuance of a $75,000 private placement of long-term debt in June&nbsp;2001, a common stock offering in February&nbsp;2002 which provided the Company with net proceeds of $34,334, and
an increase in borrowings under its bank lines of $40,500. The increase to cash was partially offset by a final cash payment of $13,251 for the acquisition of Hermetic and the repayment of $65,000 in
notes on November&nbsp;1, 2001. Also contributing to the net change in the Company's cash position were capital expenditures of $12,112, cash dividends of $4,430 and cash used in operating

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains certain statements relating to future results, which are
forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on beliefs of Company management, as well as
assumptions and estimates based on information currently available to the Company, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
historical results or those anticipated, depending on a variety of factors, including those factors discussed under this Item 7 entitled "Factors Which May Affect Future Results". Should one or more
of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described. Those events and
uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond the Company's control. The Company assumes no obligation to publicly release the result of any
revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under its unsecured bank credit agreements, foreign exchange rates and accounts
receivable. See Item 7 "Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, the Company did not utilize derivative financial instruments to
offset these risks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
May&nbsp;31, 2002, $70,485 was available under credit lines with domestic banks under revolving credit and term loan agreements, and $1,795 was available under credit agreements
with foreign banks (credit facilities). Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facilities is LIBOR based. As of May&nbsp;31, 2002, the outstanding balance under these agreements was $40,500.
A hypothetical 10&nbsp;percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during fiscal 2002 would have reduced the Company's
pre-tax income by approximately $108 during fiscal 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues
and expenses of the Company's foreign operations in The Netherlands are translated at average exchange rates during the year and balance sheet accounts are translated at
year-end exchange rates. Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). A hypothetical 10&nbsp;percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would not have a material impact on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AAR CORP. and subsidiaries as of May&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May&nbsp;31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AAR CORP. and subsidiaries as of
May&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May&nbsp;31, 2002 in conformity with

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAR CORP. ("the Company") supplies a variety of products and services to the worldwide aviation/aerospace industry. Products and services are sold primarily to
commercial, domestic and foreign airlines; business aircraft operators; aviation original equipment manufacturers; aircraft leasing companies; domestic and foreign military agencies and independent
aviation support companies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales and related cost of sales for product sales are recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer. Service revenues and the related cost of services
are generally recognized when customer owned material is shipped to the customer. Sales and related cost of sales on long-term manufacturing contracts and on certain large airframe
maintenance contracts are recognized by the percentage of completion method, based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs under the respective contracts. Lease revenues
are recognized as earned. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to fiscal 2002, in connection with certain long-term inventory management programs, the Company purchased factory-new products on behalf of customers from
original equipment manufacturers. These products were purchased from the manufacturer, included in the Company's inventory, and "passed through" to the customer at the Company's cost. These sales are
reported as "pass through" sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal 2001, these inventory management programs were discontinued and as a result the Company no longer has pass
through sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.&nbsp;141 "Business Combinations"
effective for business combinations after June&nbsp;30, 2001, and SFAS No.&nbsp;142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2001.
SFAS No.&nbsp;141 requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no
longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Early adoption of
SFAS No.&nbsp;142 was permitted for companies with a fiscal year beginning after March&nbsp;2001, provided that the first quarter financial statements had not previously been issued. The Company
adopted these statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;142, the Company did not record any goodwill amortization for the fiscal year ended
May&nbsp;31, 2002. If goodwill amortization not been recorded for the fiscal years ended May&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, net income and earnings per share would have been as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries, a special purpose entity, has an agreement (securitization) with a major financial institution to sell an undivided interest in its
accounts receivable up to $35,000. The agreement involves the sale of accounts receivable by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries to the special purpose entity which in turn sells the
accounts receivable to the financial institution. Accounts receivable greater than 120&nbsp;days past due are not eligible to be sold to the financial institution. The Company retains collection and
administrative responsibilities for the accounts receivable sold. The accounts receivable securitization program expires on August&nbsp;30, 2004. However, on an annual basis, the financial
institution has the option to not renew funding of the program. The financial institution has informed the Company that it does not wish to renew funding of the program effective November&nbsp;30,
2002. The Company is in discussions with other financial institutions regarding funding this program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
May&nbsp;31, 2002, accounts receivable sold under the program were $30,918, and the cash proceeds from the transaction were $20,100. This resulted in a $20,100 reduction in accounts
receivable on the May&nbsp;31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet. At May&nbsp;31, 2001, accounts receivable sold under the program were $30,455 and the cash proceeds were $18,984. This resulted in
an $18,984 reduction in accounts receivable on the May&nbsp;31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet. The retained undivided interest of $10,818 and $11,471 as of May&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, are included in accounts receivable at fair value, which takes into consideration expected credit losses based on the specific identification of uncollectable accounts. Since
substantially all accounts receivable sold carry 30&nbsp;day payment terms, the retained interest is not discounted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of market or credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. While the
Company's trade receivables are diverse based on the number of entities and geographic regions, the majority are with the U.S. Government, its agencies and contractors and entities in the
aviation/aerospace industry. The Company performs evaluations of customers' financial condition prior to extending credit privileges and performs ongoing credit evaluations of payment experience,
current financial condition and risk analysis. The Company typically requires collateral in the form of security interests in assets, letters of credit, and/or obligation guarantees from financial
institutions for transactions other than on normal trade terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS
No.&nbsp;107 "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value because of the short-term
maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt bearing a variable interest rate approximates fair market value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to September&nbsp;11, 2001 the Company was executing its plan to reduce its investment in support of older generation aircraft in line with the commercial
airlines' scheduled retirement plans for these aircraft. The events of September&nbsp;11 caused a severe and sudden disruption in the commercial airline industry, which brought about a rapid
acceleration of those retirement plans. System-wide capacity was reduced by approximately 20% and many airlines cancelled or deferred new aircraft deliveries. Based on management's
assessment of these and other conditions, the Company reduced the value and provided loss accruals for certain of its inventories and equipment leases which support older generation aircraft by
$75,900, of which $57,900 is related to the Inventory and Logistic Services segment and $18,000 is related to the Aircraft and Engine Sales and Leasing segment. This charge was recorded on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations during the three-month period ended November&nbsp;30, 2001 as "Cost of sales&#151;impairment charges". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

accounts to reflect its inability to recover certain accounts receivable. This charge is reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as "Special charges". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is subject to a number of covenants under the revolving credit and term loan agreements, including restrictions which relate to the payment of cash dividends, maintenance of
minimum net working capital and tangible net worth levels, fixed charge coverage ratio, sales of assets, additional financing, purchase of the Company's shares and other matters. The Company is in
compliance with all restrictive financial provisions of the agreements. At May&nbsp;31, 2002, unrestricted consolidated retained earnings available for payment of dividends and purchase of the
Company's
shares was approximately $32,413. Effective June&nbsp;1, 2002, unrestricted consolidated retained earnings decreased to $2,943 due to inclusion of 50% of the consolidated net loss of the Company for
fiscal 2002. The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing during each of the next five fiscal years is $2,025 in 2003, $53,037 in 2004, $1,915 in 2005, $20,817 in 2006 and $4,615 in
2007. The Company's long-term debt was estimated to have a fair value of approximately $217,335 at May&nbsp;31, 2002 and was based on estimates using discounted future cash flows at an
assumed rate for borrowings currently prevailing in the marketplace for similar instruments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
June&nbsp;7, 2001, the Company completed a $75,000 private placement of long-term debt, including $55,000 of ten-year Senior Notes at 8.39% due
May&nbsp;15, 2011 and $20,000 of seven-year Senior Notes at 7.98% due May&nbsp;15, 2008. The Company's $65,000 of 9.5% notes matured and were paid in full on November&nbsp;1, 2001. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, the Company completed amendments to certain of its credit agreements. The principal changes were to reduce the term of the agreements
and reduce required minimum net worth in the net worth financial covenant. These changes were made to reflect current market terms on similar credit agreements and to provide more flexibility under
the covenant calculation, due to the impairment and special charges recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. </FONT></P>

fiscal 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded reductions in income tax expense of $2,000 and $3,300, respectively. These adjustments represent the reversal of Federal and state

Company has established stock option plans for officers and key employees of the Company. Stock option awards typically expire ten years from the date of grant or earlier upon
termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on successive grant anniversary dates at the New York Stock Exchange closing common stock price on the date of grant and are
accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals, stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company accounts for these plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized. Pro forma information regarding net
income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No.&nbsp;123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS
No.&nbsp;123. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: </FONT></P>

AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock awards. Restrictions are released at the end of applicable restricted periods. The number of shares and
the restricted period, which varies from three to ten years, are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. At the date of grant, the market value of the award (based on the
New York Stock Exchange common stock closing price) is recorded in common stock and capital surplus; an offsetting amount is recorded as a component of stockholders' equity in unearned restricted
stock awards. Compensation cost is included in results of operations over the vesting period. Expense (income) relating to outstanding restricted stock award for the three-year period

to a shareholder rights plan adopted in 1997, each outstanding share of the Company's common stock carries with it a Right to purchase one and one half additional shares at a
price of $83.33 per share. The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock by a person or
group (an
"Acquiring Person") or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more of the common stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that an Acquiring Person acquires 15% or more of the common stock, or if the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger involving an Acquiring Person or if the
Acquiring Person engages in certain types of self-dealing transactions, each Right entitles the holder to purchase, for $83.33 per share (or the then-current exercise price),
shares of the Company's common stock having a market value of $166.66 (or two times the exercise price), subject to certain exceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination or 50% or more of its assets or earning power is sold, each Right entitles the holder to purchase at the then-current exercise price that number of shares of common
stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of two times the exercise price. The Rights do not entitle the holder thereof to vote or to receive dividends. The Rights will expire on
August&nbsp;6, 2007, and may be redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right under certain circumstances. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
September&nbsp;21, 1990, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares (adjusted for a three-for-two stock split) of the
Company's common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. On October&nbsp;13, 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional
shares of the Company's common stock. As of May&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company had purchased 1,745,000 shares of its common stock on the open market under these programs at an average price of $14.00

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has defined contribution and defined benefit plans covering substantially all full-time domestic employees and certain employees in The
Netherlands. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2000, the pension plan for domestic salaried and non-union hourly employees had a benefit formula primarily based on years
of service and compensation. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2000, the Company converted its existing defined benefit plan for substantially all domestic salaried employees to a cash balance pension plan.
Under the cash balance pension plan, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in an account that grows with annual pay-based credits and interest on the account balance. The
pension benefit for certain union hourly employees is generally based on a fixed amount per year of service. The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;87 "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions" and SFAS No.&nbsp;132 "Employer's Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" for all pension and postretirement plans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's funding policy for domestic plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes and that is sufficient to meet
actuarially computed pension benefits. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date and for benefits expected to be earned in the future. The assets of the pension
plans are invested primarily in mutual funds, common stocks, investment grade bonds and U.S. Government obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
foreign operations of domestic subsidiaries also have pension plans. In most cases, the plans are defined benefit in nature. Assets of the plans are comprised of insurance
contracts. Benefit formulas are based generally on years of service and compensation. It is the policy of these subsidiaries to fund at least the minimum amounts required by local law and regulation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company provides its outside directors with benefits upon retirement on or after age 65 provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director. Benefits are paid
quarterly in cash in an amount equal to 25.0% of the annual retainer fee payable by the Company to active outside directors. Payment of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a period
equal to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to a maximum of ten years, or death, whichever occurs first. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company
terminated this plan for any new members of the Board of Directors elected after May&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company also provides supplemental retirement and profit sharing benefits for current and former executives and key employees to supplement benefits provided by the Company's other
benefit plans. The plans are not funded and may require funding in the event of a change in control of the Company as determined by the Company's Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended to qualify as a 401(k) plan under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees
may contribute up to 15.0% of their pretax compensation, subject to applicable regulatory limits. The Company may make matching contributions up to 5.0% of compensation. Participants vest on a
pro-rata basis in Company contributions during the first three years of employment. Expense charged to results of operations was $1,391, $1,550 and $1,634 in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees and retirees under a variety of plans. Generally, these benefits are
contributory with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement plans are unfunded, and the Company has the right to modify or terminate any of these plans in the future, in certain
cases, subject to union bargaining agreements. In fiscal 1995, the Company completed termination of postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits attributable to future services of collective
bargaining and other domestic employees. </FONT></P>

assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25% at May&nbsp;31, 2002 and 7.75% at May&nbsp;31, 2001. The assumed rate of future
increases in healthcare costs was 10.0% and 6.8% in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively, declining to 5.0% by the year 2004 and remaining at that rate thereafter. A one percent increase in the assumed
healthcare cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $25 as of May&nbsp;31, 2002, and would not result in a significant change to the annual
postretirement benefit expense. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company occasionally leases aviation equipment (engines and aircraft) from lessors under arrangements that are classified by the Company as operating leases.
The Company may also sublease the aviation equipment to a customer on a short- or long-term basis. The terms of the operating leases in which the Company is the lessee are one year with
options to renew annually at the election of the Company for up to four years. If the Company elects not to renew a lease, the Company may elect either to (1)&nbsp;direct the lessor to sell the
equipment at which time the Company would be required to reimburse the lessor for the shortfall, if any, between the proceeds on the sale and the scheduled purchase option price, or
(2)&nbsp;purchase the equipment from the lessor at its scheduled purchase option price. The terms of the lease agreements also allow the Company to purchase the equipment at any time during a lease
at its scheduled purchase option price. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
those instances in which the Company anticipates that it will purchase aviation equipment and that the scheduled purchase option price will exceed the fair value of such equipment,
the Company records an accrual for loss. The scheduled purchase option values amounted to $35,623 at May&nbsp;31, 2002 and $87,585 at May&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the fourth quarter, the Company purchased the equity interest in $31,080 of aviation equipment. As a result, this amount was recorded as an asset on the May&nbsp;31, 2002
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The lease obligations for these assets converted to term loans in the amount of $29,737, which is also recorded on the May&nbsp;31, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(See also Note&nbsp;3) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments and Contingencies  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to aviation equipment operating leases, the Company leases certain facilities and equipment under agreements which are classified as operating leases
that expire at various dates through 2011. Future minimum payments and sublease income under all operating leases at May&nbsp;31, 2002, are as follows: </FONT></P>

     in the following respect:

          Article II, Section 1, of the By-Laws be amended to read as follows:

               "SECTION 1. TIME. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
          corporation for the election of directors and the transaction of such
          other business as may properly come before such meeting shall be held
          each year on the fourth Wednesday in September at 10:00 a.m. (Chicago

          day not a legal holiday, or shall be held on such other time and date
          as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. A special meeting of
          the stockholders shall be held on the date and at the time fixed by

          such meeting."

     This Amendment has been executed by the Company by its duly authorized
officer this 13th day of May, 2002 and attested by its Secretary.

   insertions, requesting that the Revolving Credit Termination Date be extended
   for one year. Such request for an extension of the Revolving Credit

   permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole or in part ratably among
   the Lenders in integral multiples of $1,000,000, upon at least 10 days'
   written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any
   such reduction, provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate
   Commitment may not be reduced below the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of
   the outstanding Advances. All accrued interest and fees shall be payable on
   the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to
   make Loans hereunder.......................................................21

   without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a
   minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of $100,000
   in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon
   5 days' prior notice to the Agent. Fixed Rate Advances may be paid prior to
   the last day of the applicable Interest Period, subject to compliance with
   SECTION 3.4; PROVIDED, however, that Quoted Rate Advances may not be repaid

   of maturity................................................................22
   2.10.   METHOD OF SELECTING TYPES AND INTEREST PERIODS FOR NEW U.S. DOLLAR

   Eurodollar Advance or Quoted Rate Advance, the Interest Period applicable to
   each new Advance from time to time. The Borrower shall give the Agent

   time to time in accordance with this Section 2.11 request the Lenders to make
   one or more Alternate Currency Advances. The Lenders shall have no obligation
   to make any such Alternate Currency Advance so requested by the Borrower. If,
   and only if, each of the Lenders in its sole and absolute discretion agrees,
   in the manner provided for in this Section 2.11, to make its respective Loan
   comprising any such Alternate Currency Advance, will such Alternate Currency
   Advance be made............................................................23

   Article XIII and (ii) in the case of a Loan denominated in an Alternate
   Currency, not later than noon (local time), in the city of the Agent's
   Lending Installation for such Alternate Currency, in such funds as may then
   be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such
   currency in the city of and at the address of the Agent's Lending
   Installation for such currency. The Agent will make the funds so received
   from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
   address....................................................................24

                                      - 3 -
<Page>

   another Type as provided below in this Section 2.13; PROVIDED, that
   notwithstanding anything else in this Section 2.13 to the contrary, (a)
   outstanding U.S. Dollar Advances may not be converted into Alternate Currency
   Advances pursuant to this Section 2.13 and (b) outstanding Alternate Currency
   Advances may not be continued or converted pursuant to this Section 2.13, but
   must be repaid on or prior to the last day of their respective Interest
   Periods pursuant to SECTION 2.3(a) and may only be reborrowed pursuant to
   SECTIONS 2.1(b) and 2.11...................................................24
   2.14.   RESTRICTIONS ON INTEREST PERIODS. No Interest Period may extend
   beyond a Payment Date on which principal of the Advances shall be payable
   unless outstanding principal of Floating Rate Advances and Fixed Rate
   Advances with Interest Periods ending prior to said Payment Date shall be at
   least equal to the amount so payable. No Interest Period shall extend beyond
   the Facility Termination Date. No more than 10 Interest Periods may be in
   effect at any one time. No more than three Quoted Rate Interest Periods may
   be in effect at any one time...............................................26
   2.15.   CHANGES IN INTEREST RATE, ETC. Changes in the rate of interest on
   that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take
   effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate and each
   change in the Applicable Margin applicable thereto. Each Fixed Rate Advance
   shall bear interest from and including the first day of the Interest 26
   Period applicable thereto to but excluding the last day of such Interest
   Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such Fixed Rate
   Advance, provided that the rate of interest on each Eurodollar Advance will
   change simultaneously with each change, during the applicable Eurodollar
   Interest Period, of the Applicable Margin..................................26
   2.16.   RATES APPLICABLE AFTER DEFAULT. During the continuance of a Default
   the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which
   notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding
   any provision of SECTION 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to
   changes in interest rates), declare that (i) each Fixed Rate Advance shall
   bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate
   otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each
   Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
   Floating Rate otherwise applicable to the Floating Rate Advance plus 2% per
   annum......................................................................26
   2.17.   METHOD OF PAYMENT. (a) All payments of principal, interest and fees
   to be made by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes in U.S. Dollars shall
   be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available
   funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to ARTICLE XIII,
   or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the
   Agent to the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be
   applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the
   Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent
   to such Lender in the same type of funds which the Agent received at such
   Lender's address specified pursuant to ARTICLE XIII or at any Lending
   Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender..26
   2.18.   FOREIGN TAXES. (a) All payments made by the Borrower in respect of
   principal of and interest on the Advances and of all other amounts payable by
   it under this Agreement are payable without deduction for or on account of
   any present or future taxes, duties, withholdings or other charges levied or
   imposed by the government of any jurisdiction outside

                                      - 4 -
<Page>

   the United States of America or by any political subdivision or taxing
   authority thereof or therein (herein called "FOREIGN TAXES"). If the Borrower
   shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Foreign Taxes from any
   such amount payable by it hereunder or under any of the Notes to or for the
   account of any Lender, (i) such amount shall be increased as may be necessary
   so that, after making such deductions or withholdings (including any
   deductions or withholdings applicable to additional amounts payable pursuant
   to this Section), such Lender receives an amount equal to the amount it would
   have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made and (ii) the
   Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings and pay the amount
   thereof to the relevant government, political subdivision or taxing authority
   at or prior to the time required to be paid under applicable law (and shall
   promptly furnish to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, official
   receipts evidencing such payment). In addition, the Borrower will pay any
   present or future stamp or documentary taxes or similar taxes or levies
   imposed by any government, political subdivision or taxing authority referred
   to in the first sentence of this subsection arising from any payment by it
   hereunder or under any of the Notes or from the execution, delivery or
   registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any of the
   Notes (herein called "OTHER TAXES"). The Borrower will indemnify each Lender
   and the Agent for, and hold each Lender and the Agent harmless against, the
   full amount of Foreign Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation,
   any Foreign Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
   payable under this Section) paid or payable by such Lender or the Agent and
   any liability of such Lender or the Agent relating thereto (including,
   without limitation, penalties, interest and expenses)......................27
   2.19.   JUDGMENT CURRENCY. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
   court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder or
   under any of the Notes in the currency expressed to be payable herein or
   under the Notes (the "SPECIFIED CURRENCY") into another currency, the parties
   hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the
   rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
   banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such
   other currency at the Agent's main Chicago office on the Business Day
   preceding that on which final, nonappealable judgment is given. The
   obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the
   Agent hereunder or under any Note shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a
   currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent
   that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as
   the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such
   Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal,
   reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other
   currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than
   the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), in
   the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it
   may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
   judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against
   such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds
   (a) the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
   in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a
   result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such
   Lender under SECTION 11.2, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
   agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower................................28

   2.20.   NOTES; TELEPHONIC NOTICES. Each Lender shall, and is hereby
   authorized to, record the principal amount of each of its Loans and each
   repayment on the schedule attached to its Note (or to otherwise record the
   same in its usual practice) provided, however, that the failure to so record
   shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. The
   Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or
   continue U.S. Dollar Advances (it being understood and agreed that Alternate
   Currency Borrowing Requests must be in writing or by facsimile) and to
   transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the
   Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the
   Borrower. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written
   confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender,
   of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written
   confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the
   Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
   absent manifest error......................................................29
   2.21.   INTEREST PAYMENT DATES; INTEREST AND FEE BASIS. Interest accrued on
   each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
   with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which
   the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or
   otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the
   outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a
   Eurodollar Advance or Quoted Rate Advance on a day other than a Payment Date
   shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Fixed
   Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest
   Period, on any date on which the Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by
   acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed
   Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be
   payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest
   Period. Interest and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the
   basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is
   made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is
   received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment
   of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is
   not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
   Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time
   shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment....29
   2.22.   NOTIFICATION OF ADVANCES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS AND COMMITMENT
   REDUCTIONS. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender
   of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing
   Notice, Alternate Currency Borrowing Request, Continuation/Conversion Notice
   and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each
   Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly
   upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt
   notice of each change in the Alternate Reference Rate......................30
   2.23.   LENDING INSTALLATIONS. Each Lender may book its Loans at any one or
   more Lending Installations selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
   Installation(s) from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to
   any such Lending Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each
   Lender for the benefit of such Lending Installation(s). Each Lender may from
   time to time, by written or facsimile notice to the Agent and the Borrower,
   designate a new Lending Installation through which Loans (or Loans in a
   particular currency)

                                      - 6 -
<Page>

   will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments (or Loan payments in a
   particular currency) are to be made. The Agent may from time to time, by
   written or facsimile notice to the Borrower and each Lender, designate a new
   Lending Installation at which Advances (or Advances in a particular currency)
   will be made available to the Borrower and at which payments on the Advances
   (or payments on Advances in a particular currency) are to be made by the
   Borrower...................................................................30
   2.24.   NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE AGENT. Unless the Borrower or a Lender,
   as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
   scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
   proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of
   principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that
   it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such
   payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the
   amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon
   such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not
   in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall,
   on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available
   together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
   commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until
   the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in
   the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such
   day or (ii) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate
   applicable to the relevant Loan............................................30
   2.25.   WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION. At least five Business Days prior to the
   first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of
   any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
   States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of
   the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States
   Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that
   such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the
   Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
   taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes
   to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of
   such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires
   (currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one calendar
   year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event
   requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such
   amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
   requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such
   Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes
   without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes,
   unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or
   regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
   otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
   would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
   with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it
   is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of
   United States federal income tax...........................................31

   3.1.    YIELD PROTECTION. If any law or any governmental or
   quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether
   or not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the
   compliance of any Lender therewith.........................................31
   3.2.    CHANGES IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS. If a Lender determines the
   amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
   Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such
   Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below), then, within
   15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the
   amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the
   portion ...................................................................32
   of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to
   this Agreement, its Loans or its obligation to make Loans hereunder (after
   taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "CHANGE"
   means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based
   Capital Guidelines (as defined below) or (ii) any adoption of or change in
   any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy,
   guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of
   law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital
   required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending
   Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "RISK-BASED CAPITAL
   GUIDELINES" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the
   United States on the date of this Agreement, including transition rules, and
   (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory
   authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of
   the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled
   "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards,"
   including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted
   prior to the date of this Agreement........................................32
   3.3.    AVAILABILITY OF EURODOLLAR ADVANCES. If (i) any Lender determines
   that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
   would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or
   not having the force of law, (ii) the Required Lenders determine that
   deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances
   are not available or (iii) the Required Lenders determine that the interest
   rate applicable to a Eurodollar Advance does not accurately reflect the cost
   of making or maintaining such Eurodollar Advance, then the Agent shall
   suspend the availability of any new Eurodollar Advances (whether pursuant to
   SECTION 2.10 or 2.13)......................................................32
   3.4.    FUNDING INDEMNIFICATION. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance
   occurs on a date prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
   whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate
   Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower in its Borrowing
   Notice, Alternate Currency Borrowing Request or Continuation/Conversion
   Notice, as the case may be, as a consequence of any condition precedent to
   such Advance under SECTION 2.1 or ARTICLE IV not being satisfied or as a
   consequence of any failure by the Borrower to borrow such Advance when the
   same has been made available to it pursuant to SECTION 2.12, the Borrower
   will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost in liquidating or employing
   deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Fixed Rate Advance and, provided
   that such Lender has taken such reasonable action, if any, not
   disadvantageous to it, to mitigate the same, any other loss or cost incurred
   by such Lender resulting therefrom.........................................32

   3.5.    LENDER STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. To the extent reasonably
   possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
   respect to its Fixed Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to
   such Lender under SECTIONS 2.18, 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability
   of Eurodollar Advances under SECTION 3.3, so long as such designation is not
   disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement
   of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under SECTION 2.18, 3.1, 3.2 or
   3.4. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail (and in
   accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, where applicable) the
   calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be
   final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest
   error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection
   with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its
   Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity
   corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
   Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, whether in fact that is
   the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in
   the written statement shall be payable on demand after receipt by the
   Borrower of the written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under
   SECTIONS 2.18, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the obligations and
   termination of this Agreement..............................................33
   3.6.    REFUND TO BORROWER. If, and to the extent that, any Lender shall
   actually receive a credit against its United States federal income tax
   liability or otherwise receive any rebate or refund from any government or
   governmental agency in respect of any amount paid by the Borrower pursuant to
   SECTION 3.1 or 3.2, such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Borrower
   thereof and make reimbursement of credit, rebate or refund to the Borrower,
   provided that if such Lender reasonably believes that such credit, rebate or
   refund may be subject to challenge, then such Lender shall thereupon enter
   into negotiations in good faith with the Borrower to determine when
   reimbursement of such credit, rebate or refund can be made to the
   Borrower...................................................................33

   5.3.    NO CONFLICT; GOVERNMENT CONSENT. Neither the execution and delivery
   by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the

   Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles of incorporation or by-laws or the
   provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or
   any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its
   property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or
   result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the property of
   the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,

   being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been
   provided or (b) do not in the aggregate exceed $4,000,000 and the failure to
   file or pay for which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
   Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, the United States income tax returns
   of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal
   Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended 1992. No tax liens have been
   filed other than those permitted pursuant to SECTION 6.16(a). The charges,

   issued and are fully paid and non-assessable...............................36
   5.9.    ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do not

   incur any withdrawal liability to Multiemployer Plans in an aggregate amount

   Employer Plans, would exceed of $10,000,000. Each Plan complies in all
   material respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations and
   no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan. Neither the
   Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any
   Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize
   or terminate any Plan......................................................36
   5.10.   ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. No information, exhibit or report furnished
   by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or any Lender in

   fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
   misleading.................................................................36
   5.11.   REGULATION U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes
   less than 25% of those assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are

   5.12.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have complied
   in all respects with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
   restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
   agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
   businesses or the ownership of their respective properties, except where
   failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
   Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to
   the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with any of the
   requirements of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and
   safety statutes and regulations or the subject of any federal or state
   investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to
   a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment,

   a Material Adverse Effect..................................................37
   5.13.   INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary

   "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
   1940, as amended...........................................................37
   5.14.   YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. The Borrower has conducted a comprehensive

   making inquiry of its material suppliers, vendors and customers with respect
   to the Year 2000 Issue (as such term is defined

                                     - 11 -
<Page>

   below). Based on the foregoing review, the Borrower reasonably believes that
   the Year 2000 Issue, as it relates to the Borrower's computer applications,
   will not result in a Material Adverse Effect. "Year 2000 Issue" means, with
   respect to any Person, the ability or inability of all computer applications
   material to such Person's business and operations properly to perform
   date-sensitive functions for all dates before and after January 1, 2000. The
   Borrower is unable to determine the ultimate impact, if any, on the
   Borrower's operations resulting from the Year 2000 Issue relating to material
   suppliers, vendors and customers...........................................37

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES................................51
   8.1.    ACCELERATION. If any Default described in SECTION 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
   with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
   hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
   become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the
   Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders may
   terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder,
   or by written notice to the Borrower declare the Obligations to be due and
   payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and
   payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind,
   all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives. The Required Lenders agree
   to give the Borrower prompt subsequent notice of any termination or
   suspension of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder;
   PROVIDED, that the giving of such notice shall not be a condition to the
   effectiveness of any such termination or suspension........................51

   Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required

   waiving any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental
   agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender affected thereby:......51
   8.3.    PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
   Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right
   or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and
   the making of a Loan notwithstanding the

                                     - 15 -
<Page>

   existence of a Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the
   conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or
   acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
   preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

     Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff
     provided in SECTION 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating
     interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each
     Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
     provided in SECTION 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount
     received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to

     substantially in the form of EXHIBIT "H" hereto. Unless a Default has
     occurred and is continuing, the written consent of the Borrower and the
     Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with

Termination Date. No more than 10 Interest Periods may be in effect at any one
time. No more than three Quoted Rate Interest Periods may be in effect at any
one time.

     2.15.   CHANGES IN INTEREST RATE, ETC. Changes in the rate of interest on
that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take
effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate and each
change in the Applicable Margin applicable thereto. Each Fixed Rate Advance
shall bear interest from and including the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to but excluding the last day of such Interest Period at the
interest rate determined as applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance, provided that
the rate of interest on each Eurodollar Advance will change simultaneously with
each change, during the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period, of the Applicable
Margin.

     2.16.   RATES APPLICABLE AFTER DEFAULT. During the continuance of a Default
the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which
notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any
provision of SECTION 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes
in interest rates), declare that (i) each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest
for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise
applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each Floating Rate
Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate
otherwise applicable to the Floating Rate Advance plus 2% per annum.

     2.17.   METHOD OF PAYMENT. (a) All payments of principal, interest and fees
to be made by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes in U.S. Dollars shall be
made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds
to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to ARTICLE XIII, or at
any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to
the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be applied
ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Agent for
the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such
Lender in the same type of funds which the Agent received at such Lender's
address specified pursuant to ARTICLE XIII or at any Lending Installation
specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender.

     (b)     Each Advance shall be repaid or prepaid in the currency in which it
was made in the amount borrowed and interest payable thereon shall be paid in
such currency. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder or under the
Notes in any Alternate Currency shall be made in such Alternate Currency on the
date due in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of
international transactions in such Alternate Currency for the account of the
Agent, at its Lending Installation for such Alternate Currency. The Agent will
promptly cause such payments to be distributed to each Lender in like funds and
currency at such Lender's address specified pursuant to ARTICLE XIII or at any
Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such
Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the
making of any Advance in any Alternate Currency, currency control or exchange
regulations

                                     - 26 -
<Page>

are imposed in the country which issues such Alternate Currency with the result
that different types of such Alternate Currency (the "New Currency") are
introduced and the type of Alternate Currency in which the Advance was made (the
"Original Currency") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make
payment to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency,
then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes in
such Alternate Currency shall be made in such amount and such type of the New
Currency as shall be equivalent to the amount of such payment otherwise due
hereunder or under the Notes in the Original Currency, it being the intention of
the Borrower and the Lenders that the Borrower take all risks of the imposition
of any such currency control or exchange regulations.

     (c)     On or before the time a principal payment is made on any of the
Advances, the Borrower shall inform the Agent as to the proportionate
application of such payment among the Floating Rate Advances, the Eurodollar
Advances, the Quoted Rate Advances and the Alternate Currency Advances. In the
absence of such instructions, the Agent shall apply such payment first to the
outstanding Floating Rate Advances and then apply any remainder to the
outstanding Eurodollar Advances, Quoted Rate Advances and Alternate Currency
Advances in whatever proportion it shall determine in its sole discretion;
PROVIDED, that as between Eurodollar Advances, as between Quoted Rate Advances
and as between Alternate Currency Advances of the same Alternate Currency, the
Agent shall endeavor to make such application (not otherwise disadvantageous to
the Agent or the Lenders) as will mitigate the Borrower's liability to the
Lenders under SECTION 3.4 as a consequence of such application.

     2.18.   FOREIGN TAXES. (a) All payments made by the Borrower in respect of
principal of and interest on the Advances and of all other amounts payable by it
under this Agreement are payable without deduction for or on account of any
present or future taxes, duties, withholdings or other charges levied or imposed
by the government of any jurisdiction outside the United States of America or by
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (herein called
"FOREIGN TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold
any Foreign Taxes from any such amount payable by it hereunder or under any of
the Notes to or for the account of any Lender, (i) such amount shall be
increased as may be necessary so that, after making such deductions or
withholdings (including any deductions or withholdings applicable to additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section), such Lender receives an amount equal
to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been
made and (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings and pay
the amount thereof to the relevant government, political subdivision or taxing
authority at or prior to the time required to be paid under applicable law (and
shall promptly furnish to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, official
receipts evidencing such payment). In addition, the Borrower will pay any
present or future stamp or documentary taxes or similar taxes or levies imposed
by any government, political subdivision or taxing authority referred to in the
first sentence of this subsection arising from any payment by it hereunder or
under any of the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any of the Notes (herein called
"OTHER TAXES"). The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for, and
hold each Lender and the Agent harmless against, the full amount of Foreign
Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Foreign Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid or
payable by such Lender or the Agent

                                     - 27 -
<Page>

and any liability of such Lender or the Agent relating thereto (including,
without limitation, penalties, interest and expenses).

     (b)     If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to the
Borrower is increased, or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any
Lender (or its applicable Lending Installation) is reduced, by an amount deemed
by such Lender to be material, which increase or reduction (i) is due to any law
or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or
directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any interpretation
thereof, or the compliance of any Lender therewith, and (ii) would not have
occurred but for the fact that the Borrower (or one or more of its Subsidiaries)
conducts business in a jurisdiction outside the United States of America, the
Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within
15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Agent).

     (c)     If, and to the extent that, any Lender shall actually receive a
credit against its United States federal income tax liability for any Foreign
Taxes or Other Taxes indemnified or paid by the Borrower pursuant to this
Section, such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Borrower thereof and make
reimbursement of such credit to the Borrower, provided that if such Lender
reasonably believes that such credit may be subject to challenge, then such
Lender shall thereupon enter into negotiations in good faith with the Borrower
to determine when reimbursement of such credit can be made to the Borrower.

     (d)     All tax receipts required to be delivered under this Section shall
be originals, duplicate originals or duly certified or authenticated copies
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.905-2(a)(2).

     2.19.   JUDGMENT CURRENCY. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder or under
any of the Notes in the currency expressed to be payable herein or under the
Notes (the "SPECIFIED CURRENCY") into another currency, the parties hereto
agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of
exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking
procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other
currency at the Agent's main Chicago office on the Business Day preceding that
on which final, nonappealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower
in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified
currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following
receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to
be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the
specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified
currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be), in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to
the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so
purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) in the specified currency and (b)

                                     - 28 -
<Page>

any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess
as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under SECTION 11.2, such Lender or
the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

     2.20.   NOTES; TELEPHONIC NOTICES. Each Lender shall, and is hereby
authorized to, record the principal amount of each of its Loans and each
repayment on the schedule attached to its Note (or to otherwise record the same
in its usual practice) provided, however, that the failure to so record shall
not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. The Borrower
hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue U.S.
Dollar Advances (it being understood and agreed that Alternate Currency
Borrowing Requests must be in writing or by facsimile) and to transfer funds
based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any
Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower. The
Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if such
confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice
signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any
material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records
of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

     Upon receipt of its Note, each Lender will: (i) record the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the note dated September 9, 1996 (the "Original Note")
issued under the Original Agreement in its records or, at its option, on the
schedule attached to the Note as the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Note; (ii) mark the Original Note as replaced by the Note; and (iii) promptly
return the Original Note to the Borrower. Thereafter, all references in this
Agreement and any and all instruments or documents provided for herein or
delivered or to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith to the Original
Note shall be deemed references to the Note. The replacement of the Original
Note with the Note shall not be construed to deem paid or forgiven the unpaid
principal amount of, or unpaid accrued interest on, the Original Note
outstanding at the time of replacement.

     2.21.   INTEREST PAYMENT DATES; INTEREST AND FEE BASIS. Interest accrued on
each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which
the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise,
and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal
amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance or
Quoted Rate Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the
date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable
on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the
Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period
longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each
three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest and fees shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest
shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any
payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at
the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance
shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next

                                     - 29 -
<Page>

succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension
of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

     2.22.   NOTIFICATION OF ADVANCES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS AND
COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice,
Borrowing Notice, Alternate Currency Borrowing Request, Continuation/Conversion
Notice and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each
Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon
determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of
each change in the Alternate Reference Rate.

     2.23.   LENDING INSTALLATIONS. Each Lender may book its Loans at any one or
more Lending Installations selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation(s) from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to
any such Lending Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender
for the benefit of such Lending Installation(s). Each Lender may from time to
time, by written or facsimile notice to the Agent and the Borrower, designate a
new Lending Installation through which Loans (or Loans in a particular currency)
will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments (or Loan payments in a
particular currency) are to be made. The Agent may from time to time, by written
or facsimile notice to the Borrower and each Lender, designate a new Lending
Installation at which Advances (or Advances in a particular currency) will be
made available to the Borrower and at which payments on the Advances (or
payments on Advances in a particular currency) are to be made by the Borrower.

     2.24.   NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE AGENT. Unless the Borrower or a Lender,
as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (ii) in the case of payment by the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

     2.25.   WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION. At least five Business Days prior to the
first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of
any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of
the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal
Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such Lender is
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Lender
which so delivers a Form

                                     - 30 -
<Page>

1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent
two additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date
that such form expires (currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001
and one calendar year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence
of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and
such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender
is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an
event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax.

                                   ARTICLE III

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

     3.1.    YIELD PROTECTION. If any law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or
not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the compliance
of any Lender therewith,

             (i)    subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
     to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due from the
     Borrower (excluding federal taxation of the overall net income of any
     Lender or applicable Lending Installation), or changes the basis of
     taxation of payments to any Lender in respect of its Loans or other amounts
     due it hereunder, or

             (ii)   imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
     assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
     against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
     by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves
     and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate
     applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

             (iii)  imposes any other condition the result of which is to
     increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of
     making, funding or maintaining loans or reduce any amount receivable by any
     Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with loans, or
     requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any
     payment calculated by reference to the amount of loans held or interest
     received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,

then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such
Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount
received which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding and
maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.

                                     - 31 -
<Page>

     3.2.    CHANGES IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS. If a Lender determines the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below), then, within 15 days of
demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary
to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans or its obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "CHANGE" means (i)
any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines
(as defined below) or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law,
governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3.    AVAILABILITY OF EURODOLLAR ADVANCES. If (i) any Lender determines
that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, (ii) the Required Lenders determine that deposits of a
type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available or (iii) the Required Lenders determine that the interest rate
applicable to a Eurodollar Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of
making or maintaining such Eurodollar Advance, then the Agent shall suspend the
availability of any new Eurodollar Advances (whether pursuant to SECTION 2.10 or
2.13).

     3.4.    FUNDING INDEMNIFICATION. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance
occurs on a date prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate
Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower in its Borrowing
Notice, Alternate Currency Borrowing Request or Continuation/Conversion Notice,
as the case may be, as a consequence of any condition precedent to such Advance
under SECTION 2.1 or ARTICLE IV not being satisfied or as a consequence of any
failure by the Borrower to borrow such Advance when the same has been made
available to it pursuant to SECTION 2.12, the Borrower will indemnify each
Lender for any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to
fund or maintain the Fixed Rate Advance and, provided that such Lender has taken
such reasonable action, if any, not disadvantageous to it, to mitigate the same,
any other loss or cost incurred by such Lender resulting therefrom.

     3.5.    LENDER STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Fixed Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under SECTIONS 2.18, 3.1 and 3.2 or to

                                     - 32 -
<Page>

avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under SECTION 3.3, so long as
such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under
SECTION 2.18, 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4. Such written statement shall set forth in
reasonable detail (and in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, where
applicable) the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of
manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender
funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, whether in fact that is the
case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the
written statement shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of
the written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under SECTIONS 2.18, 3.1,
3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the obligations and termination of this
Agreement.

     3.6.    REFUND TO BORROWER. If, and to the extent that, any Lender shall
actually receive a credit against its United States federal income tax liability
or otherwise receive any rebate or refund from any government or governmental
agency in respect of any amount paid by the Borrower pursuant to SECTION 3.1 or
3.2, such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Borrower thereof and make
reimbursement of credit, rebate or refund to the Borrower, provided that if such
Lender reasonably believes that such credit, rebate or refund may be subject to
challenge, then such Lender shall thereupon enter into negotiations in good
faith with the Borrower to determine when reimbursement of such credit, rebate
or refund can be made to the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     4.1.    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE RESTATEMENT EFFECTIVE DATE. This
Agreement shall become effective on the date (the "Restatement Effective Date")
on which the Borrower shall have furnished to the Agent, with sufficient copies
for the Lenders:

      (i)    Copies, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
             Borrower, of its Board of Directors' resolutions (and resolutions
             of other bodies, if any are deemed necessary by counsel for any
             Lender) authorizing the execution of the Loan Documents.

     (ii)    An incumbency certificate, executed by the Secretary or Assistant
             Secretary of the Borrower, which shall identify by name and title
             and bear the signature of the officers of the Borrower authorized
             to sign the Loan Documents and to make borrowings hereunder, upon
             which certificate the Lenders shall be entitled to rely until
             informed of any change in writing by the Borrower.

                                     - 33 -
<Page>

    (iii)    A certificate, signed by the chief financial officer of the
             Borrower stating that on the Restatement Effective Date no Default
             or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing.

     (iv)    A written opinion of the Borrower's counsel, addressed to the
             Lenders in substantially the form of EXHIBIT "E" hereto.

      (v)    Note payable to the order of each of the Lenders.

     (vi)    Such other documents as any Lender or its counsel may have
             reasonably requested.

     4.2.    EACH ADVANCE.  The Lenders shall not be required to make any
Advance, unless on the applicable Borrowing Date:

      (i)    There exists no Default or Unmatured Default.

     (ii)    The representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE V are true
             and correct as of such Borrowing Date except for changes in the
             Schedules hereto reflecting transactions permitted by this
             Agreement.

    (iii)    If such Advance is a U.S. Dollar Advance, the Agent shall have
             received a duly completed Borrowing Notice from the Borrower
             pursuant to SECTION 2.10 and, in the case of any Quoted Rate
             Advance, such Borrowing Notice shall have been accepted by the
             Lenders pursuant to SECTION 2.10.

     (iv)    If such Advance is an Alternate Currency Advance, the Agent shall
             have received a duly completed Alternate Currency Borrowing Request
             from the Borrower pursuant to SECTION 2.11, and such Alternate
             Currency Borrowing Request shall have been agreed to in writing by
             each of the Lenders pursuant to SECTION 2.11.

      (v)    All legal matters incident to the making of such Advance shall be
             in accordance with this Agreement in the reasonable judgment of the
             Lenders and their counsel.

     Each Borrowing Notice or Alternate Currency Borrowing Request with respect
to each such Advance shall constitute a representation and warranty by the
Borrower that the conditions contained in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above and have
been satisfied. Any Lender may require a duly completed compliance certificate
in substantially the form of EXHIBIT "G" hereto as a condition to making an
Advance.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

                                     - 34 -
<Page>

     5.1.    CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND STANDING. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its
business is conducted.

     5.2.    AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The Borrower has the corporate power
and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to
perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower
of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have
been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable
against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors, rights generally.

     5.3.    NO CONFLICT; GOVERNMENT CONSENT. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions
therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the Borrower's or any
Subsidiary's articles of incorporation or by-laws or the provisions of any
indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its property, is
bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the property of the Borrower or
a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or
agreement. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization, or validation
of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, any governmental
or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required to
authorize, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of,
any of the Loan Documents.

     5.4.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The May 31, 1997 consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the
Lenders were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly
present the consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations
for the period then ended.

     5.5.    MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since May 31, 1997, there has been no
change in the business, properties, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.6.    TAXES. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be
filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any
assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except for the
filing of such returns and the payment of such taxes, if any, as (a) are

                                     - 35 -
<Page>

being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been
provided or (b) do not in the aggregate exceed $4,000,000 and the failure to
file or pay for which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, the United States income tax returns of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue
Service through the fiscal year ended 1992. No tax liens have been filed other
than those permitted pursuant to SECTION 6.16(a). The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.

     5.7.    LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. Except as set forth in the
Borrower's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its
fiscal year ended May 31, 1997, there is no litigation, arbitration,
governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge
of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Other than any liability incident to such litigation, arbitration or
proceedings, the Borrower has no material contingent obligations not provided
for or disclosed in the Borrower's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for its fiscal year ended May 31, 1997.

     5.8.    SUBSIDIARIES. As of the date hereof, Borrower's Form 10-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its fiscal year ended May 31,
1997 contains an accurate description of all of the Borrower's presently
existing Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulation S-X of the
Securities and Exchange Commission). All of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of all of the Borrower's Subsidiaries have been duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

     5.9.    ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do not
in the aggregate exceed $10,000,000. Neither the Borrower nor any other member
of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur any
withdrawal liability to Multiemployer Plans in an aggregate amount which, when
added to the aggregate Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans, would
exceed of $10,000,000. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of law and regulations and no Reportable Event has
occurred with respect to any Plan. Neither the Borrower nor any other member of
the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so,
and no steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any Plan.

     5.10.   ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or any Lender
in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents
contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact
or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

     5.11.   REGULATION U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes
less than 25% of those assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are
subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder.

                                     - 36 -
<Page>

     5.12.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied in all respects with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations,
orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any
instrumentality or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of their
respective businesses or the ownership of their respective properties, except
where failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received any notice
to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with any of the
requirements of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and
safety statutes and regulations or the subject of any federal or state
investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a
release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, which
non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.13.   INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
thereof is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     5.14.   YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. The Borrower has conducted a comprehensive
review and assessment of its computer applications and is in the process of
making inquiry of its material suppliers, vendors and customers with respect to
the Year 2000 Issue (as such term is defined below). Based on the foregoing
review, the Borrower reasonably believes that the Year 2000 Issue, as it relates
to the Borrower's computer applications, will not result in a Material Adverse
Effect. "Year 2000 Issue" means, with respect to any Person, the ability or
inability of all computer applications material to such Person's business and
operations properly to perform date-sensitive functions for all dates before and
after January 1, 2000. The Borrower is unable to determine the ultimate impact,
if any, on the Borrower's operations resulting from the Year 2000 Issue relating
to material suppliers, vendors and customers.

                                   ARTICLE VI

    (vii)    As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after the

     Person.

     Accounting Principles and that the amount of such financing does not exceed
     $50,000,000 at any one time outstanding (the "Receivables Securitization").

     6.14.   INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. The Borrower will not, nor will it

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

     8.1.    ACCELERATION. If any Default described in SECTION 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent
or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders may terminate
or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, or by written
notice to the Borrower declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both,
whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which the
Borrower hereby expressly waives. The Required Lenders agree to give the
Borrower prompt subsequent notice of any termination or suspension of the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder; PROVIDED, that the giving of
such notice shall not be a condition to the effectiveness of any such
termination or suspension.

     If, within 30 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or
termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder as a
result of any Default (other than any Default as described in SECTION 7.6 or 7.7
with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the payment
of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders
(in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Agent shall, by notice to the
Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.

     8.2.    AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of each Lender affected thereby:

               (i)  Extend the maturity of any Loan or Note or reduce the
                    principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the
                    time of payment of interest or fees thereon.

              (ii)  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
                    Required Lenders.

             (iii)  Extend the Revolving Credit Termination Date, or reduce the
                    amount or extend the payment date for, the mandatory
                    payments required under SECTION 2.3, or increase the amount
                    of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit the
                    Borrower to assign its rights under this Agreement.

              (iv)  Amend this Section 8.2.

                                     - 51 -
<Page>

               (v)  Release any guarantor of any Advance or release all or
                    substantially all of any collateral, if any, supporting the
                    Obligations.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent. The Agent may waive payment
of the fee required under SECTION 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent of any
other party to this Agreement.

     8.3.    PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to SECTION 8.2, and then only

full.

agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
relating to the subject matter thereof.

     9.6.    SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS; BENEFITS OF THIS AGREEMENT. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of
its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any
right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns.

     9.7.    EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent
for any and all reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including

be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review, amendment, modification,
and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse
the Agent and the Lenders for any and all reasonable costs and out-of-pocket
expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent
and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or the Lenders)
paid or incurred by the Agent or any Lender in connection with the collection
and enforcement of the Loan Documents. The Borrower further agrees to indemnify
the Agent and each Lender, its directors, officers and employees against all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation
therefor whether or not the Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) which any of
them may pay or incur arising out of any term or condition contained in this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or the direct or indirect application or
proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder, except to the extent
any of the foregoing arises solely from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the party requesting indemnification. The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

     9.8.    NUMBERS OF DOCUMENTS. All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient
counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation,
enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

the Lenders and the Agent shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither
the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the
Borrower. Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the
Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any
phase of the Borrower's business or operations.

     9.12.   CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT
GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

     9.13.   CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED
STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER,
THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT
OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND

TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER, OR THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT
OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER, IN THE COURTS OF ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION.

other Lenders and Affiliates of any Lender, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants,
and other professional advisors to that Lender who are advised of and agree to

connection with any legal proceeding to which that Lender is a party, and (vi)
permitted by SECTION 12.4; PROVIDED that in the case of each of the preceding
CLAUSES (iv) and (v), such Lender agrees, to the extent reasonably possible and
to the extent that it is legally permitted to do so, to give the Borrower prior
notice of such disclosure and not resist any efforts by the Borrower to obtain
confidential treatment therefor.

     9.15.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR

WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

to take any such action.

upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to

legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel

     10.8.   AGENT'S REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to

of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or
the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms
thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Agent.

     10.9.   RIGHTS AS A LENDER. With respect to its Commitment, Loans made by
it and the Note issued to it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers
hereunder and under any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual
capacity. The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to
those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is
not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

     10.10.  LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                                     - 56 -
<Page>

the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving notice of
resignation, then the retiring Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and
the Lenders, a successor Agent. Such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

     11.1.   SETOFF. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, so long as any Default has occurred and is
continuing, any indebtedness from any Lender to the Borrower (including all
account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations then
due and owing to such Lender.

     11.2.   RATABLE PAYMENTS. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
SECTIONS 2.18, 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than that received by
any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a
portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each
Lender will hold its Percentage of Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection
with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
according to their respective Percentages. In case any such payment is disturbed
by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

     12.1.   SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or

                                     - 57 -
<Page>

obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must
be made in compliance with SECTION 12.3. Notwithstanding CLAUSE (ii) of this
Section, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its
Notes to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment
shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Agent
may treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof
unless and until such payee complies with SECTION 12.3 in the case of an
assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of
the transfer is filed with the Agent. Any assignee or transferee of a Note
agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the
Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any
Note, shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or
assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

     12.2.   PARTICIPATIONS.

             12.2.1. PERMITTED PARTICIPANTS; EFFECT. Any Lender may, in the
     ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
     any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("PARTICIPANTS")
     participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by
     such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such
     Lender under the Loan Documents. Any Lender selling such participating
     interests to a Participant agrees to promptly notify the Borrower of such
     sale and the identity of such Participant. In the event of any such sale by
     a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
     obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender
     shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
     performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the holder of any
     such Note for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by
     the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had
     not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall
     continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
     such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

             12.2.2. VOTING RIGHTS. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
     approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than
     any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
     Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives
     principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable
     with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, postpones any date fixed for
     any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on,
     any such Loan or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or
     releases any substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such
     Loan.

             12.2.3. BENEFIT OF SETOFF. The Borrower agrees that each
     Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in
     SECTION 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
     under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount

                                     - 58 -
<Page>

     of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under
     the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of
     setoff provided in SECTION 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating
     interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each
     Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
     provided in SECTION 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount
     received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to
     be shared in accordance with SECTION 11.2 as if each Participant were a
     Lender.

     12.3.   ASSIGNMENTS.

             12.3.1. PERMITTED ASSIGNMENTS. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
     course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time
     assign to one or more banks or other entities ("PURCHASERS") all or any
     part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such
     assignment shall be substantially in the form of EXHIBIT "H" hereto. Unless
     a Default has occurred and is continuing, the written consent of the
     Borrower and the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
     effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate
     thereof. Such consent shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the
     Agent and shall not be unreasonably withheld.

             12.3.2. EFFECT; EFFECTIVE DATE. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of a
     notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as EXHIBIT "I" to
     EXHIBIT "H" hereto (a "NOTICE OF ASSIGNMENT"), together with any consents
     required by SECTION 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $2,500 fee to the Agent
     for processing such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on
     the effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. On and after the
     effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be
     a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by
     the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under
     the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party
     hereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or
     the Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect
     to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such
     Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant
     to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower
     shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes are issued to
     such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes,
     are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting
     their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

     12.4.   DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "TRANSFEREE") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees in writing for the
benefit of the Borrower to be bound by SECTION 9.14.

                                     - 59 -

     12.5.   TAX TREATMENT. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred
to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause
such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply
with the provisions of SECTION 2.25.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     NOTICES

     13.1.   GIVING NOTICE. Except as otherwise permitted by SECTION 2.20 with
respect to Borrowing Notices and Continuation/Conversion Notices, all notices
and other communications provided to any party hereto under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document shall be in writing or by facsimile and addressed or
delivered to such party at its address set forth below its signature hereto or
at such other address as may be designated by such party in a notice to the
other parties. Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage
prepaid, shall be deemed given when received; any notice, if transmitted by
facsimile, shall be deemed given when transmitted.

     13.2.   CHANGE OF ADDRESS. The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may each
change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the
other parties hereto.

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may
execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. By their execution of
this Agreement, each of the Borrower and the Lenders hereby agree that as of the
Restatement Effective Date the Original Credit Agreement shall be terminated and
of no further force and effect, except for the terms and provisions of the
Original Credit Agreement which expressly survive the termination thereof and
except for the Borrower's obligation to repay all accrued and unpaid fees
thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof. This Agreement shall be
effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
and each party has notified the Agent by telex, facsimile or telephone, that it
has taken such action.

The Lenders who are parties to the
Credit Agreement described below:

Gentlemen/Ladies:

     We are counsel for AAR Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and
have represented the Borrower in connection with its execution and delivery of a
Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among the Borrower, Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association, individually and as Agent, and the
Lenders named therein, providing for Advances in an aggregate principal amount
not exceeding $50,000,000 at any one time outstanding and dated as of May 27,
1998 (the "Agreement"). All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.

     We have examined the Borrower's articles of incorporation, by-laws,
resolutions, the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact and law which we
deem necessary in order to render this opinion. Based upon the foregoing, it is
our opinion that:

     1.      The Borrower and each Subsidiary are corporations duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their
states of incorporation and have all requisite authority to conduct their
business in each jurisdiction in which their business is conducted.

     2.      The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower
and the performance by the Borrower of the Obligations have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Borrower
and will not:

             (a)    require any consent of the Borrower's shareholders;

             (b)    violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
     injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its
     Subsidiaries or the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles of
     incorporation or by-laws or any indenture, instrument or agreement binding
     upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or

             (c)    result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any
     Lien pursuant to the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement
     binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

     3.      The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
enforceable in accordance with their terms except to the extent the enforcement
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,

                                     - 72 -
<Page>

insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if
equitable remedies are sought.

     4.      Except as set forth in the Borrower's Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for its fiscal year ended _______________,
199_, there is no litigation or proceeding against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, could have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     5.      No approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of any
governmental authority, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement or in connection with the payment
by the Borrower of the Obligations.

     This opinion may be relied upon by the Lenders and their participants,
assignees and other transferees. No opinion is expressed herein as to the
relation between the Agent and the Lenders or the relation between the Lenders.

                                                Very truly yours,

Date on the Business Day prior to the proposed Effective Date.

accordance with the provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement as if the
Purchaser were a "Lender" under the Credit Agreement with _____% of the

with respect to all Loans and reimbursement payments made on or after the
Effective Date. In consideration for the transfer to the Purchaser of the
Purchased Percentage of the Loans made by the Assignor which are outstanding on
the Effective Date, (i) with respect to all Floating Rate Loans made by the
Assignor outstanding on the Effective Date, the Purchaser shall pay the
Assignor, on the Effective Date, an amount equal to the Purchased Percentage of

"PAYMENT DATE"), the Purchaser shall pay the Assignor an amount equal to the
Purchased Percentage of such Fixed Rate Loan. On and after the Effective Date,

Assignor to the Purchaser hereunder, the Purchaser shall pay to the Assignor

     the outstanding Advances exceeds the Ratable Amount of the total
     outstanding borrowings and advances under the Parallel Agreements
     (including this Agreement), then the Borrower shall make an immediate
     repayment of the Advances to cause the Advances not to exceed such Ratable
     Amount.

     SECTION 2.7.  AMENDMENT TO SECTION 2.5. Section 2.5 of the Existing Credit

             (a), and the following sentence is added at the end thereof:

             "Any optional reduction in the Aggregate Commitments shall be
             applied against future scheduled reductions in the Aggregate
             Commitment in inverse order of scheduled occurrence."

     (c)     The following new subsections are inserted after such subsection
             (a) reading as follows:

                    (b)   The Aggregate Commitment shall automatically be
             reduced by $5,000,000 on each of June 30, 2002, December 31, 2002,
             and June 30, 2003 (each a "REDUCTION DATE").

                    (c)   No later than the Adjustment Date, the Borrower shall
             have arranged or implemented amendments or other modifications to
             the Parallel Agreements to provide that (i) the aggregate
             outstanding commitments under the Bank One Agreement shall be
             $40,000,000, (ii) the aggregate outstanding commitments under the
             LaSalle Agreement shall be $25,000,000, and (iii) the aggregate
             outstanding commitments under the U.S. Bank Agreement shall be
             $10,000,000. From and after the Adjustment Date, the Aggregate
             Commitment shall not exceed at any time the Ratable Amount of the
             Parallel Agreement Commitments. To the extent that the Borrower
             does not take any necessary steps to reduce the Aggregate
             Commitment in accordance with the requirements of this section,
             then the Aggregate Commitment shall automatically and concurrently,
             without notice or demand, reduce hereunder to an amount equal to
             the Ratable Amount of the Parallel Agreement Commitments.

                    (d)   Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
             for the avoidance of doubt, the Aggregate Commitment shall not
             automatically be reduced due to the reduction in the commitment
             under the Bank One Agreement scheduled to take effect on and after
             December 31, 2003, such scheduled reduction occurring on and after
             December 31, 2003 being in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 in
             the aggregate.

     further action on the part of the parties hereto so that (a) the effective
     interest rates, Applicable Margins, and Facility Fees hereunder are not
     less than the comparable effective interest rates, margins and fees under
     any Parallel Agreement; and (b) the affirmative and negative covenants

     SECTION 2.15. ADDITION OF A NEW SECTION 6.26. Article VI of the Existing
Credit Agreement (Covenants) is further amended by inserting a new Section 6.26,
immediately following new Section 6.25, which reads in its entirety as follows:

             6.26  SYNTHETIC LEASE BORROWINGS AND AGGREGATE COMMITMENT.

             (a)   The Borrower will not and will cause its Subsidiaries and
     Affiliates not to deliver any Notice of Delivery which would cause the
     aggregate of (w) the amounts requested to be funded in such Notice of
     Delivery, (x) the amounts requested to be funded in all other Notices of
     Delivery which have neither been funded nor revoked, (y) all outstanding
     Loans with respect to all Aircraft and Engines, and (z) all outstanding
     Certificate Amounts with respect to all Aircraft and Engines to exceed
     $40,000,000. The Borrower covenants to cause, at all times, the aggregate
     Loans and Certificate Amounts not to exceed $40,000,000.

             (b)   The Borrower covenants and agrees that, on or before February
     28, 2002, it will, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates as
     appropriate to, use commercially reasonable best efforts, to cause the
     implementation and effectiveness of an amendment to the Synthetic Lease
     Documents which (i) effects a reduction in the Maximum Revolving Commitment
     Amount and a pro rata reduction in each Participant's Commitment to cause
     the aggregate of all Participants' Revolving Commitments to be

                                        8

     equal to $40,000,000, and (ii) amends the net worth and fixed charged
     coverage ratios therein to conform to the same ratios in the Amended Credit
     Agreement. The failure of any other party to the Synthetic Lease Documents
     to agree to such amendments for whatever reasons on or before February 28,
     2002 or thereafter, or the failure of such amendments to occur because they
     would effectively cause, a default under the Synthetic Lease Documents, a
     termination of the synthetic lease program, or a Liquidity Purchase
     thereunder, shall not constitute a default under this covenant. In
     addition, the Borrower's covenant and agreement under this paragraph (b) is
     subject to the Agent complying with its agreement under Section 5.3 of the
     Second Amendment. Capitalized terms used in this Section 6.26 and not

     grace period applicable thereto under the respective Parallel Agreement.

       (including the Lenders) exceeds $125 million, the Aggregate Commitment
       will be reduced such that the Borrower's total aggregate committed credit
       facilities from all lenders (including the Lenders) shall not exceed $125
       million.

       (i)  Section 2.6 shall be amended and read as follows:

              2.6. RATABLE LOANS. Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans
       from the several Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their
       respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment. In the event the
       Borrower desires an advance that brings the aggregate principal Dollar
       Amount of all Advances then outstanding in excess of $5 million at any
       time after November 30, 2001, the Advance hereunder related to such
       desired amount shall be in proportion to the ratio that the Aggregate

       Aggregate Commitment) from all lenders providing Borrower an unsecured
       committed credit facility equal to or greater than $20 million (but in
       all cases including the unsecured committed amount provided under the
       Bank of America Agreement, and the LaSalle Agreement), and Borrower shall

       Association, as the same may from time to time be amended, supplemented
       or otherwise modified, and including any replacement unsecured credit
       facility between the Borrower and LaSalle Bank National Association.

                                        3

       (k)  Insert a Section 9.16 to read as follows:

              9.16. MOST FAVORED PRICING/COVENANT PROVISION. The Borrower
       agrees that the Facility Fee, interest rates, and covenants hereunder
       shall be automatically modified to reflect any similar facility fee,
       interest rate or covenant set forth in the Bank of America Agreement, the
       LaSalle Agreement or any other unsecured credit facility entered into
       with another lender, but only to the extent that said fee or interest
       rate is higher or said covenant is more restrictive than as set forth in
       this Agreement.

2.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. In order to induce the Agent and the
     Lenders to enter into this Amendment, AAR hereby represents and warrants to
     the Agent and the Lenders as of the date of this Amendment that:

all of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and the Credit Agreement as amended hereby is agreed to,

                  SECOND AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT

     This SECOND AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT dated as of April 22,
2002 (the "Second Amendment"), is entered into by and between AAR CORP., a
Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a
national banking association (the "Bank").

                                    RECITALS:

     A.   The Borrower and the Bank entered into that certain Revolving Loan
Agreement dated as of April 11, 2001, as modified and amended by that certain
First Amendment to Revolving Loan Agreement dated November 30, 2001
(collectively, the "Loan Agreement").

     B.   At the present time the Borrower requests, and the Bank is agreeable
to amending the Agreement with regard to the sub-facility for issuance of
Letters of Credit, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
Borrower and the Bank hereby agree as follows:

                                   AGREEMENTS:

1.   RECITALS. The foregoing Recitals are hereby made a part of this Second
Amendment.

2.   DEFINITIONS. Capitalized words and phrases used herein without definition
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such words and phrases in the
Loan Agreement.

3.   AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

     3.1. DEFINITIONS. The following new definitions are hereby added to Section
1.1 of the Loan Agreement in their respective alphabetical order:

          "LETTER OF CREDIT" and "LETTERS OF CREDIT" shall mean, respectively, a
     letter of credit and all such letters of credit issued by the Bank, in its
     sole discretion, upon the execution and delivery by the Borrower and the
     acceptance by the Bank of a Master Letter of Credit Agreement and an
     application for Letter of Credit, as set forth in SECTION 2(b) of this
     Agreement.

          "LETTER OF CREDIT MAXIMUM OBLIGATION" shall mean Five Million Dollars
     ($5,000,000).

          "LETTER OF CREDIT OBLIGATIONS" shall mean, at any time, an amount
     equal to the aggregate of the original face amounts of all Letters of
     Credit minus the sum of (i) the amount of any reductions in the original
     face amount of any Letter of

<Page>

     Credit which did not result from a draw thereunder, (ii) the amount of any
     payments made by the Bank with respect to any draws made under a Letter of
     Credit for which the Borrower has reimbursed the Bank, (iii) the amount of
     any payments made by the Bank with respect to any draws made under a Letter
     of Credit which have been converted to a Revolving Loan as set forth in
     SECTION 2.6, and (iv) the portion of any issued but expired Letter of
     Credit which has not been drawn by the beneficiary thereunder. For purposes
     of determining the outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations at any time,
     the Bank's acceptance of a draft drawn on the Bank pursuant to a Letter of
     Credit shall constitute a draw on the applicable Letter of Credit at the
     time of such acceptance.

          "REVOLVING LOAN AVAILABILITY" shall mean at any time the Revolving
     Loan Commitment LESS the Letter of Credit Obligations.

     3.2. LOANS. The definition of "LOANS" and "REVOLVING LOANS" in SECTION 1.1
of the Loan Agreement are hereby deleted in their entirety and the following is
inserted in lieu thereof:

          "LOANS" shall mean, collectively, all Revolving Loans (whether Prime
     Loans or LIBOR Loans) made by the Bank to the Borrower and all Letter of
     Credit Obligations, under and pursuant to this Agreement.

          "REVOLVING LOAN" or "REVOLVING LOANS" shall mean, respectively, each
     direct advance and the aggregate advances or Letters of Credit outstanding
     as set forth in Section 2.1 and 2.6 of this Agreement.

     3.3. LETTERS OF CREDIT. The following new SECTION 2.6 entitled "Letters of
Credit" is hereby added to the Loan Agreement as follows:

          "2.6 LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
     Agreement and upon the execution by the Borrower and the Bank of a Master
     Letter of Credit Agreement and the execution and delivery by the Borrower,
     and the acceptance by the Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, of an
     application for letter of credit, and the payment by the Borrower of the
     Bank's fees charged in connection therewith, the Bank agrees to issue for
     the account of the Borrower out of the Revolving Loan Availability, such
     Letters of Credit in the standard form of the Bank and otherwise in form
     and substance acceptable to the Bank, from time to time during the term of
     this Agreement, provided that the Letter of Credit Obligations may not at
     any time exceed the Letter of Credit Maximum Obligation and provided,
     further, that no Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date later than
     the Revolving Loan Maturity Date. The amount of any payments made by the
     Bank with respect to draws made by a beneficiary under a Letter of Credit
     for which the Borrower has failed to reimburse the Bank upon the earlier of
     (i) the Bank's demand for repayment, or (ii) five (5) days from the date of
     such payment to such beneficiary by the Bank, shall be deemed to have been
     converted to a Revolving Loan as of the date such payment was made by the
     Bank to such beneficiary. Upon the occurrence of an Event of a Default and
     at the option of the

                                        2
<Page>

     Bank, all Letter of Credit Obligations shall be converted to Revolving
     Loans at the Prime Rate, all without demand, presentment, protest or notice
     of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower. In the event
     of a conflict between the Master Letter of Credit Agreement and the Loan
     Agreement, the Loan Agreement shall govern.

          In addition to all other applicable fees, charges and/or interest
     payable by the Borrower pursuant to the Master Letter of Credit Agreement
     or otherwise payable in accordance with the Bank's standard letter of
     credit fee schedule, all standby Letters of Credit issued under and

     Credit has expired or has been returned to the Bank, or (ii) the Bank has
     paid the beneficiary thereunder the full face amount of such Letter of
     Credit. All Letters of Credit other than standby Letters of Credit shall
     bear such fees, costs and interest as charged by the Bank and shall contain
     such other terms as set forth in the Master Letter of Credit Agreement and
     the Bank's standard letter of credit fee schedule."

     3.4. REVOLVING NOTE. SECTION 4 of the Loan Agreement entitled "NOTE
EVIDENCING LOANS" is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following is
inserted in lieu thereof:

          "The Revolving Loans and the Letter of Credit Obligations shall be
     evidenced by a single Revolving Note (together with any and all renewal,
     extension, modification or replacement notes executed by the Borrower and
     delivered to the Bank and given in substitution therefor, the "Revolving
     Note") in the form of EXHIBIT "A" attached hereto, duly executed by the
     Borrower and payable to the order of the Bank. At the time of the initial

     Loan shall be requested hereunder or a repayment made in whole or in part
     thereon, an appropriate notation thereof shall be made on the books and
     records of the Bank. All amounts recorded shall be, absent demonstrable
     error, conclusive and binding evidence of (i) the principal amount of the
     Revolving Loans advanced hereunder and the amount of all Letter of Credit
     Obligations, (ii) any unpaid interest owing on the Revolving Loans, and
     (iii) all amounts repaid on the Revolving Loans or the Letter of Credit
     Obligations. The failure to record any such amount or any error in
     recording such amounts shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the

                                        3

     obligations of the Borrower under the Revolving Note to repay the principal

            (a)  REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and conditions
     of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and in reliance upon the
     representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth herein and in the
     other Loan Documents, the Bank agrees to make such Revolving Loans at such
     times as the Borrower may from time to time request until, but not
     including, the Maturity Date, and in such amounts as the Borrower may from
     time to time request, provided, however, that the aggregate principal
     balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the
     Revolving Loan Commitment. Revolving Loans made by the Bank may be repaid
     and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, borrowed again up to, but
     not including the Maturity Date unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise
     terminated or extended as provided in this Agreement. The Revolving Loans
     shall be used by the Borrower for general corporate needs of the Borrower
     and its Subsidiaries.

            (b)  REVOLVING LOAN INTEREST AND PAYMENTS. Except as otherwise
     provided in this Section 2.1(b), the principal amount of the Revolving
     Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the Interest
     Rate. Accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of all
     Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time which are Prime Rate Loans,
     shall be due and payable monthly, in arrears, commencing on November 1,
     2001 and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, and
     on the Maturity Date. Accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal
     balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time which are
     LIBOR Loans shall be payable on the last Business Day of each Interest
     Period, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof,
     on the date of any principal repayment of a LIBOR Loan and on the Maturity
     Date; provided however, that interest on six month LIBOR borrowings shall
     be payable quarterly. Any amount of principal or interest on the Revolving
     Loans which is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by
     acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest payable on demand at the
     Default Rate.

            (c)  REVOLVING LOAN PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS.

                 (i)   MANDATORY PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENTS. All Revolving Loans
            hereunder shall be repaid by the Borrower on the Maturity Date,
            unless payable sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.
            In the event the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all
            Revolving Loans hereunder at any time exceed the Revolving Loan
            Commitment, the Borrower shall, without notice or demand of any
            kind, immediately make such repayments of the Revolving Loans or
            take such other actions as shall be necessary to eliminate such
            excess.

                 (ii)  OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may from time to time
            prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part, without any
            prepayment penalty whatsoever other than as provided in this
            Agreement.

     2.2    ADDITIONAL LIBOR LOAN PROVISIONS.

            (a)  LIBOR LOAN PREPAYMENTS. Notwithstanding anything to the
     contrary contained herein, the principal balance of any LIBOR Loan may not
     be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. If, for any reason, a LIBOR
     Loan is paid prior to the last Business Day of any Interest Period, the
     Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank against any loss (including any loss
     on redeployment of the funds repaid), cost or expense incurred by the Bank
     as a result of such prepayment.

            (b)  LIBOR UNAVAILABILITY. If the Bank determines in good faith
     (which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error) prior to
     the commencement of any Interest Period that (i) United States dollar
     deposits of sufficient amount and maturity for funding any LIBOR Loan are
     not available to the Bank in the London Interbank Eurodollar market in the
     ordinary course of business, or (ii) by reason of circumstances affecting
     the London Interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not
     exist for ascertaining the rate of interest to be applicable to the
     relevant LIBOR Loan, the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof
     and, so long as the foregoing conditions continue, a Revolving Loan may not
     be advanced as a LIBOR Loan thereafter. In addition, at the Borrower's
     option, each existing LIBOR Loan shall be immediately (i) converted to a
     Prime Rate Loan on the last Business Day of the then existing Interest
     Period, or (ii) due and payable on the last Business Day of the then
     existing Interest Period, without further demand, presentment, protest or
     notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

            (c)  REGULATORY CHANGE. In addition, if, after the date hereof, a
     Regulatory Change shall, in the reasonable determination of the Bank, make
     it unlawful for the Bank to make or maintain the LIBOR Loans, then the Bank
     shall promptly notify the Borrower and Revolving Loans may not be advanced
     as a LIBOR Loan thereafter. In addition, at the Borrower's option, each
     existing LIBOR Loan shall be immediately (i) converted to a Prime Loan on
     the last Business Day of the then existing Interest Period or on such
     earlier date as required by law, or (ii) due and payable on the last
     Business Day of the then existing Interest Period or on such earlier date
     as required by law, all without further demand, presentment, protest or
     notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

            (d)  LIBOR LOAN INDEMNITY. If any Regulatory Change shall (a)
     impose, modify or deem applicable any assessment, reserve, special deposit
     or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the
     account of or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds or disbursements
     by, the Bank; (b) subject the Bank or any LIBOR Loan to any tax, duty,
     charge, stamp tax or fee or change the basis of taxation of payments to the
     Bank of principal or interest due from the Borrower to the Bank hereunder
     (other than a change in the taxation of the overall net income of the
     Bank); or

                                       12
<Page>

     (c) impose on the Bank any other condition regarding such LIBOR Loan or the
     Bank's funding thereof, and the Bank shall reasonably determine (which
     determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error) that the result
     of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Bank of making or
     maintaining such LIBOR Loan or to reduce the amount of principal or
     interest received by the Bank hereunder, then the Borrower shall pay to the
     Bank, within 15 days of demand by the Bank, such additional amounts as the
     Bank shall, from time to time, determine are sufficient to compensate and
     indemnify the Bank for that portion of such increased cost or reduced
     amount attributable to making, funding and maintaining such LIBOR Loan.

     2.3    INTEREST AND FEE COMPUTATION; COLLECTION OF FUNDS. Except as
otherwise set forth herein, all interest and fees shall be calculated on the
basis of a year consisting of 360 days and shall be paid for the actual number
of days elapsed. Principal payments submitted in funds not immediately available
shall continue to bear interest until collected. If any payment to be made by
the Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall become due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
such extension of time shall be included in computing any interest in respect of
such payment.

     2.4    FEES. The Borrower further agrees to pay to the Bank the Facility
Fee for the period from the date hereof to and including the Maturity Date. The
Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in advance on the date hereof and on
each Payment Date thereafter. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section
2.4 shall survive the payment of the Advances and the termination of this
Agreement.

3.   CONDITIONS OF BORROWING.

be required to disburse or make all or any portion of the Loans if any of the

by the Borrower and delivered to the Bank and given in substitution therefor,
the "Revolving Note") dated as of the date hereof in the form of EXHIBIT "A"
attached hereto, duly executed by the Borrower and payable to the order of the
Bank. At the time of the initial disbursement of a Revolving Loan and at each
time an additional Revolving Loan shall be requested hereunder or a repayment
made in whole or in part thereon, an appropriate notation thereof shall be made
on the books and records of the Bank. All amounts recorded shall be, absent

<Page>

binding evidence of (i) the principal amount of the Revolving Loans advanced
hereunder (ii) any unpaid interest owing on the Revolving Loans, and (iii) all
amounts repaid on the Revolving Loans. The failure to record any such amount or
any error in recording such amounts shall not, however, limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the Borrower under the Revolving Note to repay the
principal amount of the Revolving Loans, together with all interest accruing
thereon.

5.   MANNER OF BORROWING.

     Each Revolving Loan shall be made available to the Borrower upon its
written request in the form of EXHIBIT B, from any person whose authority to so
act has not been revoked by the Borrower in writing previously received by the
Bank. Each Revolving Loan may be advanced either as a Prime Loan or a LIBOR
Loan, provided, however, that at any time and from time to time, the Borrower
may identify no more than five (5) Revolving Loans, which may be LIBOR Loans. A
request for a Prime Loan must be received by no later than 12:00 p.m. Chicago,
Illinois time, on the day it is to be funded. A request for a LIBOR Loan must be
(i) received by no later than 12:00 p.m. Chicago, Illinois time, two days before
the day it is to be funded, and (ii) in an amount equal to One Million and
00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) or a higher integral multiple of Five Hundred
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00). If for any reason the Borrower shall
fail to select timely an Interest Period for an existing LIBOR Loan, then such
LIBOR Loan shall be immediately converted to a Prime Loan on the last Business
Day of the then existing Interest Period, all without demand, presentment,
protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
The proceeds of each Prime Loan or LIBOR Loan shall be made available at the
office of the Bank by credit to the account of the Borrower or by other means
requested by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank.

     The Bank is authorized to rely on the telephonic, telecopy (including
facsimile copy) or telegraphic loan requests which the Bank believes in its good
faith judgment to emanate from a properly authorized representative of the
Borrower, whether or not that is in fact the case. The Borrower does hereby
irrevocably confirm, ratify and approve all such forms of loan requests referred
to in the aforementioned sentence and advances by the Bank in reasonable
reliance thereon and does hereby indemnify the Bank against losses and expenses
(including court costs, attorneys' and paralegals' fees) and shall hold the Bank
harmless with respect thereto.

<Page>

Subsidiary of the Borrower is duly organized, existing and in good standing
under the laws of the state wherein such Subsidiary was organized or formed,

authority to enter into this Agreement, to make the borrowings and execute and
deliver the Loan Documents as provided herein and to perform all of its duties

forth, violate or contravene any provision of law to which the Borrower is
subject. All necessary and appropriate action has been taken on the part of the
Borrower to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Loan
Documents. This Agreement and the Loan Documents are valid and binding
agreements and contracts of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in
accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited

creditors rights generally.

     7.3    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The nature and transaction of the business and
operations of the Borrower, and the use of its properties and assets, including,
but not limited to, any real estate owned or occupied by the Borrower or its

conflict with any applicable law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or order
of any kind or nature binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act or
any zoning, land use, building, noise abatement, occupational health and safety
or other laws, including Environmental Laws, any building permit or any
condition, grant, easement, covenant, condition or restriction, whether recorded
or not binding on the Borrower or any or its Subsidiaries except where the
failure to comply would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     7.4    ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. Neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that its operations are
not in material compliance with any applicable Environmental Laws or the subject
of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is
needed to respond to a release of Hazardous Materials into the environment which
non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     7.5    ABSENCE OF BREACH. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Loan Documents and any other documents or instruments to be
executed and delivered by the Borrower in connection with the Loans shall not:

     further transfer of said securities, or any portion thereof, as to whether
     the Bank or such nominee has the right to make such further transfer, and
     shall not be liable for transferring the same;

            (d)  make an election with respect to the Accounts or any other from
     time to time collateral for any of the Obligations under Section 1111 of
     the Code or take action under Section 364 or any other section of the Code;

                                       30

          the net cash proceeds received by the Borrower from the sale
          of any of its capital stock on or after May 31, 2000 plus
          (c) an amount equal to the aggregate of one-third of
          Consolidated Net Income earned during each of its fiscal
          years beginning with its fiscal year commencing June 1,
          2000, said fiscal years to be taken as one accounting period
          minus (d) amounts (not to exceed $30,000,000 in the
          aggregate for the purposes of this covenant) either used for
          the purchase or retirement of the Borrower's capital stock

          associated costs on or after May 31, 2000."

2.   The definition of "Interest Rate" shall be amended and read as follows:

                 times. The LIBOR Rate shall be fixed for each Interest Period;
                 or
          (ii)   the Prime Rate plus zero % at all times when the Borrower has
                 an Investment Grade Rating and 0.50% at all times when the
                 Borrower does not have an Investment Grade Rating.
                 Provided, however, that in no event shall the Interest Rate be
                 less than the highest rate charged at any time by the
                 Borrower's Unsecured Lenders.

     WHEREAS, the Company amended and restated the AAR CORP. Supplemental Key

     4.   The last paragraph of Section 3.1 of the Plan is hereby amended to
read as follows:

     For purposes of determining the Supplemental Retirement Benefit described
     above:

          (i)   The amount described in (a) above for any Participant who

          (ii)  A Participant's Final Average Earnings described in (a) above
     shall be determined as of October 1, 2001, and shall be adjusted by an
     amount equal to 25% of the percentage increase in the Participant's base

     salary in effect on the date of the Participant's termination of employment
     for any reason, including Retirement, Disability or death.

          (iv)  The amounts described in (a) and (b) shall be computed in the

          (i)   For calculating the Qualified Retirement Benefit under Section
     3.2(a) only, any Key Employee Participant who was over the age of 55 on
     January 1, 2000 shall be deemed a "Grandfathered Participant" as defined
     under the Qualified Retirement Plan.

          (ii)  A Participant's Final Average Earnings shall be determined as of

     by a Participant after such date.

          (iii) In determining a Participant's Qualified Retirement Benefit, the
     Participant's Cash Account Balance shall not be credited with Pay Credits
     for any period of time on or after October 1, 2001, and in the case of a
     Participant who is a Grandfathered Participant, the Grandfathered Benefit
     shall be calculated considering the Participant's Final Average Earnings,
     Credited Service (not in excess of 20 years) and Social Security offset as
     of October 1, 2001.

          (iv)  The amounts described in (a) and (b) shall be computed in the

     7.   The second sentence of Section 7.2 of the Plan is hereby amended to
delete the reference to "Sections 3.4 through 3.8" and insert "Sections 3.4 and
3.5" in lieu thereof.

     8.   Article VII of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new Section 7.4
thereto to read as follows:

          7.4   TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION. The Company, in its sole

     Account, as applicable to such Participant, determined as of the date of
     termination of participation, shall be made to such Participant, his
     Surviving Spouse or beneficiaries either (i) in the manner and at the time
     described in Articles III and IV of the Plan; or (ii) in the sole
     discretion of the Company in a lump sum payment as soon as practicable
     following such termination of participation. No additional Supplemental
     Retirement Benefit or Surviving Spouse Benefit shall be earned by such
     Participant after termination of his participation in the Plan with respect
     to such benefits, and no additional credits of Supplemental Salary Deferral
     Contributions, Supplemental Company Contributions or Supplemental Profit
     Sharing Contributions shall be made to the Accounts of such Participant
     after termination of his participation in the Plan with respect to such
     benefits, but the Company shall continue to credit earnings, gains and
     losses to existing Accounts of such Participant pursuant to Section 4.5
     until the balances of such Accounts have been fully distributed to the
     Participant or his beneficiaries.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment No. 2 has been executed on this 10th day
of October, 2001.
