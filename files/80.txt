ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a)      General Development of Business and Recent Events

         1.     Introduction.

                AM International, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware.  As used
herein, "Registrant" or the "Company" means AM International, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, unless the context indicates the contrary.

                Registrant currently conducts its business through one business
segment, AM Multigraphics, which serves the graphics arts industry in the United
States. In September, 1996, Registrant sold its interest in AM Japan Co., Ltd.
On October 17, 1996, Registrant's Canadian subsidiary initiated bankruptcy
proceedings.  Both of these subsidiaries were included as part of AM
Multigraphics for financial reporting purposes. In the last eighteen months, as
previously reported, Registrant has divested its Sheridan Systems and AM
Multigraphics - International business segments.

                On August 27, 1996, Registrant sold substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of the Sheridan Systems division, a leading supplier of
systems and components to both the printing and newspaper publishing
industries, to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. The sale included substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of Registrant's AM Graphics International
Limited subsidiary in Slough, England.

                The disposition of the AM Multigraphics - International
operations has taken place in stages, as Registrant has divested its
unprofitable foreign subsidiaries. In February, 1996, Registrant's AM
International UK Limited subsidiary in England entered into an Adminstration
proceeding, which resulted in the sale of certain portions of that business.  In
March, 1996, Registrant sold its Netherlands holding company, including all its
subsidiaries in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, to a local management
buyout team.

                All financial information has been restated to reflect the
Sheridan Systems and the AM Multigraphics - International operations as
discontinued operations.  AM Multigraphics is a distributor of an extensive
range of equipment, supplies and services to the graphics arts industry, having
recently undertaken the final steps to exit the manufacture of equipment. The
majority of Registrant's equipment, systems and supplies are sold under the AM
Multigraphics(R) brand name.  To complement and expand its product lines,
Registrant purchases additional products from outside suppliers, which are sold
either under Registrant's or the producing company's trade names.

                On October 29, 1996 the Company entered into a definitive Merger
Purchase Agreement with a corporation newly formed by affiliates of Pacholder
Associates, Inc., a Cincinnati-based provider of investment management,
financial advisory and investment banking services to institutional clients.
This agreement provides for the merger of a subsidiary of purchaser with and
into the Company pursuant to which the current shareholders of the Company will
receive $5.00 per common share and the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the purchaser. The transaction is conditioned upon the purchaser
finalizing a credit facility within 30 days as well as a number of additional
conditions, including approval by a majority of the shareholders of the 
Company at a meeting tentatively scheduled for January, 1997.

         2.     Bankruptcy Proceedings.

                On May 17, 1993, Registrant and its subsidiary,
Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation ("AMC"), filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in The United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") case
numbers 93-582 through 93-583 (the "Bankruptcy Proceedings").  Registrant also
filed on that date a proposed Plan of Reorganization.  The Chapter 11 filing
related to Registrant's domestic operations and did not include its foreign
subsidiaries.

<PAGE>   4

                On August 26, 1993, a hearing was held by the Bankruptcy Court
to consider approval of a Disclosure Statement to be distributed to creditors
and shareholders of Registrant.  After that hearing, and by Order of the
Bankruptcy Court dated August 26, 1993, the Second Amended Disclosure Statement
(hereinafter the "Disclosure Statement") was approved as containing "adequate
information" for creditors and shareholders of Registrant in accordance with
Section 1125(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Further information on the First
Amended Plan of Reorganization as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto (as so
amended the "Plan") and the disclosures made in connection therewith, is
available in the Disclosure Statement and the Plan incorporated
herein by reference to Exhibits 28 and 10(A), respectively, to the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1993, File No.
1-683.

                On September 29, 1993, Registrant's Plan was confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court.  In general, the Plan provided for distribution of
approximately 7,000,000 shares of new Common Stock ("Common Stock"), of which   
approximately  97% was distributed to former holders of Registrant's 12% Senior
Subordinated Debentures, 2% to former holders of Registrant's $2.00 Convertible
Exchangeable Preferred Stock ("Old Preferred Stock") and 1% to former holders
of Registrant's Common Stock ("Old Common Stock").  The Plan also provided for
distribution of 1,095,000 Warrants to Purchase Common Stock ("Warrants") to
former holders of Old Preferred Stock.  The Warrants permitted the holder to
purchase an aggregate of 1,095,000 shares of Common Stock until October 15,
1996 at an exercise price of $18.00 per share, but have now expired and are of
no further effect.  Under the Plan, general unsecured creditors are to be paid
in full over a period of five years with interest at 5% per annum unless they
elected to be paid in full under the convenience class (claims under $2,000) or
unless they elected before September 29, 1993 to receive Common Stock in lieu
of cash.

                The Plan became effective on October 13, 1993 (the "Effective
Date").  Distributions provided for in the Plan, including Common Stock and
Warrants, commenced on that date.  On the Effective Date, all Old Preferred
Stock, Old Common Stock, Old Warrants to Purchase Common Stock and Old
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights attached to the Old Common Stock were canceled
and became of no further force and effect except as evidence of the holder's
entitlement to a distribution under the Plan.  All exchange rights associated
with the Old Preferred Stock and Old Common Stock expired on October 13, 1995.
For information relating to shares of Common Stock outstanding and shares of
Common Stock held for exchange as described above, see Notes 4 and 14 of the
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained in Item 8 hereof.  Also
on the Effective Date the former directors of Registrant were replaced.

         3.     Events Leading to Bankruptcy Proceedings.

                Reference is made to Section D of Part III of the Disclosure
Statement (pages 22 to 29), incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 28 to
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31,
1993, File No. 1-683, for information on the general development of the
business of Registrant and events which led to commencement of the Bankruptcy
Proceedings on May 17, 1993.

         4.     Corporate Structure of Registrant

                Registrant, AM International, Inc., was originally incorporated
in Delaware in 1924 as Addressograph Securities Corporation.  Registrant has
had several name changes, one of which was Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation
for the period May 6, 1931 to January 2, 1979.  Registrant's subsidiary,
Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation ("AMC") was originally incorporated in
Delaware in 

                                       2
<PAGE>   5

August 1972 as AM International, Inc. and changed its name to
Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation on January 2, 1979.  Until October 13,
1993, AMC was a wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant and was a holding company
for certain foreign subsidiaries.  Pursuant to the Plan, AMC was merged with
and into Registrant on October 13, 1993.


(b)      Financial Information About Industry Segments

                See the information in the section entitled "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
in Note 12 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" under the
section entitled "Geographic Segments" contained in Items 7 and 8 of this
Report, respectively.
 
 (c)     Narrative Description of Business

                Registrant currently conducts its business through its one
remaining business segment:  AM Multigraphics, which currently has
approximately 800 employees.  AM Multigraphics is a distributor of equipment,
supplies and services to the graphic arts industry, and is currently exiting
the engineering and manufacturing of offset duplicating equipment and supplies
to focus  exclusively on distribution of equipment, supplies and service.  In
1996, the Registrant divested its Sheridan Systems and AM
Multigraphics - International operations in previously reported transactions.

         AM Multigraphics is headquartered in Mount Prospect, Illinois, where,
historically, it has manufactured and distributed a broad product line of
equipment and supplies and provided services for the graphics arts industry
through its own direct sales and service organizations in the United States.
AM Multigraphics products traditionally have included small offset printing
equipment, automated copy/duplicating systems, digital color printing systems,
pre and post press products and supplies.

                Presently, AM Multigraphics is completing its plans to exit the
engineering and manufacturing of offset duplicating equipment to focus entirely
on distribution of supplies, services and equipment to the graphics arts
industry.  The declining market for the segment's traditional offset duplicator
products, due to inroads by alternative technologies, resulted in the
re-evaluation of its traditional strategy and the decision to exit
manufacturing and focus upon the distribution of supplies, services and
equipment.  Accordingly, the Registrant today is focused on (1) supplies and 
prepress products, and (2) service and parts.  

         The supplies and prepress category consists of consumable products
used in the production of printed materials, such as films, inks, plates,
rubber rollers, cleaning solutions and cotton pads, as well as pre-press
products such as platemakers and image-setters.  The Registrant tracks various
categories of these products, none of which accounts for more than 10% of its
revenues.  Similarly, no single supplier accounts for more than 10% of
Registrant's revenues.

         The service and parts category provides service for the traditional
installed base of offset duplicators and associated prepress products and
simple bindery equipment.  The Company has 400 service representatives.

         The following table sets forth the breakdown of revenues among
machines, supplies and services in the United States, Canada and Japan for
fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994.

         AM Multigraphics also manages a network of approximately 74
independent dealers and sales representatives selling in approximately 95 other
countries.

                The principal customers of AM Multigraphics include in-plant
print shops, franchised and independent quick print shops, small commercial
printers and governmental and educational institutions.  AM Multigraphics has
in excess of 50,000 customers.  No customer accounts for more than 10% of
Registrant's revenues.

         5.  Competition and Competitive Conditions

                The Company operates in a highly competitive market in which
price, delivery and customer service are key factors.  The Registrant's
customers are in-plant, quick print and small commercial printer market
segments.  The market for small offset duplicator presses, the traditional
proprietary equipment of the division, is mature and continues to face
competition from alternative technologies.  Because the installed base of
equipment has historically provided the primary market for many of Registrant's
services and supplies, the Company is increasingly reliant on its general
distribution capabilities in continuing to serve its market segments.  Gross
margins are expected to decrease as the Company seeks to add product lines
through distribution agreements, joint ventures and affiliations with third
parties.  To offset the lower margins the Company has invested in information
systems and has undertaken other reorganization measures to increase efficiency
and lower expenses.

         The competitive market is also one of heavy regional competition, but
consolidation of dealers is occurring, which brings consolidated buying power
and distribution cost efficiencies.  The Registrant's investments in
information systems and other reorganization measures are designed to enable it 
to expand its business opportunities with existing customers and possibly to
add volume through acquisitions over time.

         6.     Cyclical Nature of Business and Liquidity

                The revenues of Registrant are dependent upon trends in the
printing industry, which are a function of (among other factors) overall
economic factors and advertising expenditures.  The backlog for the AM
Multigraphics segments is less than 5% of annual revenues and is not a material
factor in the conduct of the business.  Registrant believes that substantially
all of this backlog will be shipped during the 1997 fiscal year.

                Certain customers of  AM Multigraphics require long-term
financing for purchases of equipment distributed by the Company.  Registrant
cooperates with various independent finance and leasing companies to provide
such financing.  These agreements are sometimes on a partial recourse basis
with remarketing arrangements on a non-discretionary, non-priority basis.  From
time to time, Registrant's operations enter into long-term leases with their
customers.  Registrant periodically sells identified pools of lease receivables
and pools of rental equipment to financial institutions on a limited recourse
basis. The existence of such financing is not, however, significant to
Registrant's domestic or international operations each taken as a whole.

                Approximately $0.4 million was expended by Registrant for
research and development in fiscal 1996, $0.7 million in 1995, and $0.6
million in 1994.   Registrant's research, development and engineering
expenditures are made primarily to maintain competitive product offerings.

                Registrant owns or is licensed under various patents and
trademarks.  While such rights are important, Registrant does not believe that
its business as a whole is materially dependent on any one patent or trademark
or group of patents or trademarks.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

                Registrant's principal executive offices are located in Mt.
Prospect, Illinois.  Registrant moved its corporate headquarters from Rosemont,
Illinois to its current headquarters in September, 1996, following the
disposition of Registrant s Sheridan Systems division.  Registrant moved to
Rosemont in April, 1995 and previously had been located at the AM Multigraphics
facility in Mt. Prospect, Illinois since March 22, 1993 when it moved from its
downtown Chicago location.

                In 1996, Registrant undertook the relocation of its AM
Multigraphics operations from its 700,000 square foot manufacturing and office
facility in Mt. Prospect to newer, more cost efficient facilities.  The project
consisted of three parts:  (1) relocation of the business offices to a 64,400
square foot facility in Mt. Prospect; (2) relocation of the distribution center
to an 80,000 square foot nearby complex in Arlington Heights, Illinois, to
enhance the unit's distribution capabilities; and, (3) the sale of  its former
Mount Prospect, Illinois facility for approximately $6.8 million in 1996.

                Registrant owns or leases distribution, sales and service
facilities throughout the United States.  In the United States, Registrant
occupies 30 leased facilities with total square footage of 455,000.  Leases for
approximately 185,000 square feet will expire in April and May of 1997, and
will not be renewed.

                The facilities occupied by Registrant as of October 28, 1996,
which have more than 20,000 square feet of space or which are otherwise
material to Registrant's businesses, are set forth below.  Although certain
facilities remain underused, Registrant believes that the properties and
equipment included therein are well maintained, in good operating condition and
adequate for the current needs of its operations.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

                 Reference is made to Item 1, Section (a) Paragraph 2, for
information on Registrant's Bankruptcy Proceedings.  The commencement of the
Bankruptcy Proceedings resulted in an automatic stay of certain litigation
against Registrant pursuant to Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code as of May 17,
1993.  Therefore, with certain exceptions, all legal proceedings against
Registrant pending as of May 17, 1993, will be resolved through the bankruptcy
process.  In addition, there are significant claims pending in the Bankruptcy
Proceeding.  Registrant believes the resolution of these legal proceedings and
claims will not have a material adverse effect on the business or the financial
position of Registrant.

                 Registrant has been notified of various environmental matters
in connection with certain current or former locations in  Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  Registrant believes that the legal
liability relating to such matters, if any, will either be resolved
consensually between Registrant and relevant governmental authorities or will
be subject to resolution through the bankruptcy process as with other disputed
claims.  Registrant believes the resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the business or the financial position of
Registrant.

                 Registrant is involved in various other administrative and
legal proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability and
general liability lawsuits against which Registrant is partially insured.  The
resolution of these other proceedings is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business or the financial position of Registrant.

ANALYSIS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

         Over the past several years, the Company has formulated and executed
various restructuring plans in order to improve operating results.  These plans
have included the exit from certain unprofitable foreign subsidiaries, the
divestitures of non-core product lines, the exit from manufacturing operations
at AM Multigraphics and the implementation of strategic investments in new
products and capabilities.  In July 1996 the Company entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement with Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG for the sale of its
Sheridan Systems segment.  The sale of Sheridan Systems was concluded in August
1996.  In addition, during 1996 the Company disposed of its AM
Multigraphics-International Operations.  These segments are reflected as
discontinued operations.  Included in Continuing Operations are results of the
two remaining foreign subsidiaries; however, the Company sold its interest in
AM Japan Co., Ltd. in September, 1996, and on October 17, 1996, AM Canada filed
a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy.

OPERATING RESULTS

         The Continuing Operations are comprised of one business segment, the
AM Multigraphics segment.  The AM Multigraphics segment serves the graphics
arts industries in North America, and until September 1996 Japan, by 
distributing an extensive range of sheet fed offset duplicating presses, 
digital color printing equipment, pre and post press equipment, and a wide 
range of supplies and technical 


                                       11
<PAGE>   14

services. In 1995 the operation initiated efforts to transition out of 
engineering and manufacturing to focus primarily on distribution, sales and 
service activities.

         In response to declining demand for manufactured duplicator products
and services, AM Multigraphics developed a strategic plan during 1995 to
transition from being a manufacturing based supplier to becoming a broad based
distributor of equipment, supplies and services to the graphics arts markets.
Efficiency in providing a broad line of products and services to its large
customer base and differentiation through the provision of technical service
and support are the tactical objectives of the strategy.  The Company has
efforts underway to phase out its manufacturing operations, expand its product
offering through new distribution agreements and transition its organization
structure and capabilities to function as an efficient distribution business.
While progress has been made in adding new products, updating and enhancing
systems and restructuring the organization, significant efforts to complete the
transition from a manufacturing based supplier to a distribution business still
need to be completed.  In addition, with the divestiture of Sheridan Systems,
it will be necessary for the Company to restructure its corporate staff and
eliminate excess facilities and equipment.

         During September of fiscal year 1994, the Company emerged from Chapter
11 Bankruptcy.  The Company had operated under the protection of Chapter 11
following a voluntary petition for reorganization filed in May 1993.  With the
emergence from Chapter 11 in 1994, the Company adopted Fresh Start Reporting,
which resulted in material changes to the balance sheet, including valuation
changes of assets and liabilities at fair market value and valuation of equity
based on the appraised reorganization value of the business.

          Revenues in 1996 declined $23.4 million, or 12% from the prior year
period. In 1995 revenues increased slightly after a decline of 3% in 1994 from
1993. The decline in revenues, which has been consistent with longer term
trends, has occurred principally in the sheet fed offset duplicator products
which include press and post-press machines, supplies and maintenance services.
The duplicator machines and supplies are products which have been largely
manufactured by the Company. Market demand for the Company's duplicator
products has declined due to inroads from competing printing
technologies. As a result of these competitive inroads, the installed base of
duplicator equipment has experienced long term decline which has led to
decreased sales of equipment, supplies and services. In addition, the Company
experienced significant liquidity problems during 1996 which led to a reduction
in inventory levels, among other things. The lower inventory level negatively
affected the Company's ability to serve its supply and service customers which
resulted in lower revenues and gross margin. The subsidiaries in Japan and
Canada, which the Company has divested, contributed revenues of $40.0 million
in 1996, $44.3 million in 1995 and $42.1 in 1994.

         Non Operating Expenses consisted primarily of interest expense in
1996, 1995 and 1994.  The interest expense related primarily to borrowings
under the Domestic Revolving Credit Agreement, which have been required to fund
operations, and interest on general unsecured claims and priority tax claims
from the Company's reorganization.  In 1994 the Company recorded reorganization
income of $23.9 million which pertained to the adoption of Fresh Start
Reporting, as previously described.  The income resulted from fair market
adjustments to tangible 


                                       12
<PAGE>   15

assets and liabilities of $8.0 million, a provision of $10.1 million to accrue
for professional fees related to the reorganization, and to record the
Reorganization Value in Excess of Fair Market Value of $26.0 million.

         The net loss of $20.2 million from Continuing Operations in 1996
worsened by $16.0 million as compared with 1995.  The increased loss was
primarily due to volume driven margin erosion in 1996, declines in gross margin
rates resultant from shifts in product mix to lower margin distributed
products, and restructuring charges.  The restructuring charges of $7.0 million
in 1996 related to the shutdown of manufacturing operations, the closure of
corporate offices and the exit costs for the Canadian subsidiary.  Continuing
Operations had a net loss of $4.2 million in 1995 compared with a net income of
$23.9 million in 1994.  With the emergence from Chapter 11 in 1994, the Company
adopted Fresh Start Reporting, which resulted in material changes to the
balance sheet, including valuation changes of assets and liabilities at fair
market value and valuation of equity based on the appraised reorganization
value of the business.  The reorganization and adoption of Fresh Start
Reporting in 1994 resulted in a one time reorganization income of $23.9
million.

  The decrease in net income for the year ended July 31, 1995 as compared with
fiscal year 1994 was again primarily due to lower gross margins related to the
change in product mix to lower margin distributed products.  In addition, in
1994 the Company recorded a favorable adjustment of $23.9 million which
resulted from the adoption of Fresh Start Reporting in 1994, as previously
described.

OPERATING RESULTS

         The Discontinued Operations is comprised of two business segments, the
Sheridan Systems segment and the divested AM Multigraphics - International
segment.  The Sheridan Systems business serves the printing and newspaper
publishing industries by providing bindery systems and newspaper mailroom
systems.  The products sold by Sheridan Systems were largely capital equipment
items and market demand has historically been cyclical.  The divested AM
Multigraphics - International segment served certain foreign graphics arts
markets through wholly owned subsidiaries, situated primarily in Europe.  The
divested AM Multigraphics - International subsidiaries distributed an extensive
range of sheet-fed offset duplicating presses, digital color printing
equipment, pre and post press equipment and a wide range of  supplies and
technical services.

          The net loss from Discontinued Operations was $25.3 million in 1996
compared to net income of $8.8 million in 1995, and a net loss of $23.2 million
in 1994.  The increased loss in 1996 over 1995 resulted primarily from
deteriorating market conditions for the Sheridan Systems segment in 1996, and a
$15.2 million loss recorded on the sale of the segment.  During September of
fiscal year 1994, the Company emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. The Company
had operated under the protection of Chapter 11 following a voluntary petition
for reorganization filed in May 1993.  With the emergence from Chapter 11 in
1994, the Company adopted Fresh Start Reporting, which resulted in material
changes to the balance sheet, including valuation changes of assets and
liabilities at fair market value and valuation of equity based on the appraised
reorganization value of the business.  The reorganization and adoption of Fresh
Start Reporting in 1994 resulted in a one time reorganization expense of $27.0
million.

         The operating results of Sheridan Systems significantly varied from
period to period primarily due to the cyclical nature of the business which
dramatically affected revenue levels and gross margins. Orders for Sheridan
Systems bindery and newspaper mailroom products have been in the millions of
dollars and therefore revenues, margins and customer backlogs varied
significantly depending on the timing of customer orders.  In 1996 Sheridan
Systems revenues declined $72.9 million from the prior year . Weak market
demand and a low beginning backlog were the principal reasons for the decrease
in revenues.  The weak market demand was attributable to a combination of
factors which include a reduction in printed product for magazines, catalogs
and direct mail and the existence of excess capacity in the printing industry.
Historically, the health of the retail sector of the U.S. economy which
directly impacts advertising expenditures impacts market demand.  Sheridan
Systems incurred an operating loss of $2.6 million in 1996, compared to income
of $17.8 million in the prior year period due principally to the lower volume.
Fiscal year 1995 revenues increased 15% over 1994 largely due to higher orders
particularly for bindery equipment, and a reduction in backlog.  In 1995
Sheridan Systems recognized approximately 

                                       14
<PAGE>   17

$20.0 million in revenues from prototype equipment which had been shipped 
in 1994 and accepted by customers in 1995. The operating income in 1995 of 
$17.8 million improved by $3.4 million over 1994 due to the increased revenue 
level and related gross margin increase. The 1994 operating results reflected 
revenues of $158.1 million which was only slightly improved over 1993.

         The results of the divested AM Multigraphics - International segment
consistently reflected operating losses and declining revenues.  The revenue
decreases, throughout the periods, were attributable to declining market demand
for offset duplicating presses and the related erosion of the installed base of
duplicating equipment.  The decline in market demand has been the result of
inroads made by competing printing technologies.  The users of duplicators have
been the principal customers for the related supplies and services. The
divested AM Multigraphics - International operations were also adversely
impacted by decreases in sales and margins of electronic pre-press products due
to competitive pressures in all periods.  The Company undertook numerous
restructuring initiatives in response to the declining revenues and 
operating losses, with significant headcount reductions accomplished and
overall cost reductions implemented over the reporting periods.  The
restructurings were costly due to local statutory requirements and required
labor negotiations which slowed the implementation of cost reduction actions.
Despite these restructuring efforts and cash expenditures the Company was not
able to eliminate the operating losses which ultimately led to the divestiture
of these operations.

         In 1996 the Company had unusual item expense of $15.2 million which
resulted from the sales of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of
the Sheridan Systems division.  In 1995 the Company had unusual item income of
$4.8 million.  This income resulted from divestitures of non-core product lines
in the Discontinued Operations.  The divestitures included the sale of certain
assets related to the service of forms and sheetfed presses, the service and
supply business formerly known as Advanced Imaging Products, and the U.K.
copier business.

         Non Operating expenses include interest expense, primarily on
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and goodwill amortization
expense.  In 1994 the Company recorded reorganization expense of $27.0 million
which pertained to the adoption of Fresh Start Reporting, as previously
described.  The expense resulted from fair market adjustments to tangible
assets and liabilities of $9.7 million, a write off of existing Goodwill of
$39.8 million and to record the Reorganization Value on Excess of Fair Market
Value of $22.5 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


         The Company's total cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 million as of
July 31, 1996 as compared with $12.6 million on July 31, 1995. In addition to
the reduction in cash balances, net short term borrowings increased $8.2
million from prior year levels.

         During 1996, the primary sources of cash from operating activities
were a reduction in inventories of $13.1 million, and an accounts receivable
reduction of $6.3 million. The inventory reduction in the current period was
primarily the result of the phase out of machine manufacturing

activities and a related reduction in parts and finished goods inventories.
The reduction in accounts receivable was the result of the collection of
comparatively higher outstanding balances which existed at July 31, 1995 due to
a higher revenue level in the period. Throughout the reporting periods, 
collection rates have remained relatively consistent while increases and 
decreases in the overall accounts receivable balance were due principally to 
changes in revenue levels.

         The primary use of cash in 1996 was the net loss of $45.5 million.
The net loss included a loss of $25.3 million from discontinued operations.
This loss in discontinued operations was offset by a reduction in assets of
discontinued operations prior to their divestiture of $26.3 million.  The
reduction in the discontinued operations assets was primarily the collection of
accounts receivable and other long term assets, primarily lease receivables.

         Capital expenditures of $9.0 million in 1996 were primarily to upgrade
systems and equipment and to provide for leasehold improvements. The Company
received $6.8 million in proceeds for the sale of its AM Multigraphics
headquarters, manufacturing and distribution facility in Mt. Prospect,
Illinois.  The Company has committed to capital expenditures related to certain
increased systems capabilities. These expenditures will be financed utilizing a
combination of cash balances, funds obtained under the revolving credit
facility, and third party lease arrangements.

         The Company's principal credit facility as of July 1996 was its $25.0
million revolving credit facility, which expired in October 1996.  The
utilizations under this facility were limited by a borrowing base which as of
July 31, 1996, was approximately $18.4 million.  The $8.2 million increase in
short-term borrowings for the year ended July 31, 1996, was required to
principally fund the net loss, required payments to holders of general unsecured
claims, and priority tax claims under the Company's Plan of Reorganization and 
lease obligations.

         In August 1996 the Company completed the sale of its Sheridan Systems
segment for proceeds of $50.1 million.  In September the Company collected
approximately $11.0 million from the sale of its interest in AM Japan Co., Ltd. 
The increase in cash balances from these transactions provides the Company with
adequate financial resources for the foreseeable future.  At September 28,
1996, the Company had a cash balance of $41.2 million after repaying bank debt
and meeting other short-term obligations.  The Company is currently seeking to
obtain new banking facilities to provide for the issuance of letters of credit,
fund selected customer financing programs, and increase liquidity to the
Company.

PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

          On September 29, 1993 the Company's Reorganization Plan (the Plan) was
confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court, with the Plan being consummated
on October 13, 1993.  As a result of the reorganization and the recording of the
restructuring transaction and implementation of Fresh Start Reporting, the
Company's results of operations for the year ending July 31, 1996 are not
comparable to the two preceding years.  See Note 14 of "Notes to
                                          
                                       16

Consolidated Financial Statements" for information on consummation of 
the Plan and implementation of Fresh Start Reporting.

         The most significant adjustments which resulted from recording the
restructuring transaction and the implementation of Fresh Start Reporting
affected the Company's Statement of Operations.  These adjustments related to
decreased interest expense, decreased amortization of intangibles and increased
income tax expense.  In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the most significant
adjustments affected long term debt and equity.

     financial statements for the Reorganized Company (period starting  
     September 30, 1993) are not comparable to those of the Predecessor 
     Company.   See Notes to the Financial Statements (Note 14) for additional 
     information.

(b)  The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income
     per common share for the Predecessor Company have not been presented
     because due to the Reorganization and implementation of Fresh Start
     Reporting, they are not comparable to subsequent periods.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


(Dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted and per share amounts)
NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations:  AM International, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware
corporation, distributes equipment and supplies, and provides services for the
graphics arts industry.  The Company is in process of executing plans to exit
its' machine manufacturing business, consistent with management's strategic
objectives.  The Company's continuing distributed products consist primarily of
pre-press equipment, supplies and services.  The Company has in excess of
50,000 customers, including small commercial printers, large quick print
franchises, company run in-house print shops, governmental agencies, and
educational institutions.  No individual customer accounts for more than 10% of
net revenue.

The Company's headquarters and primary operations are located in Mt. Prospect,
Illinois.  Products are distributed throughout the United States utilizing six
distribution facilities.  To a lesser extent, products are distributed
internationally through independent dealers.  The Company employs approximately
400 service technicians throughout the United States to provide technical
service and training.

Basis of Presentation: The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Reorganized
Company (period beginning September 30, 1993)  and the Predecessor Company
(periods prior to September 30, 1993) include the accounts of AM International,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company").  All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.  The Company's fiscal year end is July 31.
All references to years, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the fiscal year.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with current
year presentation.

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, which includes
material, labor and overhead, determined by the first-in, first out (FIFO)
method, or market.

Properties, Equipment and Depreciation: Properties and Equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 30
years, primarily on a straight-line basis. The Company adjusts the net book
value to recognize impairments in accordance with "SFAS 121: Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of."

Intangibles: Excess reorganization values are amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods not exceeding 20 years.  Identifiable intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Accumulated amortization of excess reorganization value was  $2,472 at July 31,
1996 and $2,065 at July 31, 1995.   The Company continually evaluates current
events and circumstances in order to determine whether the estimated useful
lives and recorded balances of excess reorganization value have been impaired.
The Company utilizes evaluations of estimated undiscounted future cash flows
and financial ratios in this review.

Currency Translation: Foreign assets and liabilities have been translated into
United States dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates,
and revenues and expenses have been translated at the average exchange rates in
effect during each period.  Translation adjustments are reported as a separate
component of Shareholders  Equity.  Exchange gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions are included in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations and are not material.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized from sales when a product is
shipped.  Amounts billed for service contracts are credited to Service Contract
Deferred Income and recognized as revenues over the term of the contracts.  The
Company recognizes warranty and equipment installation expenses at the time a
product is shipped, if applicable.  The expense is estimated considering
current warranty policies and historical expense.

Research and Development Expense: Expenses for research and development are
charged to income as incurred.  For the reorganized company, such expenses were
$364 in 1996, $744 in 1995, and $559 in 1994.  Such expenses were $95  for the
Predecessor Company in 1994.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided based on the liability method of
accounting pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
109, " Accounting for Income Taxes."  Deferred income taxes are recorded to
reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end.

Income per Common Share: Income per share amounts are determined after
deducting any dividend requirements of preferred shares and are based on the
weighted average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during each period.

Financial Instruments: The carrying value of financial instruments approximates
fair market value of those assets and liabilities.

Future Adoption of Accounting Standards:  In fiscal 1997, the Company is
required to adopt "SFAS 123: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."  The
adoption of this accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact
on the financial statements.

NOTE 2 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS


In August 1996, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of  the Sheridan Systems division for proceeds of
$50,100.  A loss of  $15,212 has been recorded in the fourth quarter of the
Company's fiscal year ended July 31, 1996 as a result of the transaction, with
no recorded tax benefit.

During the year, the Company completed the exit of its AM Multigraphics -
International subsidiaries with the sale of its subsidiaries in the Netherlands,
France, and Belgium and the placement of the Company's AM Multigraphics UK
holding company into an Administration Proceeding.  The sale of the subsidiaries
in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium required the Company to provide
consideration of approximately $3,000 in the form of cash and other assets.  No
gain or loss was recorded as a result of the exit of the AM Multigraphics -
International subsidiaries.

The results of these discontinued business units are included in the
consolidated statements of income under "discontinued operations."  The
following table summarizes key financial data related to the above discontinued
operations:

The results of operations, net of taxes, and the net assets of Sheridan Systems
and the divested AM Multigraphics - International operations are presented in
the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.  Interest
expense pertaining to the Company's Revolving Credit Facility has been
allocated based upon the ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations
to the consolidated capitalization of the Company.  Continuing operations and
discontinued operations reflect the net tax benefit or tax expense generated by
the respective operations, limited, however, by the income tax benefit or tax
expense recognized in the Company's historical financial statements.  No
general corporate expenses have been allocated to the discontinued operations.
The results of the discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of
the results of operations which may have been obtained had the continuing and
discontinued operations been operating independently.

The Company maintained a $25,000 three year secured domestic Revolving Credit
Facility (subject to borrowing base limitations) which expired October 12, 1996
with BT Commercial Corporation and LaSalle National Bank.  The Revolving Credit
Facility included a $10,000 sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit.
As of July 31, 1996, the calculated borrowing base was approximately $18,400.
As security for utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company
granted a security interest and general lien upon its domestic assets.  As of
July 31, 1996 the Company had borrowings of $5,430 under the Revolving Credit
Facility and was utilizing $3,347 of the facility to secure outstanding letters
of credit.  Interest was charged at a rate of 1.75% in excess of the prime
lending rate of Bankers Trust Company.  Letter of credit fees were 2.5% per
annum plus a 0.5% facing fee on standby letters of credit and 1.5% per annum on
commercial documentary letters of credit.  As of July 31, 1996, the interest
rate was 10.0%.

The Revolving Credit Facility agreement contained restrictive covenants which
limited capital expenditures, restricted the payment of dividends and other
payments and provided for quarterly measures of pretax net income and interest
coverage, among other things.  In addition, the agreement limited the Company's
ability to borrow or to request letters of credit following a material adverse
change as determined by the lenders.

In August, 1996 the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of the Sheridan Systems division for proceeds of $50,100.
The proceeds of the sale were used in part to pay off all outstanding
borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and to cash collateralize
outstanding letters of credit.  At September 28, the Company had a cash balance
of $41,228 after repaying bank debt and meeting other short term obligations.
The Company is currently seeking to obtain new banking facilities to provide
for the issuance of letters of credit, fund selected customer financing
programs, and increase liquidity to the Company.

NOTE 3 - BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

On October 13, 1993 the Company concluded a reorganization when the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the Company's
Plan of Reorganization (Plan).  The Plan provides that holders of allowed
general unsecured claims receive cash payments toward satisfaction of the full
amount of their claims in equal quarterly payments payable on the last business
day of each calendar quarter ending after October 13, 1993 over a five-year
period, together with interest at 5% per annum.  Holders of priority tax claims
are paid 10% of the allowed claim together with accrued and unpaid interest at
8% per annum on the then outstanding amount on each anniversary of October 13,
1993 which occurs prior to the sixth anniversary of the date of assessment and
the balances of such claims along with accrued and unpaid interest on the sixth
anniversary.  For financial reporting purposes interest on general unsecured
claims has been imputed at 9% per annum.  At July 31, 1996 the Company had $872
of restricted cash which primarily pertains to the settlement of disputed claims
in accordance with the Plan.

As of July 31, 1996, aggregate maturities of total debt, excluding capitalized
leases, are as follows:

Cash paid for interest was $2,282 during 1996, $1,103 during fiscal 1995, 
and $655 for the ten months ended of the Reorganized Company in 1994. 
The Predecessor Company paid no interest in the two months ended 1994.

NOTE 4 - CAPITAL STRUCTURE


The Company s charter authorizes 50 million shares of stock, of which 40
million shares are reserved for issuance as Common Stock and 10 million shares
are reserved for issuance as Preferred Stock.  The Board of Directors has
authorized the issuance of 7,010,000 of such shares of $.01 par value Common
Stock.  Of these shares, 7,000,000 were issued on the effective date to holders
of claims and interests as described in Note 14.  In addition, the Company
issued Warrants on the Effective Date to purchase 1,095,000 shares of Common
Stock.  The Warrants were exercisable at $18.00 per share and expired on
October 15, 1996.  No  warrants were exercised prior to their expiration.  As
of July 31, 1996 the Company has not yet issued any Preferred Stock.  The
Common Stock and all other equity securities issued under the new charter are
voting securities (although the voting rights of any preferred stock issued
would differ from those of the Common Stock) and will not have any preemptive
rights to subscribe for additional shares.  The Common Stock is not subject to
conversion or redemption and when issued is fully paid and non-assessable.

NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


The Company received creditor claims during its bankruptcy proceedings which
the Company believes are duplicative, erroneous or exaggerated and to which the
Company believes it has valid defenses.  The Company has filed objections to
these disputed claims in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  As of
July 31, 1995 and July 31, 1996, disputed claims amounted to $50,700 and
$31,300, respectively.  The disputed claims are primarily comprised of
environmental and product liability claims.  The Company has been notified of
various environmental matters in connection with certain current or former
Company locations in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
In the third quarter of 1996 the Company recorded a $2,800 favorable adjustment
due to the resolution of legal disputes which had been previously reserved.
The Company is also involved in various other administrative and legal
proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability and general
liability lawsuits against which the Company is partially insured.  The
disputed claims are in many cases in excess of recorded reserves.  At the
present time, it is management s opinion, based on information available to the
Company and management s experience in such matters, that the resolution of
these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company has sold certain receivables related to machine sales, subject to
recourse provisions and repurchase provisions.  Management believes
unreserved exposures pertaining to these contingencies will not materially
impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Sec. 382 ownership change which resulted from the 1993 bankruptcy
reorganization imposed a limitation on the usage of pre-reorganization domestic
tax operating loss carryforwards.  Usage of this loss carryforward is limited
to $3,689 per year or $55,335 for a period of 15 years following the ownership
change.  In addition, as of July 31, 1996 the Company had domestic tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $131,000 attributable to post-reorganization
periods and therefore not subject to limitation.  The domestic tax loss
carryforwards will expire from 1997 to 2011.  The AMT credit, although subject
to the Sec. 382 limitation, has no expiration date.

During 1996, the deferred tax asset increased by $13,300 primarily due to the
creation of additional domestic loss carryforwards.  Due to the uncertainty as
to the realizability of the deferred tax assets, the Company has established
valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS No. 109 to offset the asset.

To the extent the Company realizes a tax benefit as a result of future
reductions in the valuation allowance related to the utilization of
pre-reorganization deferred tax assets, fresh start accounting rules provide
for the reporting of such benefit first by reducing "Reorganization Value in
Excess of Amounts Allocable to Identifiable Assets" and thereafter increasing
Capital in excess of par value.  Although the future recognition of this
benefit will have no impact on net earnings, the Company will realize a cash
benefit from utilization of the "Pre-Reorganization Benefits" against any
future tax liabilities.

NOTE 7 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION


The Company's 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of
1,400,000 shares of new $.01 par value Common Stock.  Options to purchase the
Common Stock are awarded at a price not less than 100% of the market price on
the date of grant, which becomes exercisable at various dates generally from
one to four years after the date of grant, and expire ten years after the date
of grant.  In the event a holder of options is no longer employed by the
Company, the unvested shares are cancelled upon the employee's termination and
any vested shares must be excercised within 90 days or they are also cancelled.
The number of shares outstanding at the end of 1996 includes 57,200 unvested
and 35,336 vested shares with an option price range of $2.130 - $9.625 which
are held by Sheridan Systems employees.  The unvested shares were cancelled on
the date of the Sheridan Systems sale, August 27, 1996, and the vested shares
may be exercised by no later than November 25, 1996.

NOTE 8 - UNUSUAL ITEMS

During 1996, the Company committed to certain restructuring actions in an
effort to realign the operations with established strategic objectives.   The
restructuring actions are summarized as follows:

On August 27, 1996 the Company completed the sale of substantially all the
assets of its Sheridan Systems division.  As a result of the event, "Change in
Control" provisions included within employment agreements of certain Company
executives were activated.  Total charges pertaining to such provisions amounted
to $1,250 and were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.

In conjunction with the Sheridan Systems sale and in an effort to reduce costs,
management committed to a plan to close its Corporate headquarters and
consolidate certain functions within the AM Multigraphics operations.  This
decision ultimately will result in the termination of seven employees, including
three officers.  Severance and benefits associated with these terminations
amounted to $1,595.

During the fourth quarter, the Company committed to a plan to exit its Canadian
subsidiary.  On October 17, 1996 the subsidiary filed for a voluntary
assignment in bankruptcy.  In connection with the exit plan, reserves were
established to write-off net assets of the operation.  The Canadian subsidiary
had revenues of $9,951, $10,285 and $11,557 in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

During the year, management finalized plans to exit the machine manufacturing
business and consolidate its field sales and service facilities.  Costs
associated with the exit plan are comprised primarily of facility closure
costs, disposal of manufacturing equipment and severance costs.  The Company
began implementation of such plans during the fourth quarter and anticipates
all actions to be completed within one year.

NOTE 10 - RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company maintains defined contribution retirement plans for  domestic
employees comprised of savings plans (401(k)) and a  Retirement Accumulation
Plan.   Contributions to these  plans take  the form  of (i)  company
contributions to match a  portion of employee contribution  and (ii)
contributions  made at the discretion  of the Board of Directors.  The
Company's contributions to the domestic defined contribution plans  were $1,317,
$1,778  and $2,019  for  the Reorganized  Company  in  1996, 1995  and  1994
respectively,  and  $403 for  the Predecessor Company in 1994.

The Company also maintains defined benefit pension plans for certain U.S.
employees under a Company maintained plan.   The components of net periodic
pension cost for these plans are shown below for 1996, 1995 and 1994:

NOTE 10 - RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)

The assumed discount rate on benefit obligations was 7.0% in 1996 and 1995.  
The assumed rates of compensation increases were 4.0% in 1996 and 3.3% in 1995.

The Company's operations in Canada and Japan also maintain defined benefit
pension plans.  The unfunded benefit obligation for Japan amounted to $3,508 in
1996 and $4,519 in 1995.  The prepaid pension cost in Canada was $3,114 in
1996 and $3,015 in 1995.  The combined net periodic pension cost was $290 in
1996, $327 in 1995 and $258 in 1994.  Such expenses were $60 for the
Predecessor Company in 1994.  As discussed in Note 8 and Note 15, the Company
completed the exit of these operations in the first quarter of 1997.

In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides limited life insurance
and health care benefits to certain domestic retired employees and provides for
certain medical and life insurance benefits for retirees of previously closed
manufacturing locations.  The effect of adopting SFAS 106 was
not material.

Net post-retirement life and health care cost includes the following
components:

NOTE 10 - RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)

If the health care cost trend rates were increased 1% for all future years, the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have increased 0.1% at July
31, 1996.  The effect of this change on the aggregate of service and interest
cost would have been an increase of 4.9% for 1996.  A 13% increase in the
health care cost trend rate was assumed for retirees under age 65 and an 11.0%
increase for those over the age of 65.  These rates are assumed to decrease
gradually to 5.5% in the year 2003.

NOTE 14 - PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND FRESH START REPORTING

The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the
Company's Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) on September 29, 1993 (the
Confirmation Date), which allowed the Company to emerge from Chapter 11
Bankruptcy effective October 13, 1993 (the Effective Date).  The Company
operated under the protection of Chapter 11 following a voluntary petition for
reorganization filed May 17, 1993.  The Plan provided for the issuance of
approximately seven million new shares of common stock and distributions to
major creditors and shareholders.  The holders of the Company's 12% senior
subordinated debentures received nearly 97% of the new common stock with the
balance of the new common stock distributed to preferred stock and common stock
holders.  General unsecured creditors receive quarterly cash payments for five
years with payments commencing December 31, 1993.  All distributions were made
in accordance with the plan provisions.

The distribution of shares of the new Common Stock and Warrants commenced on
October 13, 1993.  The new Common Stock and new Warrants became listed on the
American Stock Exchange on December 6, 1993.

Fresh Start Reporting

As of the Confirmation Date, the Company adopted Fresh Start Reporting in
accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position 90-7 (SOP 90-7) -- "Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code."  Fresh Start Reporting resulted in
material changes to the consolidated balance sheet, including valuation of
assets and liabilities at fair market value and valuation of equity based on
the appraised reorganization value of the ongoing business.

The Company recorded a reorganization value of $36,000 (the approximate fair
value) which was based on the consideration of many factors and various
valuation methods, including discounted cash flows and price/earnings and other
applicable ratios and valuation techniques believed by management and its
financial advisors to be representative of the Company's business and industry.
The excess of the reorganization value over the fair value of net assets and
liabilities is reported as excess reorganization value and is amortized over a
twenty year period.

The Reorganization and the adoption of Fresh Start Reporting resulted in the
following adjustments to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for
the period ended September 29, 1993:

NOTE 15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company committed to sell all of its
ownership interest in its majority owned Japanese subsidiary.  On September 20,
1996 the Company completed the sale of its 2,148,000 shares of AM Japan Co.,
Ltd, and the Company received proceeds of approximately $10,600, net of
certain costs.   At July 31, 1996, the Company's investment in the subsidiary
amounted to $7,698 and is reflected as "Net assets held for sale" in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.  This amount consists primarily of receivables,
inventory, property and equipment, intangible assets, net of accounts payable
and accrued liabilities.  A gain of approximately $2,600 will be recorded by
the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 as a result of the sale.

On October 29, 1996 the Company entered into a definitive Merger Purchase
Agreement with a corporation newly formed by affiliates of Pacholder
Associates, Inc., a Cincinnati-based provider of investment management,
financial advisory and investment banking services to institutional clients. 
The agreement provides for the merger of a subsidiary of purchaser with and
into the Company pursuant to which the current shareholders of the Company will
receive $5.00 per common share and the Company will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the purchaser.  The transaction is conditioned upon the purchaser
finalizing a credit facility within 30 days.  The transaction is subject to a
number of additional conditions, including approval by a majority of the
shareholders of the Company at a meeting tentatively scheduled for
January, 1997.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Shareholders and the
Board of Directors of 
AM International, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AM
International, Inc. (Reorganized Company) and subsidiaries as of July 31, 1996
and 1995 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
period from September 30, 1993 through July 31, 1994.  We have also audited the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows of AM International, Inc. (Predecessor Company) and subsidiaries for the
period from August 1, 1993 through September 29, 1993.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of AM International, Inc.
(Reorganized Company) and subsidiaries as of July 31, 1996 and 1995 and the
results of their operations and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 1996
and 1995, and for the period from September 30, 1993 through July 31, 1994 and
the results of operations and cash flows of AM International, Inc. (Predecessor
Company) for the period from August 1, 1993 through September 29, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Subject:  TERMS OF SEPARATION


This is to summarize the terms of our agreement concerning your separation of
employment from AM International, Inc. and Sheridan systems:

      -    You have elected to take early retirement effective January 19, 1996.

      -    Commencing January 22, 1996 and continuing through October 11, 1996,
      you will serve as a consultant to the Company, reporting directly to me,
      and you will work on any transaction that surfaces or on such general
      matters pertaining to the Sheridan Systems business as I may reasonably
      request from time-to-time.  Your consulting fee will equal your current
      salary and will be paid as salary on the same basis as it historically
      has been paid.  This arrangement will terminate prior to October 11, 1996
      in the event of your acceptance of full time employment with another
      employer or for "cause."  "Cause," for purposes of this agreement, shall
      mean a significant failure to cooperate with any reasonable requests to
      assist in the process of any transaction concerning the Sheridan Systems
      Division or AM International, Inc. or any material disparagement of the
      Company.  You agree to make business trips as may reasonably be requested
      and the Company will reimburse you upon the submission of expense reports
      and in accordance with Company policies.

      -    Commencing October 12, 1996, you will begin receiving your SRP
      payments, in accordance with your letter agreement of February 4, 1994
      (the "SRP"), on a monthly basis.  The Compensation and Nominating
      Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Board of Directors or
      appropriate committee of any successor or assignee to the Company's
      interests thereafter would consider no more frequently than annually
      whether the benefit payable to you under the SRP should be paid on a
      lump-sum present value basis.  Your receipt of SRP benefits will not be
      affected by your acceptance of any other employment.

      -    As provided in your letter agreement of November 13, 1992, the vested
      portions of your RAP, SERP, and 401(k) plans will be paid to you in
      accordance with the plan documents.  For a period of two years after
      March 31, 1996 or your
      commencement of full time employment with another employer, whichever
      occurs first, you will be entitled to the same group medical, life
      insurance, supplemental executive health plan and long term disability
      benefits as are available to other officers of AM on the date hereof, as
      well as tax planning and return preparation services through Cortland
      Brovitz (Rochester, N.Y.) and financial planning services through Chase
      Lincoln First National Bank.  Following the expiration of your group
      health benefits as provided above, you will be entitled to participate in
      Sheridan Systems' Retiree Health Plan.

      outplacement services or as you deem appropriate.

      -    Your rights under the Change in Control and Termination Benefits
      Agreement dated July 7, 1995 are hereby terminated and such Agreement is
      hereby canceled and terminated.

      -    You will be entitled to keep the personal computer and fax machine
      currently in use at your home.

      -    We agreed that you will be provided secretarial services by Joanne
      Trecaso or another Sheridan Systems employee on an as needed basis.  We
      also agreed that you will have a phone number, secretarial answering
      service and voice mail (if you should choose) service at the Corporate
      offices in Rosemont, Illinois, through October 10, 1996.

      -    You will be entitled to attend two trade association shows this 
      winter or spring (and others as may reasonably be requested) and the
      Company will pay your reasonable travel and expenses in relation to those
      activities upon submission of expense reports as provided above.

      -    You will be paid in a lump sum for any earned but unused vacation, in
      accordance with Company policies.

      -    We will make an organizational announcement jointly approved by you
      and me.  Forms of the announcements are attached hereto, evidencing our
      mutual agreement.

To AM International, Inc.:

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
consolidated financial statements included in AM International, Inc.'s Annual
Report to Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have
issued our report thereon dated October 29, 1996. Our audit was made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The
schedule listed in Part IV, Item 14(A)(2) is the responsibility of the Company's
management and is presented for the purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
states in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
