It has three businesses within these industries: Animal Health, U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals and Human Pharmaceuticals International.  In January, 2001, the Aquatic Animal Health Division became a part of the Animal Health Division and, for all management and financial purposes and for 2001 and all subsequent periods, will no longer be reported as a separate business segment.  This combined segment has now been renamed Animal Health.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2001 the human pharmaceutical business segments were realigned.  The US Pharmaceutical Division changed its name to U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals.   On December 12, 2001, the Purepac and Faulding Labs businesses which were acquired through the Acquisition were placed within this business segment.  Additionally, the Fine Chemicals Division, which develops, manufactures and markets active pharmaceutical
 ingredients (""APIs"") to the pharmaceutical industry for use in finished products was combined with the International Pharmaceuticals Division for management purposes, however, the Fine Chemical and International Pharmaceuticals businesses will remain separate business segments for financial reporting purposes. This combined business has now been renamed Human Pharmaceuticals International.   As a result of the Acquisition, Foshan Faulding was added to the Human Pharmaceuticals International business. </P>

<P>Human Pharmaceuticals</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company''s human pharmaceuticals business is comprised of the U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals and Human Pharmaceuticals International businesses.  Each of these businesses are managed by a separate senior management team although the Company has embarked on a long-term strategy which is intended to result in the partial or full combination of these businesses into a single, integrated business. The Company''s human pharmaceutical business had sales of approximately $643.8 million in 2001, before elimination of intercompany sales, with operating profit of approximately $23.7 million.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Generic pharmaceuticals, which are the primary products of the U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals and Human Pharmaceuticals International businesses, are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of brand-name drugs.  Generic pharmaceuticals are required to meet the same governmental quality standards as brand-name drugs and most must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authority prior to manufacture and sale. A manufacturer cannot produce or market a generic pharmaceutical until all relevant patents (and any additional government-mandated market exclusivity periods) covering the original brand-name product have expired, or until the manufacturer can develop a product which meets the chemical and therapeutic equivalency standards required by applicable law without infringing any valid patents held by the brand-name manufacturer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&#9;As a result of the Acquisition, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P>Human Pharmaceuticals International (""HPI"") </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
           </B>The Company''s Human Pharmaceuticals International business develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceuticals for human use and active pharmaceutical ingredients for use in finished dose products.  The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of generic oral solid dose pharmaceuticals in Europe, with a substantial presence in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordic countries and The Netherlands.  HPI also has a significant presence in Southeast Asia.  HPI benefits from over four decades of experience in the use and development of fermentation and purification technology.  Additionally, HPI''s fermentation expertise in the production of bulk antibiotics has a direct technological application to the manufacture of products for the Company''s animal pharmaceuticals business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carl-Aake Carlsson will continue managing the combined international human pharmaceutical and fine chemical businesses.  Mr. Carlsson managed the international human pharmaceutical businesses prior to the combination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<I>&#9;Product Lines. </I>The Human Pharmaceuticals International business manufactures products using approximately 225 APIs that are sold in approximately 600 different formulations and dosage forms including prescription and over-the-counter tablets, capsules, ointments, creams, liquids, suppositories and injections.  HPI markets and sells approximately 10 APIs in 28 formulations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;HPI''s European sales of generic pharmaceuticals in 2001 decreased as generic pharmaceuticals faced pricing weakness in several of the European markets including the United Kingdom and Germany.  Additionally, increased competition on high margin products in the UK negatively impacted HPI''s business.  HPI''s sales of fine chemical products in 2001 increased.  HPI''s product lines include prescription pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter products and fine chemical products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prescription Pharmaceuticals</I></U>.<I>  </I>HPI has regulatory approvals for approximately 500 prescription products with a concentration on prescription drug antibiotics, analgesics/antirheumatics, psychotropics and cardiovascular products.  These products are predominantly sold on a generic basis.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over-the-Counter Products</U>.  </I>HPI has regulatory approvals for approximately 100 over-the-counter products.  HPI has a broad range of products for skin care, gastrointestinal care and pain relief.  Its range of products also includes other products such as vitamins, fluoride tablets, adhesive bandages and surgical tapes, among others.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fine Chemical Products</U>.</I>  HPI''s fine chemical products constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections.  The Company is the world''s leading producer of bacitracin and polymyxin, and a leading producer of vancomycin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics.  HPI also manufactures other antibiotics such as amphotericin B parenteral grade and colistin for injectable use and use in specialized topical and surgical human applications.  In 1997 the Company received approval to sell vancomycin in the U.S.  To support this new product, the Company substantially expanded its production capacity at its Copenhagen facility and acquired a facility in Budapest, Hungary in December 1998.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Acquisitions</I>.  In May 1998, the Company acquired Arthur H. Cox and Co. Ltd. (now renamed Alpharma Limited), the third largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturer in the United Kingdom, from Hoechst AG for a purchase price of approximately $198.0 million.  Alpharma Limited manufactures and markets tablets, capsules, suppositories, liquids, ointments and creams.  Alpharma Limited''s main operations, which consist primarily of a manufacturing plant, warehousing facilities and a sales organization, are located in Barnstaple, England.  Alpharma Limited distributes its products to pharmacy retailers and pharmaceuticals wholesalers, primarily in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition, in November 1998 and April 1999, in substantially smaller transactions, the Company acquired generic pharmaceutical product lines in Germany and France.  All of the products purchased in these transactions are manufactured under long-term contracts with third parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In June 1999, the Company acquired a leading market presence in the German generic market through the purchase of the Isis group of companies (now renamed Alpharma-ISIS GmbH &amp; Co.) from Schwarz Pharma AG for a purchase price of approximately $153.0 million. Alpharma-ISIS has a substantial marketing organization but no manufacturing operations.  All products are manufactured for Alpharma-ISIS by third parties, including a substantial number (including Pentalong&trade;) under a supply agreement with Schwarz Pharma which expires in 2008 (with annual renewal rights upon mutual agreement of the parties).  Approximately 80% of Alpharma-ISIS'' sales are of cardiovascular products, the most important of which in terms of sales is the drug Pentalong&trade;.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As a result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired 90% of the ownership of Foshan Faulding.  Foshan City  owns the other 10% of Foshan Faulding.  Foshan Faulding manufactures and distributes generic oral pharmaceutical products in the southern portion of China and plans to expand marketing activities to the Eastern provinces during 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company intends to continue the operations of Alpharma Limited, Alpharma-Isis and the smaller German, French and Chinese generic product lines to achieve benefits from leveraging these new activities with the other businesses of HPI.  In addition, the Company has integrated the businesses acquired into a pan-European generics business and plans to expand the scope of the acquired operations by adding to the acquired product base certain other pharmaceutical products of the Company.  The Company is continuing to review market expansion opportunities in Europe and Asia.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Facilities. </I>The Company maintains eight manufacturing facilities for its HPI products, all of which also house administrative offices and warehouse space.  The Company''s plants in Lier, Norway and Barnstaple, England, include many technologically advanced applications for the manufacturing of tablet, liquid and ointment products.  The Company''s plant in Copenhagen, Denmark manufactures a limited number of sterile finished pharmaceutical products.  In addition to the Lier, Barnstaple and Copenhagen facilities, the Company also operates plants in Vennesla, Norway, for bandages and surgical tape products, and Jakarta, Indonesia, for tablets, ointments and liquids.  The Jakarta plant has received regulatory approval to export certain products to Europe.  Through Foshan Faulding, the Company also operates a manufacturing plant in Foshan City in the Guangdong Province of China.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 1998, the Company (i) consolidated its international tablet, ointment and liquid production by transferring its production operations from Copenhagen to the Lier facility and third-party manufacturers and (ii) consolidated its sterile production by transferring its production operations from Norway to the Copenhagen facility and to third-party manufacturers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company manufactures its fine chemical products in its plants in Oslo, Norway, which also manufactures products for the Company''s Animal Health business; Copenhagen, Denmark, which also manufactures finished products for HPI; and Budapest, Hungary.  Each plant includes fermentation, specialized recovery and purification equipment.  A material upgrade in manufacturing processes and capacity at the Budapest facility is substantially complete.  All of these facilities have been approved as a manufacturer of certain sterile and non-sterile bulk antibiotics by the FDA, which allows imports of these products into the U.S. market, and by the health authorities of some European countries.  See ""Information Applicable to all Business Segments- Environmental Compliance"" for a discussion of an administrative action related to the Budapest facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Competition.  </I>Most of the Company''s international finished pharmaceutical products compete with one or more other products that contain the same active ingredient so the Company therefore competes on the basis of price, service and brand.  In European countries in recent years, sales of generic pharmaceuticals have been increasing relative to sales of patent-protected pharmaceuticals.  Generics are gaining market share because, among other things, governments are attempting to reduce pharmaceutical expenses by enacting regulations that promote the use of generic pharmaceuticals in lieu of more expensive branded formulations.  The Company''s international pharmaceutical products also encounter competition from imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws promoting free movement of goods. (See ""Risk Factors"").  Additionally, in the United Kingdom and Germany, new legislation is resulting in lower prices and reduction in revenues.  In the United Kingdom,
 the United Kingdom Department of Health is continuing to review proposed legislative changes to the United Kingdom generic pharmaceuticals market, and as part of this review introduced in August 2000 interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.  These price controls are expected to remain in place until October 2002.  This interim pricing legislation as well as competitive factors has resulted in lower prices for the Company''s human generic pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom and may lead to further price reductions for the Company''s generic human pharmaceuticals products. (See ""Risk Factors"").  New legislation was introduced in Germany in January 2002 which re-adjusted the existing fixed price system, requiring price reductions for a large number of the Company''s human generic pharmaceutical products in Germany.  Additionally, while the new German law does permit pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs there are seve
ral exceptions to this law which, in the Company''s view, will make it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  Overall the Company expects this legislation to result in lower prices for the Company''s human generic pharmaceutical products in Germany and a decrease in profitability.  (See ""Risk Factors"").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&#9;Sales of bulk antibiotic products are made to relatively few large customers.   In sales to large and small customers, price, quality and service are the determining factors.  The Company believes that its fermentation and purification expertise and established reputation provide it with a competitive advantage in these antibiotic products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Geographic Markets.  </I>The principal geographic markets for HPI''s finished pharmaceutical products are the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands, France, the Nordic and other Western European countries, Indonesia, China and the Middle East.  Additionally, HPI sells its fine chemical products in the U.S.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, sales in the U.S. of HPI''s fine chemical products represented approximately 13% of HPI''s total revenues with significant additional sales of fine chemical products in Europe, Asia and Latin America.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Sales and Distribution and Customers.  </I>Depending on the characteristics of each geographic market, generic products are predominantly marketed under either brand or generic names.  Over-the-counter products are typically marketed under brand names with concentration on skin care, pain relief and vitamins.  HPI employs a specialized marketing and sales force of approximately 595 persons, 180, 100 and 115 of whom are in Indonesia, China and Germany, respectively, that markets and promotes generic pharmaceuticals to doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and consumers.  In each of the Company''s international markets, it uses wholesalers to distribute its generic pharmaceutical products.  The Company distributes and sells its fine chemical products in North America and Europe using its own sales force.  Sales of the Company''s fine chemical products in other parts of the world are primarily through the use of local agents and distributors.</P>

With over 200 products USHP is a market leader in generic solid, liquid and topical dosage forms with what the Company believes to be one of the broadest portfolios of these products in the generic pharmaceuticals industry and with what it believes is a substantial presence in generic over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.  With approximately 60 over-the-counter products, the Company is increasing its presence as a significant supplier to major retailers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company recently announced new management of its U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business segment.

The prescription products consist of a broad line of specialty liquid products in approximately 12 different categories including cough/cold, allergy and respiratory, a broad line of creams and ointments with a concentration on first aid medications, and a broad line of oral solid products with a concentration on modified release formulations in a variety of therapeutic categories including cardiovascular, anti-depressants, tranquilizers and analgesics.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Formulations</U>.</I>  USHP''s prescription and over-the-counter generic pharmaceutical products are sold in tablet, capsule, liquid, creams, lotions, ointments, suppositories, aerosols and other specialty formulations. The experience and technical know-how of USHP enables it to formulate immediate and modified release medications in oral solid dosage forms, to develop therapeutic equivalent drugs in liquid and topical forms, and to refine product characteristics such as taste, texture and appearance in the case of liquid forms and color, texture and consistency in the case of topical forms. USHP manufactures and markets seven suppository products and certain other specialty generic products, including a line of nasal spray products, one aerosol and four nebulizer products.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHP''s most successful generic drugs in 2001 were diltiazem, the oral solid dose generic equivalent of Cardizem CD&reg; indicated for the treatment of hypertension and chronic, stable angina, and spironolactone the oral solid dose generic equivalent of Aldactone&reg; indicated in the management of primary hyperaldosteronism and edematous conditions (the retention of water) for patients with a number of medical conditions including congestive heart failure. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Branded Product Lines</B>.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHP''s branded pharmaceuticals business, which was founded in 1998 markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals.  USHP''s primary branded product is Kadian&reg;, a sustained release morphine product which USHP licenses from F.H. Faulding (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mayne) pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license. USHP also sells Serax &reg; brand capsules and tablets, an anti-anxiety product, for which the Company acquired the marketing and distribution rights from a third party in November 1999. The branded pharmaceutical business has built a sales force of approximately 60 people. USHP focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the medical specialists who are likely to be the most active writers of prescriptions for its products. In addition to its sales and marketing efforts the Company continues to seek product development and co-promotion opportunities with other pharmaceutical companies to enhance its product portfolio and to expand the scope of its efforts.  However, no 
assurances can be given that such partnerships will be successfully created.  In addition USHP sells FeverAll&reg;, an over-the-counter suppository form of acetaminophen used for fever reduction and pain relief. The Company acquired the marketing and distribution rights for this product from a third party in December 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Facilities.  </I>USHP maintains and operates four manufacturing facilities, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and two automated central distribution centers.  USHP''s largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid and nasal spray pharmaceuticals.  The Company''s facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories.  As a result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac''s oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, which is in the FDA validation process for future manufacturing and which the Company anticipates will be fully functional by mid-2003.  As an additional result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired a lease for a distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee, which it operates in addition to the distribution facility USHP already leased
 in Columbia, Maryland.  USHP''s current and projected business needs do not require maintaining both distribution facilities.  Therefore, the Company is devising a strategy to consolidate the distribution function in the Maryland facility.  This strategy may include closing the Memphis distribution center within the next 12 months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Competition.  </I>&#9;Although the Company is a market leader in the U.S. in the manufacture and marketing of specialty human generic pharmaceuticals, it operates in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company competes with other generic pharmaceutical companies and with the generic drug divisions of major international patented drug companies and encounters market entry resistance from patented drug manufacturers.  The Company selectively attempts to introduce generic drugs, as it is currently attempting with Gabapentin, earlier than the last expiration date for patents held by the manufacturer holding the patent protection through the process of designing around existing patents or challenging patents believed to be invalid.  The Company has encountered vigorous challenges to these activities which has resulted in significant legal costs as it has defended its right to market these products.  The Company expects to face further legal costs as it continues to defend 
such challenges.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company believes that its Animal Health business is a global leader in the development, registration, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products for food producing animals including poultry, cattle, sheep and swine, and vaccines to protect farmed fish from disease.  In 2001, the Company had animal health product sales of approximately $335.3 million, before elimination of intercompany sales, with operating profit of approximately $23.6 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;AH''s sales and operating income in 2001 was adversely affected as a result of (i) a change in its marketing strategy which decreased the offering of both extended payment terms and price discounts and (ii) declining poultry product sales caused in part by weak conditions in the U.S. poultry market, together with softness in Asian markets.  In addition, AH''s blending facility and warehouse in Lowell, Arkansas were closed beginning in late September due to a fire.  In December 2001, certain portions of the facility were re-opened for operation.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company recently announced new management of its Animal Health business and will immediately begin exploring changes in market strategy in this business.  The clear objectives of any new strategy will include:  strengthening customer and market focus, stabilizing pricing, and significantly improving working capital management.  The development and execution of this strategy will be led by Carol Wrenn, the new President of the Animal Health division. As a first step, the Company has reduced the use of certain U.S. sales incentives in this division.  These incentives had the effect of increasing the Company''s level of accounts receivable.  While the Company will continue to offer its products to all customers on what it believes to be competitive terms, this action had a negative effect on AH''s sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 and is expected to have a further significant negative impact on sales in the first quarter of 2002 as customers reduce inventories.    See ""Risk Factors
"".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As an additional part of AH''s new marketing strategy, it is conducting a review of its new product pipeline and an evaluation of its major contractual relationships.  The Company believes that certain changes to the existing arrangements may be necessary.  Write-offs and other charges against pre-tax income of approximately $12.3 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with such matters.  Such changes could result in further short term decreases in revenues or operating income.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is the case for human pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals for animals (including animal biologics and vaccines) must be reviewed and receive registration from the FDA, USDA or similar regulatory agencies in other countries.  Regulatory approvals for products to be used in food producing animals are complex, due to the possible impact on humans. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Approval must also be granted in the U.S. for the use of a pharmaceutical product in combination with other pharmaceuticals, and this generally requires the cooperation of other manufacturers.  To date, the Company has been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many of its products.  These combination clearances significantly extend the reach and market share of the Company''s products and provide a considerable competitive advantage.  Presently, the Company has sponsored a total of approximately 85 combination approvals in the U.S.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Acquisitions</I>.  In 1997, the Company acquired the Deccox product line, brand name and certain related assets from Rhone-Poulenc''s Animal Nutrition Division.  Deccox is used to prevent and control coccidiosis.  Under the agreement pursuant to which Deccox was acquired, Rhone-Poulenc will continue to manufacture the active ingredient for use in Deccox for a period of 15 years.    </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In 1999, the Company purchased the assets of I.D. Russell Company Laboratories, a manufacturer of a line of soluble antibiotics and vitamins.  In addition, in September 1999 the Company acquired exclusive marketing rights to Reporcin, a performance and meat quality improvement product for injectable use in swine pursuant to a technology license and option agreement.  Sales of Reporcin are ongoing in some countries, including Mexico and Brazil, which have substantial swine populations.  However, the full realization of the potential for Reporcin is dependent upon market acceptance in those two countries and governmental license approvals and market acceptance in numerous other countries, including the U.S..  The agreement requires payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets or payment of a liquidated damages fee for not pursuing licenses in such countries equal to 10% of the product license payment that would otherwise have become due upon
 receipt of the product license.  Total additional payments at December 31, 2001 of approximately $32.0 million are required over the next five years if all seven possible country approvals are received. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin. To meet this requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June of 2000 and began preparing the facility for production of Reporcin. Due to a reassessment of the Company''s approach to the US market, the facility, on which the Company has expended $12 million, was not complete at December 31, 2001. While the Company continues to pursue regulatory approval for Reporcin in the US, this reassessment has resulted in changes to or delays in planned activities related to the completion of the Terre Haute facility. However the Company has reviewed the facility for impairment and determined, based on present facts and circumstances, no write-
down of the facility is required at December 31, 2001. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In May 2000, the Company purchased the Roche MFA business for approximately $288.0 million.  The Roche MFA business consisted of products including Aureomycin, Bovatec, Avatec, Bio-Cox and Cygro.  These pharmaceuticals are used to prevent and treat diseases in livestock and poultry.  Roche MFA sales in 1999 were approximately $200.0 million with over 50% of these sales in North America and the remainder in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.  The Roche MFA acquisition included inventories, five manufacturing and formulation sites in the U.S., global product registrations, licenses, trademarks and associated intellectual property, and certain of the Roche employees, primarily in manufacturing and sales and marketing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Facilities.  </I>The Company produces its Animal Health products in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. BMD is produced and blended at the Company''s Chicago Heights, Illinois facility which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant.  Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility shared with HPI.  Soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH''s Longmont, Colorado facility and Reporcin is produced at the Company''s plant in Parkville, Australia.  Feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH''s Hannibal, Missouri and Willow Island, West Virginia facilities in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers.  It is then blended at independent blending facilities.  Bio-Cox is blended in AH''s Van Buren, Arkansas facility, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at its Salisbury, Maryland facility.  The 3-Nitro product line and Lasalocid are manufactured using the Company''s technology at separate third party facilities.  These contracts require the Company to purcha
se minimum yearly quantities on a cost plus basis.  The Company is in the process of preparing its Willow Island facility for manufacturing Lasalocid.  Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in accordance with a fifteen year agreement using the Company''s technology at an unrelated facility.  Blending of Deccox is done at the Company''s Lowell, Arkansas plant and a third party facility.  Product research and development is done at AH''s Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities, with an experimental farm in Wrightstown, New Jersey.  The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Competition.  </I>Some of the Company''s competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities.  Due to the Company''s strong market position in feed additives and its experience in obtaining requisite FDA approvals for combination therapies, the Company believes it enjoys a competitive advantage in commercializing FDA-approved combination medicated animal feed additives.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Geographic Markets.  </I>The Company sells a major portion of its animal health products in the U.S.  With the addition of the Roche MFA business, AH has expanded its international presence as part of its global strategy.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products in Norway, the United Kingdom, U.S., Chile and other international markets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Sales and Distribution.  </I>The Company''s animal health products in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and other selected markets are sold through a staff of technically trained sales and service employees.  The Company has sales offices in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Thailand, China, Brazil, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Australia.  The Company is currently reviewing whether to eliminate certain of AH''s present foreign sales offices.  In the remainder of the world, AH''s products are sold primarily through the use of distributors and sales companies.  In January 1999, the Company combined its wholly-owned U.S. distribution company with two similar third party distribution businesses to form a joint venture 50% owned by the Company.  The joint venture is a regional distributor of animal health products in the Central Southwest and Eastern regions of the U.S.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products through its own technicall
y-trained sales staff in Norway, the United Kingdom and Chile and through distributors in other markets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Customers.  </I>Sales are made principally to commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and integrated cattle, swine and poultry producers.  Although AH is not dependent on any one customer, the customer base for animal health products is in a consolidation phase.  Therefore, as consolidation continues, the Company may become more dependent on certain individual customers as these customers increase their size and market share.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products to fish farms, usually under a contract which extends for at least one growing season.  There are relatively few customers for the Company''s aquatic animal health products and there are relatively few suppliers of the products that the Company sells in this market.  Most large customers have veterinarians on their staff and the Company believes that these veterinarians are involved in the evaluation and purchase of AH''s products </P>

The Company''s research, product development and technical activities in the human pharmaceuticals business within the U.S. and Norway concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs.  The Company''s research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention development in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, fermentation technology and packaging and manufacturing techniques.  The Company''s research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products.  In v

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company''s technical development activities for animal pharmaceuticals involve extensive product development and testing for the primary purpose of establishing clinical support for new products and additional uses for variations of existing products and seeking related FDA and other governmental approvals.</P>

</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.  Accordingly, upon integration of the Company''s three business segments into two segments, research and development will be conducted on a two segment basis.  The Company conducts its technical product development activities at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Baltimore, Maryland; Wrightstown, New Jersey; Willow Island, West Virginia; Chicago Heights, Illinois and Elizabeth, New Jersey, as well as through independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe.  The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001.  However, the Copenhagen facility continues to be used for API research and development.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company believes it has an attractive pipeline of new products which it plans to introduce over the next several years.  One of the most potentially significant of these products is USHP''s generic form of Gabapentin.  Gabapentin, which was acquired through the Acquisition, is Purepac''s generic version of Neurontin, a drug used to treat epilepsy, which had 2001 brand sales close to $2.0 billion.  The Company believes Purepac was the first generic manufacturer to file a Paragraph IV certification challenging the patents protecting Neurontin.  As the first entity to file a Paragraph IV certification with respect to the primary continuing Gabapentin patents, the Company may benefit from generic market exclusivity for up to six months subject to receipt of all required FDA approvals and the satisfactory status of the brand company''s litigation challenge at the beginning of the exclusivity period.  The Company may not, in all circumstances, be able to control the commencement of the e
xclusivity period and therefore can give no assurance that it will benefit from being the first to file the Paragraph IV certification.  If the Company gains this exclusivity, based upon the results of similar generic product launches, the Company believes it can reasonably expect a significant initial market share (as much as 25-50% of the brand market) and such initial sales should also assist the Company in retaining a smaller but leading market share after the exclusivity period.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P>Government Regulation</P>
</B>
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;General.  </I>The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company''s human pharmaceutical and animal health products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other government agencies and by comparable authorities in the EU, Norway, Indonesia and other countries.  Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is a member of the European Economic Area and, as such, has accepted all EU regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals except in the area of feed antibiotics.  Government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can
 result in civil or criminal fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and distribution, the Company''s debarment or the debarment of individuals from obtaining new drug approvals or providing services to drug companies in any capacity, refusal of the government to approve new products or to purchase the Company''s products and criminal prosecution.  The cost of complying with government regulations substantially increases the cost of producing human pharmaceutical and animal health products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and analogous foreign agencies, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time the Company will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite the Company''s ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.  As a result of actions the Company has taken to respond to the progressively more demanding regulatory environment in which the Company operates, the Company has spent, and will continue to spend, significant funds and management time on regulatory compliance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Product Marketing Authority.  </I>In the U.S., the FDA regulatory procedure generally applicable to the Company''s human generic pharmaceutical products depends on whether the branded drug to which the generic version is equivalent or comparable is:</P>

<LI>the subject of an approved New Drug Application, or NDA, which has been reviewed for both safety and effectiveness;</LI>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If the drug to be offered is a generic variation of a branded product that is the subject of an NDA approved for both safety and effectiveness, the generic product must be the subject of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, and be approved by the FDA prior to marketing.  Drug products which are generic copies of the other types of branded products generally may be marketed in accordance with either FDA enforcement policies or the over-the-counter drug monograph program and generally are not subject to ANDA filings and approval prior to market introduction at this time.  While the Company believes that all of the Company''s current pharmaceutical products are appropriately marketed under the applicable FDA procedure or enforcement policy, the basis for marketing products not covered by approved ANDAs is subject to change or revocation by the FDA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;All applications for regulatory approval of generic drug products subject to ANDA requirements must contain data relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and quality control.

Like their human counterparts, pre-marketing approval under stringent FDA rules for their testing, development, and manufacture is required for animal drugs as well as for any changes in label claims, specifications or manufacturing sites that occur post-approval. The enormous backlog of submissions pending review in FDA''s Center for Veterinary Medicine has made the timing of such approvals difficult to predict.   Despite the difficulty a

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;An EU Directive requires that medical products must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the EU.  The criteria upon which grant of an authorization is assessed are quality, safety and efficacy.  Demonstration of safety and efficacy in particular requires clinical trials on human subjects and the conduct of such trials is subject to the standards codified in the EU guideline on Good Clinical Practice.  In addition, the EU requires that such trials be preceded by adequate pharmacological and toxicological tests in animals, that stability tests are also carried out and that clinical trials should use controls, be carried out double blind and capable of statistical analysis by using specific criteria wherever possible, rather than relying on a large sample size.  The working party on the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products has also made various recommendations in this area.  Analogous governmental and agency approvals are similarly required in othe

Consequently, continuing compliance with cGMP can be a particularly difficult and expensive part of regulatory compliance.  There are similar regulations in other countries where the Company has manufacturing operations.  The EU requires that before a medicinal product can be manufactured and assembled, each company who carries out such an operation must hold a manufacturer''s license, a product license must be held by the person responsible for the composition of the product, and the manufacture and assembly must be in accordance with

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;During 2001 the Company received inspection observations (483 Reports) from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Elizabeth and Baltimore and its Willow Island and Chicago Heights AHD plants.  The Elizabeth review resulted in the issuance of a warning letter and the inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation from the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMP.  The Company believes that it has taken action satisfactory to the FDA at its Elizabeth plant. As to each of the other plants, the inspections have been more recent and, as a result the Company is still in the process of discussing and implementing actions which it believes will be satisfactory to the FDA.  At the Baltimore plant, this action includes a temporary slowdown in production which will have an effect on earnings in the first quarter of 2002.    Additionally, the Company is presently engaging in a recall and other similar actions with respect to two of
 its USHP products.  In addition to the charges for these actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2001, further charges are expected in the first quarter of 2002.  There can be no assurance that the FDA will not require further actions at an additional cost. </P>

The Waxman-Hatch Act also provides patent extension and market exclusivity provisions for innovator drug manufacturers which preclude the submission or delay the approval of a competing ANDA under certain conditions.  One such provision allows a five year market exclusivity period for NDAs involving new chemical compounds and a three year market exclusivity period for NDAs or NDA supplements containing new clinical investigations essential to the approval of such application.  The market exclusivity provisions apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products.  Another provision authorizes the extension o

Patent terms may also be extended pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, or URAA.  In addition, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 allows patented brand name pharmaceuticals manufacturers to seek six months of additional exclusivity when they have conducted pediatric studies on the drug in accordance with the statute''s requirements.  Although the pediatric exclusivity provision in FDAMA expired </FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=2>on January 1, 2002, it was re-authorized by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was signed into law in January, 2002.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>Therefore, the Company cannot predict the extent to which the Waxman-Hatch Act, </FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=2>the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, </FONT><FONT FA

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In Europe, certain Directives confer a similar market exclusivity in respect of proprietary medicines, irrespective of any patent protection.  Before a generic manufacturer can present an abridged application for a marketing authorization, it must generally wait until the original proprietary drug has been on the market for a certain period, unless they have the consent of the person who submitted the original test data for the first marketing authorization, or can compile an adequate dossier of their own.  In the case of high technology products, the period is ten years or in some states for other medicinal products six years, subject to the option for Member States to elect for an exclusivity period of ten years with respect to all products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition to the exclusivity period, it is also possible in the EU to extend the period of patent protection for a product which has a marketing authorization by means of a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.  An SPC comes into force on the expiry of the relevant patent and lasts for a period calculated with reference to the delay between the filing of the patent and the granting of the first marketing authorization for the drug.  This period of protection, subject to a maximum of five years, further delays the marketing of generic medicinal products.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Controlled Substances Act.  </I>The Company also manufactures and sells drug products which are ""controlled substances"" as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, which establishes certain security and record keeping requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, a division of the Department of Justice.  The Company is licensed by the DEA to manufacture and distribute certain controlled substances.  The DEA has a dual mission: law enforcement and regulation.  The former deals with the illicit aspects of the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them.  The DEA shares enforcement authority with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another division of the Department of Justice.  The DEA''s regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed handlers of controlled substances, and with the substances themselves, equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to pre

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Health Care Reimbursement.  </I>The methods and level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products under Medicare, Medicaid, and other domestic reimbursement programs are the subject of constant review by state and federal governments and private third party payors like insurance companies.  The Company believes that U.S. government agencies will continue to review and assess alternative payment methodologies and reform measures designed to reduce the cost of drugs to the public.  As a part of this effort the federal government and several states have commenced administrative or court actions challenging the pricing practices of certain named drug manufacturers.  The Company is not a party to any of these actions.  Because the outcome of these and other health care reform initiatives is uncertain, the Company cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have on it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer''s selling price based on sales of outpatient drug products reimbursed under state Medicaid programs.  The required rebate rate for manufacturers of generic products is currently 11% of the average selling price for each product at the unit level, regardless of package size.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In many countries other than the U.S. in which the Company does business, the initial prices of pharmaceutical preparations for human use are dependent upon governmental approval or clearance under governmental reimbursement schemes.  These government programs generally establish prices by reference to either manufacturing costs or the prices of comparable products.  Subsequent price increases may also be regulated.  In past years, as part of overall programs to reduce health care costs, certain European governments have prohibited price increases and have introduced various systems designed to lower prices.  A review of proposed legislative changes to the UK generic pharmaceutical market is currently ongoing and as part of the review an interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the UK has been introduced.  Additionally, in Germany, new legislation was introduced in January, 2002 which adjusted the existing fixed price system, required a reduction o
f certain human generic pharmaceutical products.  See the sections ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management''s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"".  As a result, affected manufacturers, including the Company, have not always been able to recover cost increases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states in the EU regulate the pricing of such products and in some cases limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services.  These controls can result in considerable price differences between member states.  There is also a Common External Tariff payable on import of medicinal products into the EU, though exemptions are available in respect of certain products which allow duty free importation.  Where there is no tariff suspension in operation in respect of a medicinal product, an application can be made to import the product duty free, but this is subject to review at the European level to establish whether a member state would be able to produce the product in question instead.  In addition, some products are subject to a governmental quota which restricts the amount which can be imported duty free.</P>

A full investigation of the matter with the assistance of legal counsel and the Company''s independent auditors was initiated and completed.   During the third quarter of 2000, the Company revised all affected periods, comprising all four quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2000.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations.  The Company is presently responding to regulatory observations as a result of these reviews. Failure to adequately address these concerns could have a material adverse effect on the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2001 the Company received inspection observations (483 Reports) from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Elizabeth and Baltimore and its Willow Island and Chicago Heights AHD plants.  The Elizabeth review resulted in the issuance of a warning letter and the inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation from the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMP.  The Company believes that it has taken action satisfactory to the FDA at its Elizabeth plant. As to each of the other plants, the inspections have been more recent and, as a result the Company is still in the process of discussing and implementing actions which it believes will be satisfactory to the FDA.  At the Baltimore plant, this action includes a temporary slowdown in production which will have an effect on earnings in the first quarter of 2002.    Additionally, the Company is presently engaging in recalls with respect to two of its USHP products.  In additio

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company also has affiliations, license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory approvals sought by such third parties. The Company''s vendors and third party contract manufacturers are subject to these same regulatory restrictions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company has filed, and continues to file, applications to market its products with the FDA and other regulatory agencies both in the U.S. and internationally.  The timing of receipt of approvals of these applications can significantly affect the Company''s future revenues and income.  This is particularly significant with respect to human pharmaceuticals where the Company is, in certain instances, using procedures, known as ""paragraph IV certification,"" to seek marketing approvals prior to the latest date as to which a third party may claim patent protection, including, among others, with respect to Gabapentin.  The use of this strategy may involve lengthy litigation, frequently with substantially larger, well-financed pharmaceutical companies.  There can be no assurance that the Company will obtain new product approvals in a timely manner, if ever, through litigation or otherwise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food producing animals.  While most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that the Company offers for sale, effective July&nbsp;1, 1999, the European Union and five non-EU countries have banned the use of bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic and growth promoter manufactured by the Company and others which has been used in livestock feeds for over 40 years.  The EU ban is based upon the ""Precautionary Principle"" which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by scientific certainty.  The Company''s initial effort to reverse this action by means of a cou
rt injunction from the Court of First Instance of the European Court was denied.  The Company is continuing to pursue the Company''s efforts in the European Court and based upon what it believes to be highly persuasive scientific evidence with respect to the product the Company is engaged in certain other initiatives to limit the effects of this ban.  Although the EU actions negatively impact the Company''s business, they were not material to the Company''s financial position or its results of operations.   The discussions concerning resistance to antibiotics used in certain food producing animals have recently become more active in the U.S.  Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse effects of the use of antibiotics in food animals.  Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company''s customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics.  It is uncertain what actions, if any, the FDA may take in connection with 
drug resistant bacteria in animal health products.  The loss of the U.S. market for, or negative publicity regarding, the Company''s bacitracin-based products would be materially adverse to the Company.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban will be expanded.  If either (a)&nbsp;the EU or countries or customers within the EU, act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based products, or (b)&nbsp;there is an expansion of the ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products or (c) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the Company''s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company''s generic pharmaceuticals business has historically been subject to intense competition.  As patents and other bases for market exclusivity expire, prices typically decline as generic competitors, such as the Company, enter the marketplace.  Normally, there is a further unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increases.  The timing of these price decreases is unpredictable and can result in a significantly curtailed period of profitability for a generic product.  In addition, brand-name and patented pharmaceuticals manufacturers frequently take actions to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalents.  These actions may include:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>filing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>developing patented controlled-release products or other product improvements; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>increasing marketing initiatives and filing of additional litigation.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic pharmaceuticals market conditions, particularly, in the U.S., were further affected in recent years by a fundamental shift in industry distribution, purchasing and stocking patterns resulting from increased importance of sales to major wholesalers and a concurrent reduction in sales to private label generic distributors.  Wholesaler programs generally require lower prices on products sold, lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesaler''s own marketing programs.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The factors which have adversely affected the U.S. generic pharmaceuticals industry may also affect some or all of the markets in which the Company operates internationally.  In addition, in Europe the Company is encountering price pressure from parallel imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws of free movement of goods.  Parallel imports could lead to lower revenue for the Company.  The Company''s international pharmaceuticals business is also affected by general governmental initiatives to reduce drug prices, including price controls or other restrictions on the Company''s industry.  Parallel imports, governmental cost containment and other regulatory efforts could cause lower prices in certain markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany and the Nordic countries, where the Company has significant sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In all the Company''s businesses, it may become more difficult for the Company to respond to competitive challenges because of the significance of relatively few major customers, such as large wholesalers, animal producers and chain stores, a rapidly changing market and uncertainty of timing of new product approvals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The bulk antibiotic, international generic human pharmaceutical and animal pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and many of the Company''s competitors in these areas are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company possesses.  The increased focus on pharmaceutical prices in Europe may lead to increased competition and price pressures for suppliers of all types of pharmaceuticals, including generics.  In addition, in certain countries such as France, because of the Company''s size and product mix, the Company may not be able to capitalize on such changes in competition and pricing as fully as the Company''s competitors.  </P>

Third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services and their reimbursement practices may prevent the Company from maintaining the Company''s present product price levels.  In addition, the market for the Company''s products may be limited by third party payors who establish lists of approved products and do not provide reimbursement for products not listed.  Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer''s selling price on sales of certain prescription drugs reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company seeks to obtain liability insurance to protect it from liability due to accidents, product liability and other claims which arise during the course of doing business.  The insurance that the Company obtains to protect itself against these potential liabilities may be inadequate, or such insurance may be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive.  The Company must renew some of its insurance policies each year.  In recent months the Company has experienced significant increases in its insurance costs.  In addition, the Company''s insurance policies may contain exceptions which do not protect it from liabilities it may incur due to products it now manufactures or may manufacture in the future.  The Company''s inability to obtain and maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms could materially adversely affect the Company''s business, financial condition and results of operations.  </P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company recently announced new management of its Animal Health business and immediately began exploring changes in market strategy in this business.  The clear objectives of any new strategy will include strengthening customer and market focus, stabilizing pricing, and significantly improving working capital management.  As a first step, the Company has reduced the use of certain U.S. sales incentives in this division.  These incentives had the effect of increasing the Company''s level of accounts receivable.  In addition to previously announced charges in the fourth quarter of 2001, these evolving strategies could require future actions necessitating charges against income including divestitures, decisions to curtail or terminate activities with respect to the development of certain products in its pipeline, the necessity to alter or terminate certain existing contractual arrangements and organizational restructuring. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>The Company has filed a Paragraph IV certification challenging the patents protecting Pfizer''s Gabapentin, a drug used to treat epilepsy.  While not assured, this filing could provide the Company with generic market exclusivity for a period of up to six months.  Given the size of the Gabapentin market (close to $2.0 billion in 2001) and the market price and share normally anticipated during a period of generic exclusivity, the Company''s profit potential (which it is initially obligated to share equally with its supplier of the drug''s active ingredient) could be significant.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Pfizer has filed several lawsuits challenging the Company''s position that it can introduce the product prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the Pfizer patents.  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the Company may be able to commence the sale of the product in December of 2002 whether or not the Pfizer litigation has been finally decided.  The Company could also wait to commence sales until the receipt of a court decision or any appeal.  While the Company has made no decision on this issue, a launch at anytime before a final decision on Pfizer claims would leave the Company exposed to potential material infringement damages if Pfizer were to ultimately prevail in the litigation.  In addition, in order to be prepared to take advantage of the six month period of exclusivity, the Company would be required to produce significant amounts of inventory during 2002.  In the event that Pfizer prevails in the litigation, or the Company decides to delay its launch to a date significantly
 after December 2002, this inventory may no longer be commercially saleable which would result in a write-off and a charge against the Company''s income in the relevant period. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition, the Company may incur additional debt.  Subject to specified limitations, the agreement governing the notes and the Company''s senior credit facilities permit the Company and its subsidiary guarantors to incur substantial additional debt. </P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company''s ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt depends on the Company''s ability to generate cash flow.  This, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company''s control.  In addition, the Company''s ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on its satisfaction of the financial covenants in the issuer''s senior credit facilities and other debt agreements..  The Company''s business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to the Company under its senior credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or fund other liquidity needs.    If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash, it may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity.  The Company may
 not be able to refinance any of its debt on favorable terms, or at all.  Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance the Company''s debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.</P>

For example, the Company''s senior credit facilities require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with each of these ratios and the net worth test, and the de-leveraging activities summarized below will assist the Company in its future compliance.   However, events beyond its control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect its ability to satisfy these covenants.  The Company might not meet these covenants, and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet these covenants.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the Company''s senior credit facilities and under the agreement governing the notes.  If an event of default under the Company''s senior credit facilities occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.  The Company''s senior credit facilities are also subject to early maturity and termination in certain cases.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To better assure the Company''s continued debt covenant compliance, it has implemented a strategy to de-leverage its balance sheet.  Pursuant to this strategy, the Company has undertaken a series of initiatives which includes aggressive expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets.  The Company may also issue additional common stock for cash or in exchange for existing convertible debt.  Additionally, in December, 2001, the Company repaid  $65.0 million of the term loans under its senior credit facilities and completed the exchange of its Class A common stock for a portion of its 5.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 having an approximate principal value of $34.1 million. In March, 2002, the Company completed additional exchanges of its Class A common stock for a portion of its 5.75% Notes having an approximate principal value of $56.6 million and for a portion of its 3.0% convertible subordinated notes due 2006 having an approximate principal

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P>Item 3. Legal Proceedings</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  This class action has been brought on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company''s securities between April 28, 1999 and October 30, 2000.  The Company is named as a defendant along with one of its board members, two of its current officers and one of its former officers.  The class action complaint alleges that, among other things, the plaintiffs were damaged when they acquired the Company''s securities because, as a result of (1) alleged irregularities in the Company''s animal health business in Brazil, (2) allegedly improper revenue recognition practices and (3) the October 2000 revision of its financial results for 1999 and 2000, the Company''s previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company''s securities.  The complaint alleges violations 
of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint on legal grounds, and discovery is stayed pending the determination of that motion.  Based on the Company''s preliminary investigation, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses which it intends to vigorously assert against the class action.  Additionally, the Company has filed a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the named individual defendants under its directors'' and officers'' insurance policies and believes that insurance coverage exists to the extent of the policy limits for the costs incurred in defending the claims and any adverse judgment or settlement, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the relevant insurance policy.  Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class action will result in liability which will be material to the
 Company''s financial position.  However, because of the early stage of this matter, it is not possible for the Company to conclude that resolution of the lawsuit will not be material to the Company''s financial position or its results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or year in which it occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;On August 11, 2000, the Company was named as one of multiple defendants filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona by Lemelson Medical, Education &amp; Research Foundation, Limited Partnership, or the Lemelson Partnership, alleging infringement of certain patents in the area of electronic reading devices transferred to the Lemelson Partnership by the late Jerome H.  Lemelson.  The suit seeks compensatory damages to compensate the Lemelson Partnership for past infringement and further alleges that the Company''s infringement is willful and that damages should be trebled.  The Company has counterclaimed that, amongst other things, the Lemelson Partnership patents are invalid, unenforceable or have not been infringed by the Company.  While the Company has not completed its analysis of either the validity or applicability of these patents, several of its material manufacturing facilities do use devices and machinery within the general technical area covered by th
ese third party patents.  In January 2001, the Court ordered a stay pending another ongoing case. </P>

After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under Paragraph IV that the Company''s proposed <A NAME="_DV_M34"></A>Gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not <A NAME="_DV_C33">infringe<A NAME="_DV_M35"></A></A> this patent and <A NAME="_DV_C34">this patent is invalid or unenforceable.  </A>In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this patent. <A NAME="_DV_M37"></A> <A NAME="_DV_M40"></A>The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent.  <A NAME="_DV_M42"></A>This motion is under consideration by the Court and
 has not yet been ruled on.  <A NAME="_DV_M43"></A>Fact discovery has closed and expert discovery is scheduled to close in March 2002.  No trial date has been set.  Unless and until the Company decides to market its Gabapentin tablets or capsules, the Company would, at most,<A NAME="_DV_M44"></A> <A NAME="_DV_M45"></A>only be liable to Pfizer for its legal costs and not any <A NAME="_DV_C40">monetary<A NAME="_DV_M46"></A></A> damages.  To date, the Company has not marketed these pharmaceuticals. There is the possibility that as a result of <A NAME="_DV_M47"></A>this litigation the Company could be prevented from marke<A NAME="_DV_C43">ting the Company''s Gabapentin capsules or<A NAME="_DV_M48"></A></A> tablets until Pfizer''s <A NAME="_DV_C44">patents expire.<A NAME="_DV_M49"><A NAME="_DV_M50"></A></A></A></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in 2001 the Company initiated reorganization, refocus and other actions of approximately $27.0 million intended to improve future operations of its operating segments and in the fourth quarter initiated a deleveraging program to reduce its debt.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>2001</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in process research and development.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OPB acquisition was ultimately funded by a $900.0 million Bank Credit Agreement ("2001 Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks and a $200.0 million senior subordinated note. Proceeds from the 2001 Credit Agreement were used to repay the prior Bank Credit Agreement. Bridge financing and other bank fees and the repayment of the prior Bank Credit Agreement resulted in additional expenses in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent with the OPB Acquisition the Company's USPD was combined with the U.S. operations of OPB to form the U.S. Human Pharmaceutical Segment. The combination resulted in approximately $4.8 million in severance charges in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, the Company announced the creation of the HPI to be comprised of IPD, FCD and OPB-China. The combination resulted in charges of approximately $4.3 million primarily for severance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, the Company's Animal Health Segment announced changes in business practices and a change in existing management. These changes resulted in severance of approximately $1.1 million, charges relating to the exiting of a product line of $10.2 million, and lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December, the Company exchanged $34.1 million of outstanding subordinated debentures into approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock and recorded a non cash expense of $7.4 million. Additionally, the Company repaid term loans of $65.0 million and recorded an extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt ($1.5 million pre-tax, $.9 million after tax).</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May, the Company's AHD purchased the Medicated Feed Additive Business of Roche Ltd. ("MFA") for a cash payment of $258.0 million and the issuance of a $30.0 million promissory note to Roche. The acquisition was initially financed under a $225.0 million bridge financing agreement ("Bridge Financing") and existing credit agreements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May, the Company sold 4.95 million shares of Class A common stock and received proceeds of approximately $185.6 million which were used to repay a portion of the Bridge Financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June, the Company signed an amendment to its 1999 Credit Facility and increased the facility by $100.0 million to $400.0 million. Upon the completion of the amendment the Company borrowed the necessary funds and repaid and terminated the Bridge Financing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, the Company sold 5.0 million shares of Class A Common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $287.3 million.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, the Company's  AHD contributed the distribution business of its Wade Jones subsidiary into a joint venture with two similar third-party distribution businesses. The new entity, WYNCO, which is a regional distributor of animal health products in the Central South West and Eastern regions of the U.S., is 50% owned by the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, the Company replaced its revolving credit facility and existing domestic short-term credit lines with a $300.0 million syndicated facility ("1999 Credit Facility") which provided for increased borrowing capacity.</P>

Charges, net after tax, were approximately $4.0 million.</P>

<P>A discussion of each of these 2001 identified transactions follows.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>OPB Acquisition</P>
</B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</U>OPB Financing</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2001, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the OPB of Faulding Limited from Mayne Nickless Limited ("Mayne") subject to Mayne's completion of a tender offer for Faulding. The Company was required to make a $145.0 million escrow deposit in July. In October the Company obtained management control of OPB, subject to certain limitations. In October to fund the $660.0 million purchase price to Mayne the Company released the $145.0 million escrow, paid an additional $255.0 million and provided a $260.0 million letter of credit. In December the acquisition closed and the letter of credit was funded. The OPB is included in the Company's results from December 12, 2001, the date of acquisition. The identified transactions include the interest expense and letter of credit fees related to the prepayments during the July-December period of $8.4 million and a charge of $2.3 million included in other, net for bank fees primarily for the bridge financing net of 
interest income on the escrow deposit.</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new financing required for the OPB resulted in the repayment and termination of the 1999 Credit Facility. The write off of the bank fees related to the early extinguishment of debt ($2.2 million pre-tax, $1.3 million net of tax) are also included with the identified transactions.</P>
<U>
</U><P>Purchase Accounting</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.8 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.3 million will be expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write off of in-process research and development ("IPR&amp;D"). IPR&amp;D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&amp;D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&amp;D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduc
ed for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Combination of OPB with USPD and Other Acquisition Expenses</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon acquisition, the OPB was combined with the USPD to create U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals. The combination resulted in severance of $4.8 million related to USPD employees. In addition, the IPD commenced the closure of its Copenhagen Research Facility resulting in severance of approximately $1.5 million. The Company intends to conduct its oral solid research at the OPB facilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2001 the Company incurred acquisition expenses for professional and consulting services of $3.2 million related to the OPB.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the transactions identified with the OPB acquisition resulted in a net loss of $52.4 million or $1.28 per share.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Deleveraging Activities</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company significantly increased its debt in connection with the OPB acquisition. The credit facilities entered into in connection with the acquisition of OPB and the refinancing of existing debt contain various financial covenants, operating restrictions and require the repayment of debt on a scheduled basis. The Company is in compliance with all of the terms of the credit facilities and believes it will be able to comply in the future. In order to ensure continued compliance and increase flexibility under the agreements, the Company intends to deleverage at an accelerated pace. Toward this goal, the Company has adopted a comprehensive deleveraging plan, which includes aggressive expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets. The Company will continue to pursue other alternatives to further reduce debt.  (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for 2002 deleveraging activities).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, the Company exchanged $34.1 million of 5.75% subordinated debentures for approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock and recorded a non-cash expense of $7.4 million. Additionally, in December 2001, the Company repaid term loans of $65.0 million and recorded an extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt ($1.5 million pre-tax, $.9 million after tax). The sum of the 2001 deleveraging activities resulted in a loss of approximately $6.8 million ($.17 per share).</P>

Animal Health</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2001 the Company changed management in its Animal Health business. The change in management resulted in severance charges of $1.1 million. New management began a review of current projects and decided to discontinue support of certain projects including the commercialization of the optibreed product. This decision resulted in a charge for disposal of optibreed inventory of $8.7 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
HPI</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of IPD and FCD resulted in severance charges of $2.8 million. </P>

Other Items</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other identified transactions which net to $.4 million expense include income of $2.1 million from the settlement of vitamin litigation in the second quarter of 2001 offset by the write off of investments of $2.5 million including an equity position in the company which manufactured the optibreed product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of the reorganization, refocus and other transactions is a loss of $7.9 million ($.19 per share).</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IPD decreased $46.4 million (15.0%) due to lower volume in many of our markets including Germany and the U.K., lower pricing primarily in the UK and Germany and the effects of translation of currencies into the US dollar. The UK market in 2000 had higher prices due to market conditions. These favorable market conditions did not exist in 2001 due to interim market pricing legislation adopted in August of 2000 that had the effect of lowering pricing. In addition, UK competition has increased primarily on higher margin products which has also lowered prices and margins. The interim price regulations are presently being reviewed. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, the present government review of pricing and other aspects of the generic drug market will have on future UK pricing or market conditions.  In 2002 new legislation was introduced in Germany which will have the effect of lowering pricing.  The Company is unable to predict the long-term impact these 
circumstances will have on the Company's German operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals in Germany. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FCD revenues increased $11.7 million (18.7%) due primarily to increased volume. USHP revenues increased $73.4 million (31.5%) due to increased volume in new and existing products offset in part by lower net pricing. The acquisition of the OPB - US in December 2001 increased revenues by approximately $15.1 million. In connection with the OPB acquisition, the Company noted that certain of OPB's wholesale customers have levels of inventory generally higher than the Company has historically experienced at USPD. OPB management has indicated that these inventory levels are consistent with OPB's historical experience. However, in the event that these customers reduce inventory levels in the future, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal Health revenues increased $34.4 million (11.4%) due to the timing of the MFA acquisition in May 2000 (i.e. seven months in 2000 versus twelve months in 2001). Offsetting increases due to acquisition timing were lower sales in the second half of 2001 versus 2000 due to a change in marketing strategy which reduced certain sales incentives and extended terms. Also impacting sales in Animal Health are unfavorable conditions in the U.S. Poultry market, a fire at an important Company shipping location and difficult economic conditions in Asia.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Gross Profit</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Company-wide basis gross profit declined $19.4 million as reported and excluding identified transactions decreased $8.9 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profit in 2001 as reported was 39.1%, compared to 40.2% excluding identified transactions and 44.5% in 2000. The reduction in gross margin excluding identified transactions represents lower pricing, lower volume and related production inefficiencies as well as F/X effects in IPD offset partially by increases in USPD and FCD due to volume and relatively flat gross profits in AHD. USPD gross profits were negatively impacted by two product recalls which lowered gross profit by approximately $10.0 million in 2001.  AHD gross profits were negatively effected in 2000 by the $1.0 million write up and subsequent write off of MFA manufactured inventory.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, in accordance with GAAP the Company reported an extraordinary item due to the early extinguishment of debt.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December 31, 2000 revenue was $900.8 million, an increase of $184.8 million (25.8%) compared to 1999. Operating income was $124.3 million, an increase of $40.4 million, compared to 1999. Net income was $55.5 million ($1.49 per share) compared to a net income $30.0 million ($1.07 per share) in 1999. Results for 2000 include non-recurring charges resulting from the MFA acquisition which reduced net income by $4.0 million ($.09 per share).</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Acquisition Program<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of MFA, the 1999 acquisitions by IPD and AHD, and the financing required to complete the acquisitions affect most comparisons of 2000 results to 1999. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has integrated the operations of the 1999 acquisitions and MFA within the respective divisional operations. The MFA acquisition has been integrated to a greater extent because its assets, operations and personnel were immediately absorbed in existing AHD legal entities. As a result the full incremental impact of the acquisitions is impractical to segregate. The Company estimates acquisitions contributed revenues of approximately $180.0 million, in the year ended December 31, 2000.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Revenues<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues increased in the Human Pharmaceuticals business by $43.6 million and in the Animal Pharmaceuticals business by $141.8 million. The aggregate increase in revenues was reduced by approximately $34.0 million due to changes in exchange rates used in translating sales in foreign currencies into the U.S. Dollar, primarily in IPD.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in revenue and major components of change for each division in the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to December 31, 1999 are as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IPD increased by $6.0 million due primarily to the 1999 acquisitions (approximately $33.0 million) and to a lesser extent higher pricing in the U.K. The increases were offset substantially by effects of currency translation ($30.0 million) and lower volume in certain markets. The pricing in the U.K. market was higher relative to the first half of 1999, but was lower in the second half of 2000 compared to the second half of 1999. U.K. revenues grew in 1999 primarily as a result of higher pricing due in large part to unusual conditions affecting the market which abated during the second quarter of 2000. Effective August 3, 2000 the U.K. government has adopted interim maximum pricing legislation. The government has indicated that it will review the interim legislation within the next 12 to 15 months. Market conditions resulted in certain lower prices commencing in the second quarter of 2000 and further reductions as a result of the adoption of the above noted legislatio
n have occurred in the second half of 2000 and are expected to continue in 2001.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Pharmaceutical ("USPD") revenues increased $35.7 million due to volume increases in new and existing products offset in part by lower net pricing. Revenues in FCD increased by $1.9 million due mainly to volume increases being partially offset by translation of sales in local currency into the U.S. Dollar.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AHD revenues increased $144.0 million due to acquisitions primarily MFA ($142.0 million). Offsetting acquisition increases, adverse market and competitive conditions in a number of AHD's main markets caused volume declines and to a lesser extent price reductions in certain ongoing products. AAHD revenues declined due mainly to adverse market conditions and increased competition.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>Gross Profit<BR>
</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a consolidated basis, gross profit increased to $72.1 million and the gross margin percent decreased to 44.5% in 2000 compared to 45.9 % in 1999.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major portion of the dollar increase results from the acquisitions (primarily MFA and Isis). Higher pricing in the IPD's United Kingdom market and volume increases of a number of products in USPD also contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting dollar increases were volume decreases in AHD non-MFA products and certain IPD markets, lower net pricing in USPD and the effects of foreign currency translation. In addition in the fourth quarter of 2000, the FDA made a pharmaceutical industry-wide request that sale of products containing Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) be discontinued. The Company voluntarily complied with this request and as a result, reduced gross profit by approximately $2.5 million for write-downs of inventory on hand and anticipated product returns. The gross profit percent declined mainly due to the products included in the MFA acquisition which have lower gross profit percents than base animal health products.</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, AHD gross profits were reduced by a $1.0 million write-up and subsequent write-off upon sale of MFA manufactured inventory. The write-up was required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Operating Expenses</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenses increased $31.7 million and represented 30.7% of revenues in 2000 compared to 34.2% in 1999. The dollar increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions including amortization of related intangibles (primarily MFA and Isis). Other increases included professional and consulting expenses for strategic planning, information technology and acquisitions, and a $.4 million charge for severance of existing AHD employees resulting from the combining of the sales forces of MFA and AHD. Foreign currency translation reduced the dollar amount of the increase by approximately $14.2 million. The percentage reduction is the result of leveraging of incremental MFA sales on the existing AHD business infrastructure.</P>

<FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AHD's $53.7 million net margin improvement is due primarily to the MFA acquisition offset by weakness in base product sales in a number of markets. (due to integration of the MFA business into AHD, a segregation of operating income is not practicable). The increase in operating expense for all divisions is adjusted for the estimated impact of foreign currency translation.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Interest Expense/Other/Taxes<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense increased in 2000 by $6.0 million due primarily to debt incurred to finance the acquisitions and to a lesser extent, higher interest rates in 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other, net was $3.4 million expense in 2000, due primarily to $4.7 million fees incurred as part of the $225.0 million MFA bridge financing and other financing fees. The bridge financing was committed, drawn, repaid and terminated in the second quarter. All fees associated with the interim financing were expensed in the second quarter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year-to-date effective tax rate was 26.7% in 2000 compared to 35.1% in 1999. The primary reason for the lower rate is the acquisition of foreign businesses in recent years and the related restructuring of ownership of legal entities in 2000 which provided a one-time benefit of $2.5 million in 2000 and will allow for movement of funds between the international entities.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Inflation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of inflation on the Company's operations during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was not significant.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. All professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 2001, have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  The Company has chosen to highlight certain policies that it considers critical to the operations of the business and understanding its consolidated financial statements:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Revenue recognition</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.   Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
In the Company's US Human Pharmaceutical business, and to a lesser extent in Human Pharmceuticals - International, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, or other managed-care reserves. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. The Company estimates these rebates, chargebacks, managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience. The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has completed several acquisitions since 1998, which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization.   The values assigned to goodwill and intangibles, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgement and estimation by the Company.  In addition, upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company will be required to cease amortization of goodwill and review goodwill annually for impairment.     </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations. These allocations, including an assessment of estimated useful lives, have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies. Valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset, including historical cash flows.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Asset Impairments</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a dimunition in value may have occurred, based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset. If the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgements and estimates by the Company, including the determination of an event indicating impairment; the future cash flows to be generated by the asset, including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action; the risk associated with those cash flows; and the Company's cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Research and Development ("R&amp;D"), Including In-Process R&amp;D ("IPR&amp;D")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
With respect to completed acquisitions, acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility, signified by FDA or comparable regulatory body approval, are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits.   Estimates of the values  of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&amp;D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Inventories</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for most inventories, with certain US Human Pharmaceutical inventory values on a last-in, first-out basis. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Reserves are recorded for inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation.   The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Litigation and Contingencies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and also to certain other contingencies (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 16 to the financial statements).  The Company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred.   Additionally, the Company assesses, in consultation with its counsel, the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis.   Reserves are recorded when the Company, in consultation with counsel, determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Income Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.   The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset.   In the event the Company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is recorded.   The Company's valuation allowance principally relates to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income.</P>

Liquidity and Capital Resources<BR>
</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2001, stockholders' equity was $891.6 million compared to $847.9 million and $343.5 million at December&nbsp;31, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  The ratio of long-term debt to equity was 1.16:1, .59:1, and 1.72:1 at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in stockholder' equity in 2001 mainly represents the exchanges of convertible debentures to equity and other equity issuances totaling $113.2 million offset by a net loss of $37.9 million, a negative currency translation adjustment of $24.1 million and dividends of $7.5 million. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2000 primarily reflects the issuance of common stock in 2000 resulting from the $472.8 million equity offerings and net income partially offset by the currency translation adjustment. The increase in long-term debt in 1999 was due primarily to the acquisitions. In 2000 senior debt was paid down with a portion of the proceeds from the equity offerings. 
In 2001 long term debt increased to finance the OPB acquisition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital at December 31, 2001 was $319.0 million compared to $394.0 million and $209.2 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The current ratio was 1.93:1 at December&nbsp;31, 2001 compared to 2.91:1 and 2.27:1 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance sheet amounts at year end 2001 compared to 2000 are affected by the OPB acquisition which increased amounts and foreign exchange that reduced amounts reported in U.S. dollars. The OPB acquisition increased the balance sheet captions by the following approximate amounts: accounts receivable ($44.9 million), inventory ($59.8 million), property plant and equipment ($111.3 million), intangible assets ($557.1 million), accounts payable ($87.6 million) and non current deferred taxes ($68.4 million).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flow from operations in 2001 was $119.4 million compared to $33.1 million and $71.6 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 2001 cash flow benefited from the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&amp;D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. Additionally, the Company reduced accounts receivable balances compared to 2000 by $26.6 million. The change in marketing strategy in AH in the 4<SUP>th</SUP> quarter of 2001 is the main reason for this decline. Cash flow from operations in 2000 was negatively impacted by the structure of the MFA acquisition. The MFA acquisition did not include existing MFA accounts receivable and accordingly, the increase in accounts receivable as sales were made is reflected as reduction in operating cash flow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance sheet amounts decreased as of December 31, 2001 compared to December 2000 in U.S. Dollars as the functional currencies of the Company's principal foreign subsidiaries, the Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone, the Euro, and British Pound, depreciated versus the U.S. Dollar in 2001 by approximately 1%, 3%, 3% and 1%, respectively. These decreases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios. The approximate decrease due to currency translation of selected captions was: accounts receivable $4.0 million, inventories $4.9 million, accounts payable and accrued expenses $2.1 million, and total stockholder's equity $24.1 million. The $24.1 million decrease in stockholder's equity represents other comprehensive loss for the year and results from the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in 2001 against all major functional currencies of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the Company's capital expenditures including expenditures for a Company wide ERP system were $85.3 million, and in 2002 the Company plans to spend approximately the same amount. The Company has approved a number of capital projects including the construction of a AHD plant for Lasalocid, and a company-wide information technology project which is expected to require additional capital expenditures of approximately $35.0 million through 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1999, the Company acquired a technology license and option agreement for the animal health product, REPORCIN. The agreement requires additional payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets. Total additional payments at December 31, 2001 of approximately $32.0 million are required over the next 5 years if all 7 possible country approvals are received. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin. To meet that requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June 2000 and began to prepare the facility for production of Reporcin. Due to a reassessment of the Company's approach to the US market, the facility, on which the Company has expended $12 million, was not complete at December 31, 2001. While the Company continues to pursue regulatory approval for Reporcin in the US, this reassessment has re
sulted in changes to or delays in planned activities related to the completion of the Terre Haute facility. However, the Company has reviewed the facility for impairment and determined, based on present facts and circumstances, no write-down of the facility is required at December 31, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2001, the Company had $14.9 million in cash, available short term lines of credit of approximately $38.0 million and $300.0 million available under its 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the Company's short-term and long-term debt is at variable interest rates. The 2001 Credit Facility requires the Company enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on 50% of its debt. In early 2002, the Company entered into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for $60.0 million of its variable debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates. The Company's policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001 the Company completed the acquisition of the OPB (See Note 3) and entered into a $900.0 million credit agreement ("Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement. The Credit Facility includes restrictive covenants, and the most restrictive of these covenants is the total leverage ratio, which is total debt (as defined) divided by EBITDA (as defined).   This requires the calculation of EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis and pro-forma for the acquisition of the OPB.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2001.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued compliance with these covenants in 2002 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA, and therefore the Company's ability to generate operating income, and also on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt. The Company has undertaken certain actions in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt as part of an overall deleveraging plan. Under this plan, the Company in December 2001 repaid term debt of $65.0 million and exchanged common shares for $34.1 million of convertible subordinated debt.  Additionally, in the first quarter of 2002, the Company exchanged common shares for approximately $109.5 million of convertible subordinated debt.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above actions, combined with expected improvement in operating profit in 2002 relative to 2001, the Company fully expects to comply with these covenants throughout 2002.  Additionally, the Company believes it has the ability to further reduce operating or capital expenditures, and sufficient access to capital such that debt could be further reduced, if these actions become necessary to comply with the covenants.</P>

<B>Derivative Financial Instruments-Market Risk and Risk Management Policies</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company's risk management practice includes the selective use, on a limited basis, of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements. Such instruments are used for purposes other than trading.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in U.S. Dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies. The Company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations. The Company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2001 the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $46.9 million. The fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material. All contracts expire in the first three quarters of 2002. The cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non-functional currency transactions. The change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than $.5 million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable. Such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2001 the Company has no interest rate agreements outstanding. In early 2002 the Company entered into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for $60.0 million of its variable rate debt.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141) and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), SFAS 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and requires these business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS 142 applies to all goodwill and intangibles acquired in a business combination. Under SFAS 142, all goodwill, including goodwill acquired before initial application of the standard, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of the statement, and at least annually thereafter. Intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has adopted SFAS 141 for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of the Oral Pharmaceuticals Business of FH Faulding ("OPB") (see Note 3), and will adopt SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company is presently evaluating the potential impact of these standards on its financial position and results of operations. However, due to the OPB acquisition and the number of acquisitions completed by the Company in previous years, the adoption of these statements could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, amortization related to goodwill was approximately $18,500.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company is currently evaluating the effects the new rules may have on its financial statements and expects to adopt SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the new rules continue previous guidance to recognize impairment when the undiscounted cash flows will not recover its carrying amount. The impairment to be recognized will continue to be measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The computation of fair value now removes goodwill from consideration.  Assets that are to be disposed of by sale have adopted the same measurement approach as for those assets to be held and used. Additionally, assets qualifying for discontinued operations treatment have been expanded beyond the former operating segment approach. Long-lived assets to be disposed by other than sale will 
now recognize impairment at the date of disposal, but will be considered assets to be held and used until that time. The Company is currently evaluating the effects the new rules may have on its financial statements and has adopted SFAS 144 as of January 1, 2002.</P>

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is 
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</P>

<P>In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index on page F-1 of this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alpharma Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company" ) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evid
ence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.<BR>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma Inc. and Subsidiaries, (the "Company") is a multinational pharmaceutical company which develops, manufactures and markets specialty generic and proprietary human pharmaceutical and animal pharmaceutical products.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the Company acquired the pharmaceutical, animal health, bulk antibiotic and aquatic animal health business ("Alpharma Oslo") of A.L. Industrier A.S ("A.L. Industrier"), the beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B Stock. The Class B stock represents 26.8% of the total outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2001. A.L. Industrier, a Norwegian company, is able to control the Company through its ability to elect more than a majority of the Board of Directors and to cast a majority of the votes in any non-class vote of the Company's stockholders. (See Note 18.)</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2000 and prior years, the Company was organized on a global basis within its Human Pharmaceutical and Animal Pharmaceutical businesses into five decentralized divisions each of which had a president and operated in a distinct business and/or geographic area. In January 2001, the Company combined the Aquatic Animal Health Division with its Animal Health Division.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through September 2001, the Human Pharmaceutical business included: the U.S. Pharmaceuticals Division ("USPD"), the International Pharmaceuticals Division ("IPD") and the Fine Chemicals Division ("FCD"). The USPD's principal products are generic liquid and topical pharmaceuticals sold primarily to wholesalers, distributors and merchandising chains. The IPD's principal products are dosage form pharmaceuticals sold primarily in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and western Europe as well as Indonesia and certain middle eastern countries. The FCD's principal products are bulk pharmaceutical antibiotics sold to the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and worldwide for use as active substances in a number of finished pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2001, the Company announced the creation of Human Pharmaceuticals International ("HPI") to be composed of IPD, FCD and the Chinese operations of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals. In October 2001, the Company announced the creation of U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP") to be composed of USPD and the U.S. operations of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals. Each business will be managed by a single management team. The results of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals ("OPB") will be included from the date of acquisition December 12, 2001. The OPB manufactures and sells generic and proprietary solid dose oral pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and China. The Company's intention is to ultimately combine HPI and USHP in an integrated global human pharmaceutical business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Animal Pharmaceutical business is managed by a single management team and includes the Animal Health Division ("AHD") and the Aquatic Animal Health Division ("AAHD"). The AHD's principal products are feed additive and other animal health products for animals raised for commercial food production (principally poultry, cattle and swine) in the U.S. and worldwide. The AAHD manufactures and markets vaccines primarily for use in immunizing farmed fish (principally salmon) worldwide with a concentration in Norway. (See Note 22 for segment and geographic information.)</P>

Principles of consolidation:<BR>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.</P>
<P><BR>
Use of estimates:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Cash equivalents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less.  </P>
<P><BR>
Inventories:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for most inventories, with certain US Human Pharmaceutical inventory values on a last-in, first-out basis.  The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices.  Reserves are recorded for inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation.  The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.  See Note 16 for additional information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Property, plant and equipment:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.  When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss included in net income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest is capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of major construction and software development projects.  In 2001, 2000 and 1999, $2,232, $1,265 and $325 of interest cost were capitalized, respectively.</P>

<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives which are generally as follows:</P>

<P>Goodwill and Intangible assets:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and Intangible assets represent the excess of cost of acquired businesses over the underlying fair value of the tangible net assets acquired and the cost of technology, trademarks, New Animal Drug Applications ("NADAs"), Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") and other non-tangible assets acquired in product line acquisitions. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated period of benefit. The Company continually reviews its intangible assets to evaluate whether events or changes have occurred that would suggest an impairment of carrying value. An impairment would be recognized when expected undiscounted future operating cash flows are lower than the carrying value. The following table is net of accumulated amortization of $153,363 and $116,791 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>

<P>Foreign currency translation and transactions:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations are translated using average rates in effect during the year.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in income.  Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  The foreign currency translation adjustment for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is net of $318, $1,187 and $1,838, respectively, representing the foreign tax effects associated with long-term intercompany advances to foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P><BR>
Foreign exchange contracts:</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company selectively enters into foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell certain cash flows in non-functional currencies and to hedge certain firm commitments due in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange contracts, other than hedges of firm commitments, are accounted for as foreign currency transactions and gains or losses are included in income. Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction when it is completed.</P>
<P><BR>
Derivative Instruments:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and its corresponding amendments under SFAS No. 138, (referred to hereafter as "FAS 133"), on January 1, 2001. Under the provisions of FAS 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized periodically in earnings or stockholders' equity, depending on the intended use of the derivative and whether the derivative is classified as a hedging instrument. Changes in fair value of derivative instrument not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's derivative instruments, which are entered into on limited basis, consist principally of foreign currency forwards. These instruments are entered into in order to manage exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. None of the Company's derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments under FAS 133. As such, the Company carries its derivative instruments at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current period earnings. The adoption of FAS 133 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Revenue Recognition:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In the Company's US Human Pharmaceutical business, and to a lesser extent in Human Pharmaceuticals - International, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, or other managed-care reserves.  Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions.  The Company estimates these rebates, chargebacks, managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience.  The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income taxes:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities between amounts recorded for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2001, the Company's share of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries (excluding cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments) was approximately $121,000.  No provisions are made for U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of earnings which have been reinvested abroad or are expected to be returned in tax-free distributions. It is the Company's policy to provide for U.S. taxes payable with respect to earnings which the Company plans to repatriate.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Accounting for stock-based compensation:</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" by disclosing the pro forma effect of the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS 123 the Company has continued to account for stock options under Accounting Principle Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Comprehensive income:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", requires foreign currency translation adjustments and certain other items, which were reported separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in other comprehensive income (loss). The only components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the Company are foreign currency translation adjustments. Total comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999 is included in the Statement of Stockholders' Equity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Segment information:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" requires segment information to be prepared using the "management" approach. The management approach is based on the method that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>Software and Development Costs</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000 and 2001, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use".  Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization will begin as portions of the project are completed and ready for their intended purpose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs will be amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized software costs to date through December 31, 2001 amounted to approximately $39,200 and are included in other assets. Portions of the software are expected to be placed in service beginning in 2002.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141) and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), SFAS 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and requires these business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS 142 applies to all goodwill and intangibles acquired in a business combination. Under SFAS142, all goodwill and certain intangibles determined to have indefinite lives, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles acquired before initial application of the standard, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of the statement, and at least annually thereafter. Intangible assets other than goodwill will be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be 
Disposed of." SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and must be adopted as of the beginning of a fiscal year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has adopted SFAS 141 for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of the Oral Pharmaceuticals Business of FH Faulding ("OPB") (see Note 3), and will adopt SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company is presently evaluating the potential impact of these standards on its financial position and results of operations. However, due to the OPB acquisition and the number of acquisitions completed by the Company in previous years and related goodwill, the adoption of these statements could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2001 amortization related to goodwill was approximately $18,500.                .</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company is currently evaluating the effects the new rules may have on its financial statements and expects to adopt SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the new rules continue previous guidance to recognize impairment when the undiscounted cash flows will not recover its carrying amount. The impairment to be recognized will continue to be measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The computation of fair value now removes goodwill from consideration and incorporates a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach. The previous guidance provided in SFAS 121 is to be applied to assets to be disposed of by sale. Additionally, assets qualifying for discontinued operations treatment have been expanded beyond the former operating segment approach. Long-lived assets
 to be disposed by other than sale will now recognize impairment at the date of disposal, but will be considered assets to be held and used until that time. The Company is currently evaluating the effects the new rules may have on its financial statements and will adopt SFAS 144 as of January 1, 2002.</P>

</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001 the Company completed the acquisition of the OPB (See Note 3) and entered into a $900,000 credit agreement ("Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement. (See Note 11.) The Credit Facility includes restrictive covenants, and the most restrictive of these covenants is the total leverage ratio, which is total debt (as defined) divided by EBITDA (as defined).   This requires the calculation of EBITA, as defined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis and pro-forma for the acquisition of the OPB.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2001.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued compliance with these covenants in 2002 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA, and therefore the Company's ability to generate operating income, and also on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt. The Company has undertaken certain actions in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt as part of an overall deleveraging plan. The deleveraging plan includes aggressive expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets. Under this plan, the Company in December 2001 repaid term debt of $65,000 and exchanged common shares for $34,100 of convertible subordinated debt.  Additionally, in the first quarter of 2002, the Company exchanged common shares for approximately $109,500 of convertible subordinated debt.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above actions, combined with expected improvement in operating profit in 2002 relative to 2001, the Company fully expects to comply with these covenants throughout 2002.  Additionally, the Company believes it has the ability to further reduce operating or capital expenditures, and sufficient access to capital such that debt could be further reduced, if these actions become necessary to comply with the covenants.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 12, 2001, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the generic and proprietary oral solid dose pharmaceuticals business ("OPB acquisition") in the U.S. and China of F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited from Mayne Nickless Limited for total consideration of $660,000 in cash (approximately $669,800 including direct acquisition related costs). On October 2, 2001, Mayne closed its tender offer for Faulding's shares after having accepted the tender of more than 90% of Faulding's shares. On October 5, 2001, Alpharma gained operational and economic control of OPB subject to certain limitations. On December 12, 2001 Mayne acquired 100% of Faulding's shares and transferred the OPB to the Company in accordance with the acquisition agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations". The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of OPB operations are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition, December 12, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of the Oral Pharmaceuticals Business includes the operations of Purepac Pharmaceuticals and Faulding Laboratories in the United States and Foshan Faulding Pharmaceutical China. The Oral Pharmaceuticals Business includes research, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing of generic and proprietary oral solid dose pharmaceuticals in the United States and China.  In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, the OPB had net sales of $205,200 (unaudited) comprised of US net sales of $190,700 (unaudited) and China net sales of $14,500 (unaudited). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction generated significant one-time charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&amp;D"), the write up and subsequent write off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&amp;D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as fol

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;2, 2000, Alpharma announced the completion of the acquisition of the Medicated Feed Additive Business of Roche Ltd. ("MFA") for a cash payment of approximately $258,000 and issuance of a $30,000 promissory note to Roche.  The Note was paid in full in December 2000. In addition certain international inventories were purchased from Roche during a transition period of approximately three months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MFA business had 1999 sales of $213,000 and consists of products used in the livestock and poultry industries for preventing and treating diseases in animals. MFA sales by region are approximately 56% in North America, 20% in Europe and 12% in both Latin America and Southeast Asia.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition included inventories, five manufacturing and formulation sites in the United States, global product registrations, licenses, trademarks and associated intellectual property. Approximately 200 employees primarily in manufacturing and sales and marketing are included in the acquisition.  The Company is amortizing the acquired intangibles and goodwill over 20 years using the straight-line method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company financed the $258,000 cash payment under a $225,000 Bridge Financing Agreement ("Bridge Financing") with the balance of the financing being provided under its then current $300,000 credit facility ("1999 Credit Facility").  The Bridge Financing was arranged by Union Bank of Norway, First Union National Bank, and a group of other banks and was fully repaid on June 29, 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bridge Financing the Company paid a 1% fee for the banks commitment and in connection with drawing the funds.  Interest was payable at Libor plus 2.75%. In addition, because of the size of the acquisition, other possible acquisitions, and the existing restrictive covenants under the 1999 Credit Facility, the Company engaged and incurred fees to investment bankers to advise on alternatives and strategies to finance the Roche acquisition. All fees relating to the Bridge Financing were expensed in the second quarter of 2000.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact on cost of sales of the write-up of inventory to net realizable value pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 "Business Combinations" was reflected in cost of sales, as acquired manufactured inventory was sold during the second quarter. In addition, certain employees of AHD have been severed as a result of the acquisition and resulted in severance expense in the second quarter.</P>

</U></FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2000, the Company's Danish subsidiary sold the patents, trademarks, marketing authorizations, and inventory related to the Elyzol Dental Gel ("EDG") product for cash proceeds of approximately $8,250. Concurrently with this sale, and due to the specialized nature of the manufacturing process for EDG, the company entered into a Toll Manufacturing Agreement with the purchaser under which the Company will continue to manufacture EDG for the purchaser for a four year period. The Company will be reimbursed for direct manufacturing costs plus an agreed upon amount for overhead and a variable manufacturing profit which declines as production volumes increase. The Company also entered into a Transition Services agreement under which the Company provides regulatory and/or sales and marketing assistance to the purchaser for which it is reimbursed at agreed upon hourly rates.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the relative fair value of the assets sold and the Company's toll manufacturing obligation cannot be reliably estimated, the Company deferred, as of July 2000, the entire excess of the cash proceeds over the carrying amount of the assets sold and expenses associated with the sale. The deferral initially amounted to approximately $7,800 and is being amortized over the four year term of the Toll Manufacturing agreement on a straight-line basis, which management believes will approximate amortization using the units of production method. Income from the Transition Service Agreement and the contractual profit under the Toll Manufacturing Agreement are being recognized as services are provided or goods are sold to the purchaser.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately $1,900 and $1,000 of the deferral was recognized as income in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The remaining balance of approximately $4,850 has been deferred; $1,950 is included in accrued expenses and $2,900 is classified as other non-current liabilities.</P>

The loan and other agreements provided for additional loans under certain circumstances and an option to purchase all of Ascent's outstanding shares in 2003. In December 2000, the Company acquired a product line from Ascent in exchange for the cancellation of the $12,000 in outstanding loans and the termination of the existing financing and option agreements. In addition, the Company agreed to make a new fully collateralized short-term loan to Ascent of up to $6,250. During 2001 the Company loaned $6,250 and was fully repaid when Ascent was acquired by another company.</P>

</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the Company announced the decision to close or sell its leased aquatic animal health plant in Bellevue, Washington and terminate all 21 employees. A severance charge of $575 was established in the third quarter of 1999 when the employees were notified. During 1999, $231 of the severance was paid and the balance of $344 was paid in 2000. All significant production has been transferred to the AAHD production facility in Norway. At year end 1999 the Washington plant had ceased production and the fixed assets have been written down to their net realizable value of approximately $100. The result of the write down of leasehold improvements and certain machinery and equipment was a charge of approximately $1,600 in the fourth quarter of 1999. During 2000 the plant's lease expired, all operations ceased and all assets were disposed of.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001 the Company incurred charges as a result of management actions intended to improve future operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPD and FCD combined to form HPI and incurred charges of approximately $4,300 primarily for severance of 79 employees.  All employees are expected to be severed by June 30, 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in Note 3 as part of the combination of USPD and OPB - US severance charges of approximately $4,800 were expensed for 39 USPD employees. In addition, severance accruals of approximately $1,700 for 19 OPB - US employees were included in the purchase price allocation.  All employees are expected to be severed by June 30, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AHD changed three senior managers in the fourth quarter of 2001 and severance of approximately $1,100 was incurred. In addition, new management in its review of current projects decided to discontinue support of the optibreed project and incurred charges of approximately $11,200 to reflect the write down of optibreed inventory and the equity investment in the company which manufactured optibreed inventory.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In the first quarter of 2002 the Company became aware of process deficiencies, which occurred in 2001 for two products sold by USHP.  One of these products was manufactured by a contract manufacturer.  Based on the nature of the deficiencies, the Company determined that a voluntary recall of certain of these products from its direct customers was required.  Accordingly, at December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $10,700 for these recalls, consisting primarily of inventory write-offs for unsaleable product and estimated disposal costs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of dilution attributable to the stock options determined by the treasury stock method depends on the average market price of the Company's common stock for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 stock options to purchase 150,000 and 650,000 shares, respectively, were not included because the option price was greater than the average price. Stock options had an anti-dilutive effect in 2001 and therefore stock options to purchase 2,675,308 shares were not included in the diluted EPS calculation. </P>

<U><P>Senior debt<BR>
</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpharma Operating Corporation ("Alpharma Operating Corporation"), and certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement ("2001 Credit Facility") with the Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions that provides up to a maximum of $900,000 of senior credit facilities. The 2001 Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and a pledge of 65% of the shares of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  The agreement replaced the prior revolving credit facility, provided the funds required for the acquisition of OPB and related financing costs and increased overall credit availability. The 1999 revolving credit facility was repaid on October 5, 2001 by drawing down on the 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility provides for (i) a $300,000 six year revolving credit facility; (ii) a $175,000 six year Term Loan A; and (iii) a $425,000 seven year Term Loan B.  In December 2001 the Company repaid $65,000 of the Term A and Term B loans resulting in the maximum amount available to be borrowed under the 2001 Credit Facility being reduced to $835,000. As a result of repaying the 1999 revolving credit facility and the $65,000 term loan reduction, the Company has recorded an extraordinary expense for the early extinguishment of debt of $3,672 ($2,240 after tax) in 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility has several financial covenants including a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio, senior debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio (see Note 2B).  Interest on the facility will be at the LIBOR rate with a margin of between 1.25% and 3.25% depending on the ratio of total debt to EBITDA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility's Term A is payable in quarterly installments ranging from $4,458 to $7,802 through 2007.  The Term  B is payable in quarterly installments of $947 with balloon payment of $353,379 in 2008.  In the event that more than $10,000 of either the 05 Notes or 06 Notes are outstanding within six months of their due date, the entire remaining balance of the Term A, Term B and the Revolving Credit becomes due and payable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company provided a $260,000 letter of credit for the benefit of Mayne related to the  OPB Acquisition. In addition, bridge financing was needed to finance the purchase price prior to the issuance of the senior subordinated note. All costs and fees associated with the letter of credit and bridge financing were capitalized and amortized over the period they were outstanding (October 5 through December 12, 2001).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2002, the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap in order to fix the interest rate on variable rate borrowings of approximately $60,000 of the term debt under the 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has issued Industrial Development Revenue Bonds in connection with various expansion projects. At December 31, 2001 bonds with a $3,000 principal amount require monthly interest payments at a floating rate approximating the current money market rate on tax exempt bonds plus agency and other fees (total rate approximately 4.5%). Bonds with a $3,720 principal amount require fixed interest payments of between 6.875% and 7.25%. The bonds are payable in varying amounts through 2009. Plant and equipment with an approximate net book value of $18,500 serve as collateral for these loans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortgage notes payable denominated in Norwegian Kroner (NOK) include amounts issued in connection with the construction and subsequent expansion of a pharmaceutical facility in Lier, Norway. The mortgage is collateralized by this facility (net book value $32,800). The debt was borrowed in a number of tranches over the construction period and interest is fixed for specified periods based on actual yields of Norgeskreditt publicly traded bonds plus a lending margin of 0.70%. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. The tranches are repayable in semiannual installments through 2021.  Yearly principal payments are approximately $1,300.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgage notes payable also include amounts issued in 1997 ($5,356) to finance a production unit at an Aquatic Animal Health facility in Overhalla, Norway. The mortgage has a 12 year term and is repayable in 8 equal remaining installments in years 2002 - 2009. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was 7.6% and 8.1%, respectively. Plant equipment with a net book value of $6,600 serve as collateral for the note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma Oslo has various loans with government development agencies and banks which have been used for acquisitions and construction projects. Annual payments are $958 through 2003, $562 in 2004 and $166 through 2012. The weighted average interest rate of the loans at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was  7.7% and 7.8%, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<U>Subordinated debt</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12% Senior subordinated notes:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2001, in connection with the formal closing of the OPB acquisition, Alpharma Operating Corporation sold $200,000 in principal amount of 12% senior subordinated notes due 2009 to affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and CIBC World Markets Corp. The notes are guaranteed by the Company and the principal domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The notes include restrictive covenants similar to those included in the 2001 Credit Facility but are generally less restrictive. These notes replaced the bridge financing facility which was in place prior to the closing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1999, the Company issued $170,000 principal amount of 3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "06 Notes"). The 06 Notes pay cash interest of 3% per annum, calculated on the initial principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2006 at a price of 134.104% of the initial principal amount. The payment of the principal amount of the Notes at maturity (or earlier, if the Notes are redeemed by the Company prior to maturity), together with cash interest paid over the term of the Notes, will yield investors 6.875% per annum. The interest accrued but which will not be paid prior to maturity (3.875% per annum) is reflected as long-term debt in the accounts of the Company. The 06 Notes are redeemable by the Company after June 16, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 06 Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into 31.1429 shares of the Company's Class A Common stock per one thousand dollars of initial principal amount of 06 Notes. This ratio results in an initial conversion price of $32.11 per share. The number of shares into which a 06 Note is convertible will not be adjusted for the accretion of principal or for accrued interest.  The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $164,000 were used to retire outstanding senior long-term debt principally outstanding under the 1999 Credit Facility. This created the capacity under the 1999 Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of Isis in the second quarter of 1999. (See Note 3.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In March 2002, the Company completed an exchange of 3,433,104 shares of its Class A Common Stock for a portion of its 06 Notes having an approximate principal value of $53,400.  The exchange resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $27,000 in the first quarter of 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, the Company issued $125,000 of 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "05 Notes") due 2005.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2001, the Company has state loss carryforwards in several states totaling  approximately $22,000, which are available to offset future taxable income and expire between 2008 and 2014.  The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these state loss carryforwards, and believes that it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will be available to reduce future state income tax liabilities.  The Company also has foreign loss carryforwards in twelve countries as of December 31, 2001, of approximately $47,000, which are available to offset future taxable income, and have carryforward periods ranging from five years to unlimited.  The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these foreign loss carryforwards.  Based on analysis of current information, which indicated that it is not likely that some of these state and  foreign losses will be realized, a valuation allowance has been established for a portion of the
se loss carryforwards.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a qualified noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan covering the majority of its domestic employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five years compensation during the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. The plan assets are under a single custodian and a single investment manager. Plan assets are invested in equities, government securities and bonds. In addition, the Company has unfunded supplemental executive pension plans providing additional benefits to certain employees. </P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an unfunded postretirement medical and nominal life insurance plan ("postretirement benefits") covering certain domestic employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993. The plan has not been extended to any additional employees. Retired employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993 are required to contribute for coverage as if they were active employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postretirement transition obligation as of January 1, 1993 of $1,079 is being amortized over twenty years. The discount rate used in determining the 2001, 2000 and 1999 expense was 7.50%, 7.75% and 8.00%, respectively. The health care cost trend rate was 9.0% declining to 5.0% over a ten year period, remaining level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the reported amounts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, A.L. Industrier purchased a convertible subordinated note issued by the Company in the amount of $67,850. In October 2001 the Company converted the convertible subordinate note into 2,372,897 shares of Class B common stock. (See Note 11.) In addition, as of December 31, 2001 there was a net current receivable of $290 from A.L. Industrier and as of December 31, 2000 there was a net current payable of $514 to A.L. Industrier.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and A.L. Industrier have an administrative service agreement whereby the Company provides management services to A.L. Industrier. The agreement provides for payment equal to the direct and indirect cost of providing the services subject to a minimum amount. The agreement is automatically extended for one year each January 1, but may be terminated by either party upon six months notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the agreement to purchase Alpharma Oslo, A.L. Industrier retained the ownership of the Sk&oslash;yen manufacturing facility and administrative offices (not including leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment) and leases it to the Company. The Company is required to pay all expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the facility in addition to nominal rent. The lease has an initial 20 year term and is renewable at the then fair rental value at the option of the Company for four consecutive five year terms.</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  This class action has been brought on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company's securities between April 28, 1999 and October 30, 2000.  The Company is named as a defendant along with one of its board members, two of its current officers and one of its former officers.  The class action complaint alleges that, among other things, the plaintiffs were damaged when they acquired the Company's securities because, as a result of (1) alleged irregularities in the Company's animal health business in Brazil, (2) allegedly improper revenue recognition practices and (3) the October 2000 revision of its financial results for 1999 and 2000, the Company's previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company's securities.  The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and
 Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint on legal grounds, and discovery is stayed pending the determination of that motion.  Based on the Company's preliminary investigation, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses which it intends to vigorously assert against the class action.  Additionally, the Company has filed a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the named individual defendants under its directors' and officers' insurance policies and believes that insurance coverage exists to the extent of the policy limits for the costs incurred in defending the claims and any adverse judgment or settlement, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the relevant insurance policy.  Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class action will result in liability which will be material to the Company's financial position. 
 However, because of the early stage of this matter, it is not possible for the Company to conclude that resolution of the lawsuit will not be material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or year in which it occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacitracin zinc, one of the Company's feed additive products has been banned from sale in the European Union (the "EU") effective July 1, 1999. While initial efforts to reverse the ban in court were unsuccessful, the Company is continuing to pursue initiatives based on scientific evidence available for the product, to limit the effects of this ban. In addition, certain other countries, not presently material to the Company's sales of bacitracin zinc have either followed the EU's ban or are considering such action. The existing governmental actions negatively impact the Company's business but are not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. However, if either the EU acts to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin based products or there is an expansion of the ban to additional countries where the Company has material sales of bacitracin based products, the resultant loss of sales could be material to t
he financial condition and results of operations of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDA filed under paragraph IV for Gabapentin capsules, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDA filed under paragraph IV for Gabapentin tablets, the Company was sued on December 12, 1999,<B> </B>by Pfizer in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under the same two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's Gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and the FDA that its proposed generic Gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.  In th
e litigation concerning the Company's Gabapentin capsules, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the two patents, which was subsequently denied.  The Company filed in the tablet litigation, and renewed in the capsule litigation, the Company's motion of summary judgment of non-infringement on Pfizer's patents.  These motions are under consideration by the district court.  Discovery is complete and the case is awaiting trial.  No trial date has been set, but the two cases have been consolidated for trial. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>During the lawsuits regarding Gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a Gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels.  After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under Paragraph IV that the Company's proposed Gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable.  In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this patent.  The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent.  This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  Fact discovery has closed and expert discovery is scheduled to close in March 2002.  No trial date has been set.  Unless and until the 
Company decides to market its Gabapentin tablets or capsules, the Company would, at most, only be liable to Pfizer for its legal costs and not any monetary damages.  To date, the Company has not marketed these pharmaceuticals. There is the possibility that as a result of this litigation the Company could be prevented from marketing the Company's Gabapentin capsules or tablets until Pfizer's patents expire.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the launch of Gabapentin, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the manufacturer of the active ingredient (the "API") of Gabapentin under which the Company has acquired API inventory.  Approximately $4,200 of raw material inventory has been acquired at December 31, 2001.  The terms of the Company's agreement with the API supplier may require additional payments to the supplier based on the sale price of the finished product.  Additionally, if the API is unsold after certain defined periods of time, up to an additional $18,300 may become payable related to the API on hand at December 31, 2001.  The Company cannot predict the outcome of the Gabapentin litigation; however, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, or other factors preventing the Company from selling the finished product, the Company will reassess the net realizable value of the API inventory, and may incur a charge to write-down API inventory on hand to this net realizable value and reco
rd any required contingent payments under the supply agreement.  The maximum charge could range from $22,500 based on inventory currently on hand, to $63,000 if all planned API purchases in 2002 are made. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with two suppliers regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials.  While management believes the resolutions of these disputes will not be material to the Company's financial position, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>

The Company has incurred approximately $11,600 in costs related to general and certain environmental cleanup at the facility.  A corresponding receivable from the Company's insurers in the amount of $11,336 has been recorded as the Company believes the costs incurred related to the incident are covered by its insurance.  The Company does not expect this incident to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.</P>

If the minimum or agreed quantities are not purchased, the Company must reimburse the supplier a percentage of the fixed costs related to the unpurchased quantities. The Company has purchased required minimums in 2001 and expects to purchase the minimums and yearly agreed quantities of approximately $57,000 in 2002. In the case of the Decoquinate agreement there are contingent payments which may be required of either party upon early termination of the agreement depending on the circumstances of the termination. The Company considers the possibility of early termination of the agreement to be remote.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had foreign currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of approximately $46,900 and $37,300, respectively. These contracts called for the exchange of Scandinavian and European currencies and in some cases the U.S. Dollar to meet commitments in or sell cash flows generated in non-functional currencies. All outstanding contracts will expire in 2002 and the unrealized gains and losses are not material.  The Company does not account for these transactions as hedges under FAS 133. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt other than the subordinated notes approximates fair value because a significant portion of the underlying debt is at variable rates and reprices frequently. The fair value of the 2005 and 2006 subordinated notes is based on the bid price of the notes, which are publicly traded.  The fair value of the 2009 subordinated notes, which are not publicly traded, has been deemed to approximate their carrying amount at December 31, 2001, as the interest rates used to determine the Company's margin on its variable rate debt did not change significantly from the notes' date of issue (December 12,2001) to December 31, 2001.  The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes at December 31,
 2001 and 2000 was as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Company's 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan"), the Company may grant options to key employees to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. The maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Plan is 6,500,000. In addition, the Company has a Non-Employee Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan") which provides for the issue of up to 150,000 shares of Class A Common stock. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Options granted expire from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options are exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. The Plan permits a cash appreciation right to be granted to certain employees. Included in options outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2001 are options to purchase 32,250 shares with cash appreciation rights, 21,600 of wh
ich are exercisable. If an option holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which are not vested at the date of termination are forfeited. As of December&nbsp;31, 2001 and 2000, options for 1,775,038 and 2,383,377 shares, respectively, were available for future grant.</P>

<P>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Information Concerning Business Segments and Geographic Operations:</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the Company adopted SFAS 131. The Company's reportable segments are the four decentralized divisions described in Note 1, (i.e. IPD, FCD, USHP, AP). Each division had a president and operates in a distinct business and/or geographic area. In January 2001 the AAHD was combined with the AHD into Animal Health. In September 2001, the Company announced the creation of Human Pharmaceuticals International ("HPI") to be composed of IPD, FCD and the Chinese operations of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals.  In October 2001, the Company announced the creation of U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP") to be composed of USPD and the U.S. operations of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of each segment are evaluated based on earnings before interest and taxes (operating income). Corporate expenses and certain other expenses or income not directly attributable to the segments are not allocated. Eliminations include intersegment sales. Geographic revenues represent sales to third parties by country in which the selling legal entity is domiciled. Operating assets directly attributable to business segments are included in identifiable assets (i.e. sum of accounts receivable, inventories, net property, plant and equipment and net intangible assets). Cash, prepaid expenses, and other corporate and non-allocated assets are included in unallocated. For geographic reporting long lived assets include net property, plant and equipment and net intangibles.  Segment data includes immaterial intersegment revenues. No customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introductory</I>.

Alpharma Inc., the direct parent corporation of the Company ("Alpharma"), and the other entities named in <U>Schedule&nbsp;A</U> (collectively with Alpharma, the "Guarantors") as guarantors of the payment on the Notes have agreed to be a party to this agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The holders of the Securities will be entitled to the benefits of a Shelf Registration Rights Agreement, to be dated as of December 12, 2001 (the "Shelf Registration Rights Agreement"), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Purchasers, pursuant to which the Company will agree to file, on or prior to the later of 15 days after the Acquisition closes or 90 days from the Issue Date, a shelf registration statement with the Commission.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The payment of principal of, premium and Liquidated Damages (as defined in this Agreement), if any, and interest on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally by Alpharma and the Guarantors, pursuant to their guarantees (the "Note Guarantees").  The Notes and the Note Guarantees attached thereto are herein collectively referred to as the "Securities."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Securities are being sold as part of the financing that will be used to consummate the acquisition by Alpharma through its subsidiary Oral Pharmaceuticals Acquisition Corp.

Limited, a publicly traded corporation organized under the laws of Australia, ("Faulding") from Mayne Nickless Limited ("Mayne"), a publicly traded corporation organized under the laws of Australia, pursuant to a Put and Call Option Agreement dated as of July 12, 2001, as amended on August 17 and 30, 2001; September 17, 24 and 28, 2001 and December 6, 2001 (as amended, the "Put and Call Option Agreement") for total consideration of $660.0 million in cash, subject to price adjustments.  On October 5, 2001, Mayne acquired, through its subsidiary Mayne Health Logistics Pty. Limited ("BidCo"), more than 90% of the outstanding shares
 of stock and options of Faulding, pursuant to tender offers (the "Offers") conducted in accordance with Australian law, giving BidCo the right to acquire the shares of stock not then owned by BidCo pursuant to a compulsory acquisition (the "Compulsory Acquisition").  Concurrently with the consummation of the Offers, Mayne and Alpharma entered into a Management Agreement (the "Management Agreement") under which Alpharma has assumed operational control of the Acquired Business.  Mayne completed the Compulsory Acquisition on November 19, 2001. After the separation of the Acquired Business from the remainder of Faulding's businesses, Mayne will be entitled to sell the stock of BidCo to Alpharma under a put option (the "Put Option"), and Alpharma will be entitled to purchase the assets of the Acquired Business from BidCo under a call option, in accordance with the terms of the Put and Call Option Agreement (such acquisition, the "Acquisition").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mayne notified Alpharma of the exercise of the Put Option on December 6, 2001 (Australian time).  On the date hereof, which is the date the Acquisition is being consummated (the "Acquisition Closing Date"), Alpharma has paid $400.0 million of the $660.0 million acquisition price by offsetting Mayne's obligation to repay the Parent Loan against an equal amount of the purchase price.  Mayne has drawn $260.0 million under the letter of credit in satisfaction of the remaining portion of the acquisition price.  The U.S. subsidiaries of the Company constituting part of the Acquired Business will execute a Note Guarantee (as defined herein) by which they will become Guarantors of the Notes and a joinder to the Shelf Registration Rights Agreement (the "Shelf Registration Joinder Agreement") within 30 days after the date hereof (such U.S. subsidiaries, together with Foshan Faulding Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Faulding China Limited, the "Acquired Subsidiaries").</P>

In connection with the closing of the Senior Credit F
acilities, A.L. Industrier AS ("ALI"), the parent company of Alpharma, surrendered approximately US $67,850,000 in aggregate principal amount of Alpharma's 5 3/4% Senior Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2005 held by it in exchange for approximately 2,372,918 shares of Class B Common Stock of Alpharma (the "ALI Subordinated Note Exchange").  The Acquisition, the issuance of the Letter of Credit, the Parent Loan, the ALI Subordinated Note Exchange and all related transactions are collectively referred to as the "Transaction."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proceeds from the sale of the Securities will be applied by the Company to reimburse Banc of America Bridge LLC ("Banc of America Bridge") upon Banc of America Bridge's funding of its obligations under the Participation Agreement dated as of October 5, 2001 ("Participation Agreement") between Banc of America Bridge and the Issuing Bank at such time as Mayne draws under the Letter of Credit on the Acquisition Date.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have participated in the preparation of and reviewed the Offering Memorandum.  Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish factual matters and because of the non-legal character of many determinations involved in the preparation of the Offering Memorandum, we are not passing upon, do not assume responsibility for and make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Offering Memorandum.  However, during the course of such preparation, we examined various documents, including the documents referred to above, and participated in various conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantors, representatives of the independent accountants for the Company and the Guarantors and your representatives and counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Offering Memorandum and related matters were reviewed and discussed and, although we are not 
passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Offering Memorandum and have not made any independent check or verification thereof, during the course of such participation and on the basis of the foregoing (relying as to materiality to the extent we deemed appropriate upon the opinions of officers and other representative of the Company), no facts came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Offering Memorandum, as of the date hereof, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that we make no such statement with respect to the financial data included therein or omitted therefrom. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not undertaken any search of court records for purposes of this letter.  We have assumed for purposes of this letter:  the statements of fact in each document we have reviewed for purposes of this letter are accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; that the Purchase Agreement, Registration Rights Agreement, Indenture and every other agreement we have examined for purposes of this letter constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party to that document and that each such party has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to such party to the extent necessary to entitle such party to enforce such agreement (except that we make no such assumption with respect to the Company or the Guarantors); that (other than with respect to the Company and the Guarantors) the Purchase Agreement, Registration Rights Agreement
, Notes and Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered; and that you have acted in good faith and without notice of any fact which has caused you to reach any conclusion contrary to any of the conclusions provided in this letter. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In preparing this letter we have relied without independent verification upon and have assumed the accuracy of: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Purchase Agreement and other documents specifically identified at the beginning of this letter as having been read by us; (iii) factual information provided to us by the Company or its representatives; and (iv) factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable.  For purposes of numbered paragraphs 1 and 2, we have relied exclusively upon certificates issued by governmental authorities in the relevant jurisdictions and such opinions are not intended to provide any conclusion or assurance beyond that conveyed by those certificates. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever this letter provides advice about (or based upon) our knowledge of any particular information or about any information which has or has not come to our attention such advice is based entirely on the actual present knowledge at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears by the lawyers with Kirkland &amp; Ellis at that time who spent substantial time representing the Company and the Guarantors in connection with the sale and issuance of the Notes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each opinion (an "enforceability opinion") in this letter that any particular contract is a valid and binding obligation or is enforceable in accordance with its terms is subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws and judicially developed doctrines in this area such as substantive consolidation and equitable subordination;  (ii) the effect of general principles of equity; and (iii) other commonly recognized statutory and judicial constraints on enforceability including statutes of limitations. "General principles of equity" include but are not limited to: principles limiting the availability of specific performance and injunctive relief; principles which limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; principles requiring reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of an agreement by the party seeking enforcement; principles which may permit a par
ty to cure a material failure to perform its obligations; and principles affording equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel.  It is possible that terms in a particular contract covered by our enforceability opinion  may not prove enforceable for reasons other than those explicitly cited in this letter should an actual enforcement action be brought, but (subject to all the exceptions, qualifications, exclusions and other limitations contained in this letter) such unenforceability would not in our opinion prevent the party entitled to enforce that contract from realizing the principal benefits purported to be provided to that party by the terms in that contract which are covered by our enforceability opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our advice on every legal issue addressed in this letter is based exclusively on the internal laws of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the federal law of the United States, and represents our opinion as to how that issue would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court in the jurisdiction which enacted such law.  In our opinion, New York state courts would apply New York state law to resolve state law issues arising under the Indenture, Notes, Purchase Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement (collectively, the "<U>Transaction Agreements</U>").  We express no opinion as to what law might be applied by any other courts to resolve any issue addressed by our opinion and we express no opinion as to whether any relevant difference exists between the laws upon which our opinions are based and any other laws which may actually be applied to resolve issues which may arise under the Transaction Agreements.  The manner in which any particular issue w
ould be treated in any actual court case would depend in part on facts and circumstances particular to the case and would also depend on how the court involved chose to exercise the wide discretionary authority generally available to it.  This letter is not intended to guarantee the outcome of any legal dispute which may arise in the future. We express no opinion  with respect to any state securities (or "blue sky") laws or regulations.  None of the opinions or other  advice contained in this letter considers or covers (i) any financial statements or supporting schedules (or any notes to any such statements or schedules) or other financial or statistical information set forth in (or omitted from) the Offering Memorandum or (ii) any rules and regulations of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. relating to the compensation of the Initial Purchasers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears.  We do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which we do not have knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law or other governmental requirement or interpretation thereof covered by any of our opinions or advice, or for any other reason.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This letter may be relied upon by the Initial Purchasers only for the purpose served by the provision in the Purchase Agreement cited in the initial paragraph of this letter in response to which it has been delivered.  Without our written consent: (i) no person other than the Initial Purchasers may rely on this letter for any purpose, except that the Trustee under the Indenture may rely upon this letter to the same extent as if it were an addressee hereof; (ii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any financial statements, prospectus, private placement memorandum or other similar document; (iii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any other document or communication which might encourage reliance upon this letter by any person or for any purpose excluded by the restrictions in this paragraph; and (iv) copies of this letter may not be furnished to anyone for purposes of encouraging such reliance. </P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of my professional engagement in connection with the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement was not to establish factual matters, and preparation of the Offering Memorandum involved many determinations of a wholly or partially nonlegal character.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have acted as United States FDA regulatory counsel to Alpharma Operating Corporation (the "Issuer"), and Alpharma, Inc. ("Alpharma") in connection with the sale by Alpharma Operating Corp. to Bank of America Securities LLC and CIBC World Markets Corporation (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated _______, 200[_], by and among the Issuer, Alpharma, and the Underwriters, of $200,000,000 of the Issuer's [___]% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "Securities"), to be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by Alpharma and all of Alpharma's existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, other than the Issuer and certain immaterial domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors").  An Offering Memorandum dated ________, 200[_] relating to the offering of the Securities (the "Offering Memorandum") has been prepared by the Issuer and _________ for your information and for delivery to prospective purchasers of the Securities.  For the avoidance of doubt, the term the "I

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the purpose of this opinion, we relied solely as to matters of fact on the representations in the Offering Memorandum, and we have not verified the factual statements or conclusions set forth in the Offering Memorandum but have assumed their validity.  We have also relied upon certificates attached to this opinion.  Moreover, we have not conducted any independent evaluation or audit of the Issuer's or Alpharma's compliance status with respect to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDC Act"), the Biological Products provisions of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, or the Controlled Substances Act, as amended, and any regulations issued under any of those acts.  Subject to the above limitations, and Alpharma's corporate counsel's representations as to materiality, we are of the opinion that:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Except as described in the Regulatory Portion of the Offering Memorandum, and subject to the limitations to this opinion described above, we have no reason to believe that the business of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as described in the Offering Memorandum under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Business," is not being conducted in all material respects in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of the FDC Act, the Biological Products provisions of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the Controlled Substances Act, as amended, and any regulations issued under any of those acts, as those statutes and regulations are currently being enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA").</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>To the best of our knowledge, and subject to the limitations to this opinion described above, there are no administrative enforcement or legal actions pending or contemplated against the Issuer or the Guarantors by either the FDA or the DEA other than (a) those described in the Offering Memorandum, and (b) the existing Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction filed on August 11, 1992 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in the case <U>United States of America v. Barre-National, Inc.</U>, Civ. No. L-92-2147; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Nothing has come to our attention which leads us to believe that the descriptions set forth in the Regulatory Portion of the Offering Memorandum of the FDC Act, the Biological Products provisions of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the Controlled Substances Act, as amended, and any regulations issued under any of those acts, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact relating to such Acts or regulations required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement do not and will not (i) violate any requirement of the FDC Act, the Biological Products provisions of the Public Health Service Act and the Controlled Substances Act, or any regulation issued under any of those acts; or (ii) result in the creation of a lien, charge, or encumbrance upon any property or assets of Alpharma or any of its subsidiaries due to the operation of any of those acts or of any regulation issued under any of them.</LI></P></OL>

The Company shall pay interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an "Interest Payment Date").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;In addition, at any time prior to December 15, 2005, the Company may redeem all or part of the Notes and Remarketed Notes upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice in cash in U.S. Dollars at a redemption price equal to the sum of (x)&nbsp;the aggregate principal amount thereof, <I>plus</I> (y)&nbsp;accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable date of redemption, <I>plus</I> (z)&nbsp;the Make-Whole Premium; provided that the Company may not redeem any Notes pursuant to this paragraph 4(iii) or any Remarketed Notes pursuant to the corresponding provisions of the Exchange Indenture unless such offers of redemption are made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Notes and Remarketed Notes pursuant to this paragraph 4(iii) and the corresponding provision of the Exchange Indenture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv)&#9;In addition, with respect to any Notes held by the Purchasers, for so long as the Purchasers hold any such Notes, the Company may redeem all, but not less than all, of such Notes, upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice in cash in U.S. Dollars, at a redemption price equal to 112% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Notes held by the Purchasers that have not been redeemed pursuant to this paragraph 4(iv) by December 15, 2005 shall thereafter be redeemable as permitted in paragraph 4(i) above.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Mandatory Redemption</I>.  Except as set forth in paragraph 6 below, the Company is not required to make a mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Repurchase at Option of Holder</I>.  (a)  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment").  Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the date specified in such notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the Agreement and described in such notice.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Alpharma may apply such Net Proceeds at its option: (i) to permanently reduce Senior Debt of Alpharma, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness that is subordinated to the Notes or intercompany Indebtedness) and, if the Senior Debt being repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (ii) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business; (iii) to make a capital expenditure in or that is used or useful in a Permitted Business; or (iv) to acquire other long-term assets in or that are used or useful in a Permitted Business.  Pending the final applications of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the 
Agreement.  Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will constitute "Excess Proceeds".  When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all Holders and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this Agreement with respect to offers to purchase with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, to the date of purchase.  If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Agreement.  If the aggregate principal amount of Notes an
d such other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness tendered.  Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Selection and Notice of Redemption</I>.  In case the Company is entitled to, and elects to, redeem less than all of the Notes, the Company shall redeem the Notes pro rata from each Holder (or as nearly pro rata as practicable).  For all purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be redeemed.  Notices of redemption may not be conditional.  If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.  A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.  Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.  On and af
ter the redemption date, interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Denominations, Transfer, Exchange</I>.  The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $150,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.  The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged as provided in the Agreement.  The Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption.  Also, the Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Persons Deemed Owners</I>.  The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as its owner for all purposes.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Amendment, Supplement and Waiver</I>.  Subject to certain exceptions, the Agreement or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, if any, voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Agreement or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).  Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Agreement or the Notes may be amended or supplemented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; to pro
vide for the assumption of the Company's or any Guarantor's obligations to Holders in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's or such Guarantor's assets; to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Agreement of any such Holder; or to allow any Guarantor to execute a Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Defaults and Remedies</I>.  In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to Alpharma, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.  If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company specifying the respective Event of Default; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that so long as any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall be outstanding, that acceleration shall not be effective until the earlier of (1) an acceleration of Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement; or (2) five business days after receipt by the Company and the Agent under the Credit Agreement of written notice of the acceleration
 of the Notes.  Holders of the Notes may enforce the Agreement or the Notes as provided in the Agreement.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company may waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Agreement except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Liquidated Damages on, or the principal of, the Notes.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of any Event of Default occurring by reason of any willful action or inaction taken or not taken by or on behalf of Alpharma or the Company with the intention of avoiding payment of the premium that the Company would have had to pay if the Company then had elected to redeem the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement concerning optional redemption, an equivalent premium shall also become and be immediately due and payable to the extent permitted by law upon the acceleration of the Notes.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Recourse Against Others</I>.  No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of Alpharma, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of Alpharma, the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Notes, the Agreement, the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.  Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.  The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Additional Rights of Holders</I>.  In addition to the rights provided to Holders under the Agreement, Holders shall have all the rights set forth in the Shelf Registration Rights Agreement  dated as of  December 12, 2001, between the Company, Alpharma, the Guarantors and the parties named on the signature pages thereof (the "<I>Shelf Registration Rights Agreement</I>").</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference is made to the Shelf Registration Rights Agreement dated December 12, 2001 (the "<B>Registration Agreement</B>"), by and among Alpharma Operating Corporation ("<B>Operating</B>"), the Guarantors listed on Schedule A thereto (such Guarantors and Operating are collectively known herein as "<B>Alpharma</B>"), Banc of America Bridge LLC ("<B>Bridge</B>") and CIBC Inc. ("<B>CIBC</B>").  All terms used in this letter and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Registration Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Registration Agreement, Alpharma agreed to (x) cause to be filed a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act on or before the date which is 90 days from the Issue Date (the <B>"Shelf Filing Deadline"</B>), (y) use its best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or before the 90th day after the Shelf Filing Deadline, and (z) keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Sections 5(a) and (b) of the Shelf Registration Statement to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Exchange Notes by the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of the Registration Agreement, the Securities Act and certain other rules and regulations.  Because the Issue Date was December 12, 2001, the current Shelf Filing Deadline is March 12, 2001. 
 All events set forth in clauses (x) through (z) above are referred to herein as the "<B>Alpharma Filing Requirements</B>."  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pursuant to Section 4 of the Registration Agreement if, (x) the Shelf Registration Statement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the Shelf Filing Deadline, (y) the Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 90th day after the Shelf Filing Deadline, or (z) in certain circumstances, if the Shelf Registration Statement is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter cease to be effective or fails to be usable in connection with resales of Notes (each such event referred to in clauses (x) through (z), a "<B>Registration Default</B>"), then Alpharma shall pay to each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities certain liquidated damages as set forth therein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By signing below, you hereby (i) extend until April 1, 2002, the Shelf Filing Deadline and compliance by Alpharma with the Alpharma Filing Requirements, and (ii) waive (y) Alpharma's Registration Default resulting from Alpharma's failure to file a Shelf Registration Statement on or before March 12, 2002, and (z) the right of the undersigned to receive liquidated damages pursuant to Section 4 of the Registration Agreement in connection with any Registration Default for the period from March 12, 2002 through and including April 1, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpharma and the undersigned hereby agree that commencing upon April 1, 2002, the Alpharma Filing Requirements and the right of the undersigned to receive liquidated damages pursuant to Section 4 of the Registration Agreement shall be reinstated in accordance with the terms of the Registration Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This letter is subject to the provisions of Section 11(d) of the Registration Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Registration Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement, except to the extent of the consent specifically provided above, are and shall continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed.  The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this letter shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Banc of America Bridge or CIBC under the Registration Agreement or the Note Purchase Agreement, nor constitute a waiver of any other provision of the Registration Agreement or any provision of the Note Purchase Agreement.</P>

(the "Company"), the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division of Alpharma and Alpharma USPD Inc. (together the "Alpharma Group").  This letter will supercede the terms and conditions of the letter agreement dated January 13, 1997 between the Company and you.</P>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>You confirm your resignation from all officer and director positions with the Alpharma Group effective as of October 31, 2001.  You shall continue as an employee of the Alpharma Group until January 15, 2002, at which time, without further action on your part or the part of the Alpharma Group, your resignation as an employee of each entity in the Alpharma Group shall be fully effective.   From October 31, 2001 through January 15, 2002, you agree to be available to the management of the Alpharma Group as a consultant at the Owings Mills offices of the Alpharma Group and by telephone to provide such services and cooperation as the Company and its officers shall reasonably request.  It is agreed and understood that the resignations, both as a director and officer and as an employee, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall be irrevocable upon your acceptance of and the effectiveness of this Letter Agreement.</LI>

<P>(ii) An amount equal to $505,000 per annum for the period from January 16, 2002 through January 15, 2004  (the "Separation Payment Period"); and  </P>

<P>All payments required by this subparagraph shall be made at the time, and subject to the tax withholding and deductions, as are regular salary payments made to executives of the Alpharma Group.</P>

<LI>In accordance with the terms of the Alpharma Inc. Stock Option Plan, all options not vested on or before February 15, 2002 shall be extinguished and not subject to further exercise.  For avoidance of doubt, any stock options which, by the terms of the Plan and the applicable stock option contracts between you and the Company, remain unvested as of February 14, 2002, shall not be exercisable and shall be extinguished as at February 14, 2002.  In recognition of stock options that would have become exercisable had you continued as an employee of the Alpharma Group through December 31, 2002, the Company shall make you a payment (subject to all applicable tax withholding) of $239,831.  Such payment shall be made to you on or before February 28, 2002.  All options that are currently vested shall remain exercisable until February 15, 2002.</LI>

<LI>Your status as an active employee in the any pension plan of the Alpharma Group in which you presently are a participant shall terminate on January 15, 2002, and you shall not be entitled to any further credit for service for vesting or benefit accrual thereunder after such date.  All rights under such plan which are vested as of January 15, 2002 shall remain unaffected by this Letter Agreement.</LI>

<LI>In consideration of the promises of the Alpharma Group in paragraph 2 above and otherwise herein, which you acknowledge are in excess of what you would otherwise be entitled to receive, you hereby release each of the entities of the Alpharma Group, their affiliates, officers, employees and directors (collectively the "Alpharma Releasees") from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, expenses and liabilities, whether now known or unknown, which you now have or may have against the Alpharma Releasees which relate in any way to your employment with the Alpharma Group, or any entity therein, or the termination of your employment, prior to the date of this Letter Agreement (a "Claim").  This includes, without in any way limiting the foregoing language, any and all claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Reconstruction Era Civil Rights Act, as amended, the Family and Medical Le
ave Act of 1993, the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the United States Constitution, the Constitution of the State of Maryland and/or any and all other local, state or federal statute, law, order, rule, regulation or ordinance (including but not limited to labor, employment, benefit or wage matters), and/or any and all contract or tort claims.</LI>

<P>In consideration of the promises made by you in this Letter Agreement, the Alpharma Releasees hereby release you from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, expenses and liabilities, now known to the Alpharma Group, which they now have or may have against you which relate in any way to your employment with the Alpharma Group, or any entity therein, or the termination of your employment, prior to the date of this Letter Agreement</P>

<LI>In signing this Letter Agreement you represent that you have not filed any Claim against the Alpharma Releasees and hereby covenant not to file any such Claim.  You further agree that, in the event any Claim is brought by a governmental agency, this Letter Agreement shall serve as a complete defense to such Claim.  In signing this Letter Agreement the Company, on behalf of the Alpharma Releasees, represents that they have not filed any claim against you and hereby covenant not to file any such claim.</LI>

<LI>You agree that, prior to July 14,2002, you will not directly or indirectly engage in the business of producing, marketing or distributing non-branded generic pharmaceutical products (prescription or OTC) of the liquid or topical forms currently produced by the Alpharma Group within the United States (a "Competing Business").

You acknowledge and agree that the covenants set forth in this paragraph 5 are reasonable in scope, duration, geographic area and in all other respects.  You and the Alpharma Group further agree that if any of the provisions of this paragraph 5 shall be determined by any court or competent jurisdiction to be in
valid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, and such determination shall become final, such provision shall be deemed to be severed or limited, but only to the extent required to render the remaining provisions of this paragraph 5 enforceable. This paragraph 5 as thus amended shall be enforced to give effect to the intention of the parties insofar as that is possible.  You and the Alpharma Group acknowledge and you agree that if you are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have breached any covenant of this paragraph 5 all obligations of the Alpharma Group to pay compensation under paragraph 2 of this Agreement shall terminate.  </LI>

<LI>You and the Alpharma Group agree that in the event of any breach by either, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to its other rights and remedies, to enforce its rights under this Agreement by specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or future) of the provision of this Agreement.</LI>

<LI>The Alpharma Group agrees not to make any statement at any time which disparages you or the services you have provided for the Alpharma Group, and you agree not to make any statement at any time which disparages the Alpharma Group or its officers, directors or employees.  You agree not to disclose or use in any manner any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets regarding the Alpharma Group or its businesses, products, operations, technology or plans unless and until such information shall have become generally known to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or other action by you.</LI>

<LI>The Company will pay for executive outplacement services to be rendered by an outplacement firm selected by you and acceptable to the Company to assist you in obtaining further employment.  This engagement shall be for a period commencing on January 16, 2002 and ending on the earlier of (a) your acceptance of full time employment or (b) January 15, 2003.  The Company will pay all of the reasonable costs of such services as invoiced by the outplacement firm.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 8, the Company shall not be responsible for any of your personnel expenses associated with obtaining employment.  This Letter Agreement contains the entire agreement between you and the Alpharma Group with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings, written or oral.  You acknowledge that the Alpharma Group has made no warranties, promises or representations of any kind which you have relied in executing this Letter Agreement expect as specifically set forth
 herein.</LI>

<LI>If the Company should file for, or involuntarily be placed under, protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code, all payments due to you under this Letter Agreement shall be entitled to a priority to fullest extent permitted by applicable law; provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not affect the priority rights of secured debtors of the Company or its subsidiaries.   </LI>

<LI>You acknowledge that you have read this Letter Agreement carefully and understand all of its terms.  You understand that you have the right to obtain, and you acknowledge that you have obtained, legal counsel prior to signing this Letter Agreement and that you have been provided with reasonable time to obtain and consider such counsel.   You also understand that this Letter Agreement shall not be effective or enforceable and no payments shall be due hereunder until both (a) you sign and return the enclosed copy of this Letter Agreement to the Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of the Company and (b) 10 business days after the date you return a signed copy of this Letter Agreement have expired without you or your counsel giving written notice that you are revoking your acceptance of this Letter Agreement.  This Letter Agreement is open for acceptance by you until the close of business on November 30, 2001.</LI></OL>
