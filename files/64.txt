</FONT><U><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow" SIZE=3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P>GENERAL</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals.  The Company offers a comprehensive range of generic human pharmaceutical products in over 800 tablet, capsule, liquid and topical formulations and dosage forms.  It also manufacturers and markets animal health products in over 100  formulations and dosage forms.   The Company conducts business in more than 60 countries and has approximately 4,700 employees at 40 sites in 27 countries.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company generated revenue of approximately $1,238.0 million.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Formation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is incorporated in Delaware.  The Company was originally organized as A.L. Laboratories, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S., a Norwegian healthcare company (the predecessor company to A.L. Industrier ASA).  In 1994, the Company acquired the complementary human pharmaceutical and animal health business of its parent company and subsequently changed its name to Alpharma Inc. to operate worldwide as one corporate entity.   </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Controlling Stockholder</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier") beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock, or approximately 23% of the Company's total common stock outstanding at December 31, 2002.  The Class B common stock currently bears the right to elect more than a majority of the Company's Board of Directors and to cast a majority of the votes in any vote of the Company's stockholders.  Mr. Einar Sissener, Chairman of the Board of the Company and a controlling stockholder of Industrier, and members of his immediate family, also beneficially own 373,667 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.  As a result, Industrier, and ultimately Mr. Sissener, can control the Company. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financing Structures</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has in place the following debt facilities:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&#9;Senior Credit Facility (the "2001 Credit Facility")</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2001, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpharma Operating Corporation ("Alpharma Operating Corporation"), and certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with the Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions that provided up to a maximum of $900.0 million of secured senior credit  consisting of:</P></DIR>
</DIR>


<UL><DIR>
<DIR>


<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>a six year $300.0 million revolving credit facility;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>a six year $175.0 million term A loan; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>a seven-year $425.0 million term B loan.</LI></P></UL>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2002, approximately $480.0 million was outstanding under the 2001 Credit Facility.  As of that date, the Company had permanently repaid approximately $171.0 million of the term A and term B loans and voluntarily reduced the amount available under the revolving line of credit by $150.0 million pursuant to the terms of a December 2002 amendment to the 2001 Credit Facility, resulting in the maximum amount available to be borrowed under the 2001 Credit Facility being reduced to $579.0 million.  As of December 31, 2002, the unused portion of the revolver, as amended, was $99.0 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 2002, the Company and the relevant lenders signed an amendment to the 2001 Credit Facility that includes covenant relief and permits certain strategic initiatives, including plant closures and asset write-downs, and the permanent prepayment of certain debt under the 2001 Credit Facility.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)&#9;12% Senior Subordinated Notes</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2001, Alpharma Operating Corporation sold $200.0 million in principal amount of 12% senior subordinated notes (the "12% Notes") due 2009 to affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and CIBC World Markets Corp.  Pursuant to the terms of the 12% Notes, the Company is presently paying an effective interest rate of 12.5%.  The holders of the 12% Notes have the right to cause the Company to issue exchange notes, which can be sold to third parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes </P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 1998, the Company issued $125.0 million of 5.75% convertible subordinated notes (the "5.75% Notes") due 2005 of which $34.2 million remain outstanding after an exchange of $90.9 million principal amount of 5.75% Notes for 3,266,850 shares of the Company's Class A common stock in 2001 and 2002.  The Company incurred non-cash, pre-tax charges of approximately $21.0 million in connection with these exchanges.  The remaining 5.75% Notes may be converted into common stock at a conversion price of $28.594 per share at any time prior to maturity, subject to adjustment under certain conditions.  The Company may redeem the remaining 5.75% Notes, in whole or in part, at a premium plus accrued interest.  Concurrently with the Company's issuance of the 5.75% Notes in March 1998, Industrier, the controlling stockholder of the Company, purchased approximately $67.9 million principal amount of a 5.75% convertible subordinated note (the "Industrier Note").  In connection with the Company's fi
nancing of the acquisition of the oral solid dose pharmaceutical business from Mayne Nickless in 2001 ("Faulding Acquisition") (See "U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals - Acquisitions"), the Industrier Note was converted into 2,372,897 shares of Class B common stock of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Industrier Note. </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv)&#9;3.0% Convertible Subordinated Notes </P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 1999, the Company issued $170.0 million principal amount of 3.0% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2006 (the "3% Notes") of which $122.0 million remain outstanding.  The Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax charge of approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2002 in connection with the exchange of $53.4 million in principal amount of the 3% Notes for 3,433,104 shares of the Company's Class A common stock.  The remaining 3% Notes pay cash interest of 3% per annum, calculated on the initial principal amount of the 3% Notes.  The remaining 3% Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into 31.1429 shares of the Company's Class A common stock per one thousand dollars of initial principal amount of 3% Notes.  The 3% Notes will mature at a price of 134.104% of the initial principal amount.  the payment of the principal amount of the 3% Notes at maturity (or earlier, if the 3% Notes are redeemed by the Company prior to maturity), t
ogether with cash interest paid over the term of the 3% Notes, will yield investors 6.875% per annum.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">De-leveraging Strategy</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To better assure the Company's continued debt covenant compliance and to increase operating flexibility, the Company has implemented a strategy to de-leverage its balance sheet.  Pursuant to this strategy, in 2002 the Company undertook a series of initiatives which included expense, capital spending and working capital controls and a focus on increasing free cash flow.  In 2002, the Company exchanged $110.0 million of its 5% Notes and 3% Notes for the Company's Class A common stock as described above, and through its focus on managing its working capital generated $162.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities.  Primarily, as a result of these actions the Company was able to reduce its outstanding debt in 2002 by $164.7 million.  The Company intends to continue its focus on free cash flow in 2003.  In addition, the Company is continuing to evaluate possible sale of assets but has made no decision with respect to any material divestiture.  The Company may also issue additio
nal common stock for cash or in exchange for existing debt.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Management and Financial Reporting Structure</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company operates in the human and animal pharmaceuticals industries.  For financial reporting purposes it has four businesses within these industries: Animal Health, U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals, International Generics and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients.  International Generics was formerly called International Pharmaceuticals.  The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients business was formerly called Fine Chemicals.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2002, International Generics ("IG") and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API") were managed by a single management team as part of Human Pharmaceuticals International ("HPI").  In addition, commencing in January 2003, the three human pharmaceutical business segments, U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"), International Generics and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, were realigned as one Human Pharmaceuticals organization.  As part of the realignment, USHP was divided into two separate operational units called U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, and key global management roles were developed to oversee business development, supply chain, scientific affairs and compliance functions.  For management purposes, HPI, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals and each global function are now managed by individual management teams.  The IG, API and USHP businesses have remained separate businesses for financial reporting purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2001, the Aquatic Animal Health Division became a part of Animal Health and, for all management and financial purposes, since 2001, has not been reported as a separate business segment.  </P>

<B><U><P>NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Human Pharmaceuticals</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's Human Pharmaceuticals business is comprised of the U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals and Human Pharmaceuticals International businesses.  The U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business is comprised of the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals businesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Pharmaceuticals International business is comprised of the International Generics and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients businesses.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A single integrated management team commenced managing the International Generics and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients business units, as a single unit, Human Pharmaceuticals International, in October 2001.  In January of 2003, Human Pharmaceuticals International and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals were reorganized into a business unit called Human Pharmaceuticals.  In February 2003, the Human Pharmaceuticals organization was further realigned to maximize operational efficiencies.  As part of this realignment, the Company divided U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals into two separate operational units called U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals.  Additionally, key global roles were developed to oversee business development, supply chain, scientific affairs and compliance.  The managers of each of the Human Pharmaceuticals International, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals businesses in addition to the four global roles, now report directly to the Compan
y's Chief Executive Officer. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2002, the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals business had sales of approximately $918.3 million.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets its primary products, generic pharmaceuticals, through its International Generics and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals businesses.  The Human Pharmaceuticals business also markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals through its U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business and, in certain international markets, through its Human Pharmaceuticals International business.  In addition, the Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets a line of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  Through acquisitions, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">International Generics ("IG") </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IG develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceuticals for human use.  The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of generic oral solid dose pharmaceuticals in Europe, with a substantial presence in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.  IG also has a growing presence in Southeast Asia.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product Lines</I>.  IG manufactures and markets prescription and over-the-counter products using approximately 250 APIs that are sold primarily in approximately 670 different formulations and dosage forms including tablets, capsules, ointments, creams, liquids, suppositories and injections.  This includes generic products in approximately 500 tablet and capsule formulations and dosages, approximately 60 liquid formulations and dosages, approximately 60 cream and ointment formulations and dosages for topical use, and approximately 50 injectable formulations and dosages.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IG's European sales of generic pharmaceuticals in 2002 increased due to strong sales in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and the UK.  However, these sales were partially offset by price erosion in the UK and the Netherlands.  The addition of Chinese sales as a result of the Faulding Acquisition and favorable foreign currency changes also added to IG's increase in sales.  </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prescription Pharmaceuticals</I></U>.  IG has regulatory approvals for approximately 200 prescription products, with a total of approximately 570 formulations and dosage strengths.  IG's prescription products comprise a broad product line, concentrating on antibiotic, analgesic/antirheumatic, psychotropic cardiovascular, cough and cold, and corticosteroid therapeutic areas.  These products are predominantly sold on a generic basis. </P>
<I><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over-the-Counter Products</I></U>.  IG has regulatory approvals for approximately 45 over-the-counter products, with a total of approximately 100 formulations and dosage strengths.  IG has a broad range of products in different product categories including skin care, gastrointestinal care and pain relief.  Its range of products also includes vitamins, fluoride tablets, adhesive bandages and surgical tapes, among others.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Acquisitions and Divestitures</I>.  In May 1998, the Company acquired Arthur H. Cox and Co. Ltd. (renamed Alpharma Limited), one of the leading generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United Kingdom, from Hoechst AG for a purchase price of approximately $198.0 million.  Alpharma Limited manufactures and markets tablets, capsules, suppositories, liquids, ointments and creams.  Alpharma Limited's main operations, which consist primarily of a manufacturing plant, warehousing facilities and a sales organization, are located in Barnstaple, England.  Alpharma Limited distributes its products to pharmacy retailers and pharmaceuticals wholesalers, primarily in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, in November 1998 and April 1999, in substantially smaller transactions, the Company acquired generic pharmaceutical product lines in Germany and France.  All of the products purchased in these transactions are manufactured under long-term contracts with third parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 1999, the Company acquired a market presence in the German generic market through the purchase of the Isis group of companies, (renamed Alpharma-ISIS GmbH &amp; Co. KG) ("Alpharma-ISIS"), from Schwarz Pharma AG for a purchase price of approximately $153.0 million.  Alpharma-ISIS has a substantial marketing organization but no manufacturing operations.  All products are manufactured for Alpharma-ISIS by third parties, including a substantial number under a supply agreement with Schwarz Pharma that expires in 2008 (with annual renewal rights upon mutual agreement of the parties).  Approximately 75% of Alpharma-ISIS' sales are of cardiovascular products, the most important of which in terms of sales is the drug Pentalong.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 2001, as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired 90% of Alpharma (Foshan) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (formerly Foshan Faulding Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.) ("Alpharma Foshan").  A corporation controlled by the government of the City of Foshan owns the remaining 10% of Alpharma Foshan.  Alpharma Foshan manufactures and distributes generic oral pharmaceutical products in the southern and eastern portions of China.  (See "U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals - Acquisitions" for a discussion of the Faulding acquisition.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2003, the Company divested its vitamin business to Nopal AS ("Nopal"), a subsidiary of Industrier, the Company's controlling stockholder, for approximately $3.3 million.  In connection with this sale, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Nopal pursuant to which the Company will supply Nopal with certain vitamin products, and two distribution agreements with Nopal pursuant to which Nopal will continue to sell the Company's medical plaster and tape products to the grocery sector and the Company will sell Nopal's acquired vitamin products to the pharmacy and health care sector.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities</I>.  The Company maintains six manufacturing facilities for its IG products, all of which also house administrative offices and warehouse space.  The Company's plants in Lier, Norway and Barnstaple, England, include many technologically advanced applications for the manufacturing of tablet, liquid and ointment products.  The Company's plant in Copenhagen, Denmark manufactures a limited number of sterile finished pharmaceutical products.  In addition to the Lier, Barnstaple and Copenhagen facilities, the Company also operates plants in Vennesla, Norway, for bandages and surgical tape products, and Jakarta, Indonesia, for tablets, ointments and liquids.  The Jakarta plant exports certain products to Europe.  Through Alpharma Foshan, the Company also operates a manufacturing plant in Foshan City in the Guangdong Province of China.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1998, the Company (i) consolidated its international tablet, ointment and liquid production by transferring its production operations from Copenhagen to the Lier facility and third-party manufacturers and (ii) consolidated its sterile production by transferring its production operations from Norway to the Copenhagen facility and to third-party manufacturers.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition</I>.  Most of the Company's international finished pharmaceutical products compete with one or more other products that contain the same active ingredient in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company therefore competes on the basis of price, product range, service and brand.  In European countries in recent years, sales of generic pharmaceuticals have been increasing relative to sales of patent-protected pharmaceuticals.  Generics are gaining market share on a volume basis because, among other things, governments are attempting to reduce pharmaceutical expenses by enacting regulations that promote the use of generic pharmaceuticals in lieu of more expensive branded formulations.  The Company's international generic products also encounter competition from imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws promoting free movement of goods.  It is also encountering increased pressure from new entrants into the market who are able to supply p
roduct at lower prices.  The Company is considering moving production to, or sourcing products from suppliers in, lower cost territories to meet this competitive force.  To remain competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market, it is also critical that scheduled product launches enter the market on time.  Additionally, in certain EU jurisdictions such as the U.K. and Germany, maximum pricing legislation is resulting in lower prices and impacting the Company's ability to compete on the basis of price in such jurisdictions.  In certain EU jurisdictions such as France, proposed legislation is under review which, if adopted, would introduce a system of reference pricing which may similarly put downward pressure on pricing of the Company's products and would have the effect of removing a significant number of the Company's products from eligibility for government reimbursement in these jurisdictions.  (See "Government Regulation" and "Risk Factors".) </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Geographic Markets</I>.  The principal geographic markets for IG's products are the United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands, France, the Nordic countries and other Western European countries, Indonesia, China and the Middle East.  Additionally, the Company has sales in select other Asian and African markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales and Distribution and Customers</I>.  Depending on the characteristics of each geographic market, IG's products are predominantly marketed under either brand or generic names.  Over-the-counter products are typically marketed under brand names with concentration on skin care, pain relief and vitamins.  IG's primary customers are integrated wholesalers (wholesale and retail outlets), pharmacy retail chains, purchasing organizations and government entities.  To position itself towards the integrated wholesalers who are gradually becoming significant Pan-European parties, IG is targeting both the local market organizations and the corporate offices of these customers.  IG employs a specialized marketing and sales force of approximately 550 persons (with the largest being 180 in Indonesia, 75 in China and 150 in Germany) that markets and promotes generic pharmaceuticals to doctors, hospitals, wholesalers, pharmacies and consumers.  In each of the Company's international markets, it use
s wholesalers to distribute its generic pharmaceutical products.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's API business develops, manufactures and markets a range of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products.  The Company's API business benefits from over four decades of experience in the use and development of fermentation and purification technology.  Additionally, The Company's API business' fermentation expertise in the production of bulk antibiotics has a direct technological application to the manufacture of products for the Company's animal pharmaceuticals business.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product Lines.  </I>The Company's API business markets and sells approximately 10 APIs in 28 grades.  APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections.  The Company is the world's leading producer of bacitracin and polymyxin, and a leading producer of vancomycin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics.  The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotics such as amphotericin B parenteral grade and colistin for injectable use and use in specialized topical and surgical human applications.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is expanding certain of its facilities in order to address capacity constraints with respect to some of the products in its API business' portfolio.  (See "Facilities" below.)  In February 2003, the Company's API business implemented a significant price increase targeted at certain of its products.  The impact of this price increase will be influenced by customer inventory levels and customer response.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities.  </I>The Company manufactures its API products in its plants in Oslo, Norway, which also manufactures products for the Company's Animal Health business; Copenhagen, Denmark, which also manufactures finished products for IG; and Budapest, Hungary.  Each plant includes fermentation, specialized recovery and purification equipment.  To support the production of vancomycin, the Company substantially expanded its production capacity at its Copenhagen facility and acquired a facility in Budapest, Hungary in December 1998.  An expansion of manufacturing processes and capacity at the Budapest facility is substantially complete.  (See "Information Applicable to all Business Segments- Environmental Compliance" for a discussion of an administrative action related to the Budapest facility.)  The Oslo and Copenhagen facilities have been classified as acceptable by the FDA as a manufacturer of certain sterile and non-sterile bulk antibiotics.  Such FDA classification allows imports of the
se products into the U.S. market and by the health authorities of most European countries.  The Company is continuing to expand its facility in Copenhagen to increase its capacity.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition.  </I>In sales to large and small customers, price, quality and service are the determining factors.  The Company believes that its fermentation and purification expertise and established reputation provide it with a significant advantage in these antibiotic products.  While the Company does not anticipate any immediate competitive effect as a result of its recent price increase on certain API products, competition might increase in the future as a result.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Geographic Markets.</I>  The Company's API business sells its active pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and other areas of the world.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, sales in North America of API products represented approximately 63% of the Company's API business' total revenues with significant additional sales of products in Europe, Asia and Latin America.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales and Distribution and Customers.  </I>Sales of bulk antibiotic products are made to relatively few large customers, primarily pharmaceutical companies making generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products.  The Company distributes and sells its API products in North America and Europe using its own sales force.  Sales of the Company's API products in other parts of the world are primarily through the use of local agents and distributors. </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3 COLOR="#ffffff"> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business develops, manufactures, markets and distributes generic prescription, specialty branded and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals for human use.  With products in over 200 formulations and dosage forms, USHP is a market leader in generic solid, liquid and topical dosage forms, with what the Company believes to be one of the broadest portfolios of these dosage forms in the generic pharmaceuticals industry.  With the addition of Purepac, an oral solid dose pharmaceutical business purchased as part of the Faulding Acquisition completed in 2001, the Company's liquid and topical customers can buy a broadened product line from the Company, instead of having to purchase oral solid dose pharmaceuticals from other vendors.  The Company expects that this broadened product offering will continue to strengthen its competitive position and increase its market share in the U.S.  In 2002, however, USHP ceased producing a number of less profitable products in order t
o concentrate on more profitable products while maintaining one of the broadest portfolios in the generic pharmaceutical industry.  It is anticipated that USHP will continue to review its product portfolio and take actions designed to improve profitability.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2002, USHP reported significantly higher revenues due to the inclusion of the oral solid dose pharmaceutical business which was acquired  as part of the Faulding acquisition.  Increases due to the acquired business were partially offset by weakness in USHP's liquid business due to lower production at the Company's Baltimore facility where remediation efforts are ongoing.  (See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the remediation corrective action plans for the Baltimore and Elizabeth plants and "Legal Proceedings".)</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product Lines</I>.  USHP manufactures and markets products using approximately 165 APIs that are sold in over 200 different formulations and dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, creams, ointments, suppositories and liquid inhalants, in its line of over-the-counter and prescription medications.  The experience and technical expertise of USHP enables it to formulate immediate and modified release medications in oral solid dosage forms.  It also enables USHP to develop therapeutic equivalent drugs in liquid and topical forms, and refine product characteristics, such as taste, texture and appearance in the case of liquid forms, and color, texture and consistency in the case of topical forms.  USHP manufactures and markets generic prescription products in approximately 88 tablet and capsule formulations and dosages.  The Company believes it is the leading U.S. manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products in liquid form with approximately 38 formulations and dosages.  USHP m
anufactures approximately 50 generic cream, lotion and ointment formulations and dosages for topical use.  USHP also markets a line of respiratory products and unit does liquids products consisting of 16 formulations and dosages.  USHP also manufactures and markets two branded prescription drug products in tablet and capsule dosage forms.  </P><DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic Prescription Pharmaceuticals</I>.  USHP has regulatory approvals for approximately 130 generic prescription products with a total of approximately 176 dosage strengths.  The prescription products consist of a broad line of specialty liquid products for approximately 12 different indications, including cough/cold, allergy and respiratory, a broad line of creams and ointments with a concentration on first aid medications, and a broad line of oral solid dose products with a concentration on modified release formulations in a variety of therapeutic categories including cardiovascular, anti-depressants, tranquilizers and analgesics. USHP's most successful generic drugs in 2002 were (i) diltiazem, the oral solid dose generic equivalent of Cardizem CD (indicated for the treatment of hypertension and chronic, stable angina), (ii) promethazine syrup, the liquid generic equivalent of Phenergan syrup (indicated for the treatment of seasonal or perennial rhinitis) and (iii) metformin HCI ta
blets, the oral solid dose generic equivalent of Glucophage (indicated as an adjunct to diet to lower blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics).</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over-the-Counter Pharmaceuticals.</I>  USHP has the ability to manufacture ANDA and non-ANDA over-the-counter products.  In 2002, USHP discontinued production of certain lower margin over-the-counter products in order to focus on higher margin products.  In the over-the-counter line, USHP has a broad range of products for approximately 12 different indications including allergy, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, cough/cold, first aid, feminine hygiene, nutritional and personal hair care. In addition, USHP sells Feverall, an over-the-counter suppository form of acetaminophen used for fever reduction and pain relief. The Company acquired the marketing and distribution rights for this product from a third party in December 2000.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Branded Pharmaceutical Products.</I>  USHP's branded pharmaceuticals business, which was founded as a part of F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited in 1998, markets two specialty brand name pharmaceuticals.  USHP's primary branded product is Kadian. a sustained release morphine product which USHP licenses from F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mayne Nickless Limited) pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license. USHP also sells Serax brand capsules and tablets, an anti-anxiety product, for which the Company acquired the marketing and distribution rights from a third party in November 1999.  The U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business has a sales force of approximately 100 people.  USHP focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the medical specialists who are likely to be the most active writers of prescriptions for its products.  In addition to its sales and marketing efforts the Company continues to seek product development and co-promotion opportunities with 
other pharmaceutical companies to enhance its product portfolio and to expand the scope of its efforts.  However, no assurances can be given that such partnerships will be successfully created.  </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Acquisitions</I>. In December 2001, as a result of the Faulding acquisition, the Company acquired U.S. based Purepac Pharmaceutical Co., a company specializing in the development, manufacture and marketing of generic oral solid dose pharmaceuticals, and Faulding Laboratories Inc., a company specializing in the marketing and distribution of branded pharmaceuticals, and China based Alpharma Foshan Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., a manufacturer and distributor of generic oral pharmaceuticals.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities.  </I>USHP maintains and operates three manufacturing facilities, with a fourth facility expected to be operational during 2003, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and two automated central distribution centers.  USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid and nasal spray pharmaceuticals.  (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".)  The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories.  As a result of the Faulding acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, which is in the validation process for future manufacturing and the Company expects will begin to be utilized for manufacturing purposes during 2003.  (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".)  The Company 
operates a distribution facility in Columbia, Maryland and is presently closing a similar facility in Memphis, Tennessee.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition.  </I>Legislation in the U.S. encourages the use of generics as an alternative to brand drugs, including the use of generics in the Medicaid reimbursement program, and generally allows  pharmacy substitution of brand drugs with generic drugs.  Nevertheless, while the Company is a market leader in the U.S. in the manufacture and marketing of specialty human generic pharmaceuticals, it operates in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company competes in this business on the basis of price, product range and service.  The Company competes with other generic pharmaceutical companies and with the generic drug divisions of major international branded drug companies that sell one or more products similar to the Company's products.  (See "Risk Factors" and  "Legal Proceedings - Gabapentin".) Additionally, it encounters market entry resistance from patented drug manufacturers.  The Company selectively attempts to introduce generic drugs, as it is currently attempting wi
th gabapentin, earlier than the last expiration date for patents held by the manufacturer holding the patent protection through the process of designing around existing patents or challenging patents believed to be invalid or unenforceable.  The Company has encountered vigorous challenges to these activities that have resulted in significant legal costs as it has defended its right to market these products.  The Company expects to face further legal costs as it continues to defend such challenges.  The Company might be unsuccessful in defending these challenges.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business also operates in a highly competitive, price sensitive market.  The Company's U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals products compete with products manufactured by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and worldwide research-based brand drug companies.  As the Company grows this business, it expects to encounter continued competition.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales and Distribution.  </I>The Company has a sales organization with approximately 176 employees dedicated to USHP's generic and branded pharmaceutical products, including direct sales forces and telemarketing operations.  The Company<I> </I>maintains a professional direct sales force of approximately 6 employees to direct market USHP's generic products and approximately 100 employees to distribute and direct market USHP's branded products.  In addition, the Company's advanced telemarketing operation, which employs approximately 70 sales and supervisory personnel, markets and distributes generic products manufactured by third parties and, to a limited extent, USHP.  The Company has recently increased the use of its telemarketing operations for the sale of its own products by adding a dedicated facility for this expanded activity.  This business also provides certain custom marketing services, such as order processing and distribution, to the pharmaceutical and certain other industries
.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Customers.  </I>USHP sells pharmaceutical products to the primary customers within the pharmaceutical industry, such as warehousing and non-warehousing chains, as well as wholesalers, hospitals, long-term care providers, managed care providers and mail order companies.  The Company has no long-term agreements with any of these accounts, which may reduce or cease their purchases from the Company at any time in the future.  Any cessation or material reduction of these customers' purchases would likely have a material effect on the Company's sales and profitability.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Animal Health ("AH")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company believes that its Animal Health business is a global leader in the development, registration, manufacturing and marketing of medicated feed additives ("MFAs") for food producing animals including poultry, cattle, swine and  farmed fish.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, AH had  product sales of approximately $321.9 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH's financial performance in 2002 was adversely affected as a result of (i) a change in its business practices initiated in the fourth quarter of 2001, as distributors reduced their inventory levels, (ii) declining swine product sales caused by market conditions, which included lower swine prices due to competitive generic activity and an excess supply of animals, (iii) impairment charges for Reporcin and goodwill, (iv) restructuring costs associated with plant closings and (v) economic instability in Latin American markets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2002, Animal Health implemented a new business strategy that included strengthening customer and market focus and significantly improving working capital management.  As an additional part of AH's strategy, it  conducted a review of its product pipeline relating to Reporcin, which resulted in the decision to cease further investment in the construction of a U.S. production facility for the product in Terre Haute, Indiana.  Additionally, it conducted an evaluation of its major contractual supplier relationships that has resulted in the termination or amendment of certain long-term relationships with suppliers.  In 2002, the Company also determined that consolidation of existing manufacturing activity was necessary, resulting in the closure of its manufacturing facilities in Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, and  Parkville, Australia, and its research center in Wrightstown, New Jersey.  While AH intends to complete these actions in 2003, write-offs and other charges against pre-ta
x income of approximately $152.1 million were recorded in 2002 in connection with such matters.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product Lines.  </I>The Company's principal animal health business is based on a portfolio of anti-infective pharmaceutical products that are added to the feed and water of livestock and poultry.  This market is comprised of three primary pharmaceutical categories: antibiotics, antibacterials and anticoccidials.  </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Antibiotics</U>.  The Company's MFAs and water-soluble products are used to prevent and treat diseases and promote growth in poultry, swine and cattle.  The Company is the world's largest supplier of bacitracin and chlortetracycline for use in animal feeds.  The Company's major animal health antibiotic products include:</P></DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anticoccidials</U>.  These products are used to prevent coccidiosis, a condition caused by an intestinal parasite that affects growth in poultry and cattle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the Company's antibiotic, antibacterial and anticoccidial pharmaceutical products, it also sells:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>water soluble vitamins, minerals and electrolytes that are used as nutritional supplements for poultry, swine and cattle, and to treat some conditions in baby pigs and calves; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>injectable and immersion vaccines and treatments for farmed fish, such as Alpha Ject, Alpha Dip and Alpha Max.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pharmaceuticals for animals (including animal vaccines) must be reviewed and receive registration from the FDA and USDA for marketing in the United States and approval or registration by similar regulatory agencies in other countries.  Regulatory approvals for products to be used in food producing animals are complex due to the possible impact on humans. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approval also must be granted in the U.S. for the use of a pharmaceutical product in combination with other pharmaceuticals.  Such combination approval generally requires the cooperation of other manufacturers.  To date, the Company has been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many of its products.  These combination clearances significantly extend the reach and potential market share of the Company's products and provide a considerable competitive advantage.  Presently, the Company has sponsored a total of approximately 85 combination approvals in the U.S.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Acquisitions</I>.  In 1999, the Company purchased the assets of I.D. Russell Company Laboratories, a manufacturer of a line of soluble antibiotics and vitamins.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, the Company acquired exclusive marketing rights to Reporcin, a performance and meat quality improvement product for injectable use in swine, pursuant to a technology license and option agreement.  Sales of Reporcin are ongoing in some countries, including Mexico and Brazil, which have substantial swine populations.  However, the full realization of the potential for Reporcin is dependent upon market acceptance in those two countries and governmental license approvals and market acceptance in numerous other countries, including the U.S.  The agreement requires payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets or payment of a liquidated damages fee for not pursuing licenses in such countries equal to 10% of the product license payment that would otherwise have become due upon receipt of the product license.  As of December 31, 2002, total additional payments of approximately $35.0 million are required over the next four  years if all seven p
ossible country approvals are received.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin.  To meet this requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June 2000 and began preparing the facility for production of Reporcin.  Due to a reassessment of the Company's approach to the U.S. market for Reporcin, the facility, on which the Company has expended $12 million, has not been completed and the Company has announced its intention to sell this facility in 2003.  Additionally, due to excess inventory of Reporcin, the Company has decided to cease manufacturing at its Parkville, Australia facility.  In the third quarter of 2002, the Company determined that certain tangible and intangible assets related to Reporcin were impaired and recorded a pre-tax charge of $37.1 million.  As part of its reassessment, the Company intends to investigate toll manufacturing opportunities for the U.S. marke
t and to continue to pursue regulatory approval for Reporcin in the U.S. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In May 2000, the Company purchased the Roche MFA business for approximately $288.0 million.  The Roche MFA business consisted of products including Aureomycin, Bovatec, Avatec, Bio-Cox and Cygro.  These pharmaceuticals are used to prevent and treat diseases in livestock and poultry.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facilities.  </I>The Company produces its Animal Health products in several manufacturing facilities.  BMD is produced and blended at the Company's Chicago Heights, Illinois facility, which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant.  Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility, which is shared with HPI.  Soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH's Longmont, Colorado facility and feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH's Willow Island, West Virginia facility in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers.  It is then blended at independent blending facilities.  Bio-Cox is blended in AH's Van Buren, Arkansas facility, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at its Salisbury, Maryland facility.  The 3-Nitro product line  is manufactured using the Company's technology at a third party facility.  In 2002, the Company commenced manufacturing Lasalocid test batches at its Willow Island facility.  Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in 
accordance with an agreement that expires in 2012 using the Company's technology at a facility owned and operated by a third party.  Blending of Deccox is done at the Company's Lowell, Arkansas facility  (until June 2003) and a third party facility.  Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities.  The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production.  The Company has announced that it will be closing its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and Wrightstown, New Jersey.  Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required.  </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Competition.  </I>The Company competes in this highly competitive, price sensitive business on the basis of price, brand name and customer service.  Some of the Company's competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities.  Due to the Company's strong market position in feed additives and its experience in obtaining requisite FDA approvals for combination therapies, the Company believes it enjoys a competitive advantage in commercializing FDA-approved combination medicated animal feed additives.  However, no assurances can be given that third parties will continue to cooperate in seeking combination approval for the Company's products, and the Company expects new entrants in the generic medicated animal feed additive market in 2003. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Geographic Markets.  </I>The Company sells a major portion of its animal health products in the U.S.  With the addition of the Roche MFA business, AH has expanded its international presence.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products in Norway, the United Kingdom, U.S., Chile and other international markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales and Distribution.  </I>The Company's animal health products in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and other selected markets are sold through a staff of 141 technically trained sales and service employees, many of whom are veterinarians and nutritionists.  The Company has sales offices in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Thailand, China, Brazil, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Australia.  In the remainder of the world, AH's products are sold primarily through the use of distributors and sales companies.  In January 1999, the Company combined its wholly-owned U.S. distribution company with two similar third party distribution businesses to form a joint venture 50% owned by the Company.  The joint venture is a regional distributor of animal health products in the Central Southwest and Eastern regions of the U.S.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products through its own technically-trained sales staff in Norway, the United Kingdom and C
hile and through distributors in other markets.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Customers.  </I>Sales are made principally to commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and integrated cattle, swine and poultry producers.  Although AH is not dependent on any one customer, the customer base for AH products is in a consolidation phase.  Therefore, as consolidation continues, the Company may become more dependent on certain individual customers as these customers increase their size and market share.  The Company sells its aquatic animal health products to fish farms, usually under a contract that extends for at least one growing season.  There are relatively few customers for the Company's aquatic animal health products and there are relatively few suppliers of the products that the Company sells in this market.  </P>
<B><U><P>Information Applicable to all Business Segments</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research, Product Development and Technical Activities</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments.  The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs.  Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques.  The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products.  In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's technical development activities for animal pharmaceuticals previously involved extensive product development and testing for the primary purpose of establishing clinical support for new products and additional uses for variations of existing products and seeking related FDA and other governmental approvals.  The Company is focusing its AH product development spending in 2003 on activities such as in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the Company's global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>capitalize on the globalized human pharmaceutical research and development function in order to be more efficient in the scope of research activities, including the distribution of  research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.  Accordingly, upon integration of the Company's three business segments into two segments, research and development will be conducted on a two segment basis.  The Company conducts its technical product development activities at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Baltimore, Maryland; Willow Island, West Virginia; Chicago Heights, Illinois and Elizabeth, New Jersey, as well as through independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe.  The Copenhagen facility is used for API research and development.  The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001.  The Company is in the process of closing its facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development expenses (which exclude legal fees) were approximately $67.1 million, $86.7 million and $43.3 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding acquisition.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development activities are inherently speculative.  Money spent on research and development does not always result in the successful development of a product.  For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the Company determines that it was not the first company to file a paragraph IV application for the related drug.  Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Product Pipeline</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company believes it has an attractive pipeline of new products that it plans to introduce over the next several years.  One of the most potentially significant of these products is USHP's generic form of gabapentin.  Gabapentin is a generic version of Neurontin, a drug indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, which had 2002 brand sales of over  $2.0 billion.  In January 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that  Purepac  was the first generic manufacturer to file a paragraph IV certification challenging the patents protecting Neurontin capsules.  As the first entity to file a paragraph IV certification with respect to the primary continuing gabapentin patents, the Company is in a position to benefit from generic market exclusivity for up to six months.  Exclusivity is subject to receipt of all required FDA approvals and the satisfactory resolution of the brand company's litigation challenge at the beginning of the exclusivity period.  The Company may not, in all cir
cumstances, be able to control the commencement of the exclusivity period and therefore can give no assurance that it will benefit from being the first to file the paragraph IV certification.  If the Company gains this exclusivity, based upon the results of similar generic product launches in the past, the Company believes it can reasonably expect a significant initial market share (as much as 25-50% of the brand market on a volume basis) and such initial sales should also assist the Company in retaining a smaller, but leading, market share after the exclusivity period.  However, the Company cannot assure that it will attain these results.  (See "Risk Factors" and "Legal Proceedings - Gabapentin".)</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government Regulation </P>
</B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General.  </I>The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other government agencies and by comparable authorities in the EU, Norway, Indonesia and other countries.  Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is a member of the European Economic Area and, as such, has accepted all EU regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals except in the area of feed antibiotics.  Government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, civil 
or criminal fines, actions, including prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and distribution, suspension or withdrawal of product approvals, the Company's debarment or the debarment of individuals from obtaining new drug approvals or providing services to drug companies in any capacity, refusal of the government to approve new products or to purchase the Company's products and criminal prosecution.  The cost of complying with government regulations substantially increases the cost of producing the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements (including the possibility of future changes in statutes or regulations), the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and analogous state and foreign agencies, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time the Company will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite the Company's efforts to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.  As a result of actions the Company has taken to respond to the progressively more demanding regulatory environment in which the Company operates, the Company has spent, and will continue to spend, significant funds and management time on regulatory compliance.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product Marketing Authority.  </I>In the U.S., the FDA regulatory procedure generally applicable to human generic pharmaceutical products depends on whether the branded drug to which the generic version is equivalent or comparable is:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the subject of an approved New Drug Application, or NDA, which has been reviewed for both safety and effectiveness;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>marketed under a pre-1962 NDA reviewed for safety only;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>marketed without an NDA; or</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>marketed pursuant to over-the-counter monograph program.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the drug to be offered is a generic variation of a branded product that is the subject of an NDA approved for both safety and effectiveness, the generic product must be the subject of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, and be approved by the FDA prior to marketing.  Drug products which are generic copies of the other types of branded products generally may be marketed in accordance with either FDA enforcement policies or the over-the-counter drug monograph program which describes  active ingredients and labeled uses the FDA has determined are safe and effective and do not require NDA approval and generally are not subject to ANDA filings and approval prior to market introduction at this time.  While the Company believes that the Company's current pharmaceutical products are appropriately marketed under the applicable FDA procedure or current enforcement policy, the basis for marketing products not covered by approved ANDAs is subject to change or revocation by the FDA.  The s
tatus of all products is also subject to change if experience reveals significant new adverse information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All applications for regulatory approval of generic drug products subject to ANDA requirements must contain data relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and quality control, among other information.  ANDAs also must contain data demonstrating the bioequivalence of the generic drug to the branded drug.  Each product approval limits manufacturing to a specifically identified site or sites.  Supplemental filings to allow the manufacture of products at new sites also generally require review and approval.  In addition, certain changes to our manufacturing process, drug ingredients and labeling also can require regulatory review and approval.  New product approvals or approvals to change products might not be obtained in a timely manner, if ever.  Failure to obtain these approvals, or to obtain them when expected, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the Company's animal pharmaceuticals are regulated by the FDA, similarly to the human pharmaceuticals, while other animal pharmaceuticals are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Although the Company markets some generic animal pharmaceuticals, which are subject to similar FDA requirements as applicable to its human generic pharmaceutical products, many of its animal pharmaceuticals are considered to be branded or pioneer animal drug products.  Like their human counterparts, pre-marketing approval under stringent FDA rules for their testing, development, and manufacture is required for animal drugs as well as for any changes in label claims, specifications or manufacturing sites that occur post-approval.  The enormous backlog of submissions pending review in FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine has made the timing of such approvals difficult to predict.  Despite the difficulty and delays brought about by this situation, the Company has been successful in obtaining such
 approvals.  As with human pharmaceutical products, FDA inspection and record keeping requirements as well as debarment provisions apply to the Company's Animal Health products.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislative bills are introduced in the U.S. Congress from time to time, some of which, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on AH's business.  However, in the past, such bills that could have had a material adverse effect, have not had sufficient support to become law.  The animal pharmaceutical industry is actively engaged in the legislative process.  To address the previously mentioned review backlog, the industry is supporting legislation that would adopt user fees and performance standards similar to those in place for new human drugs and medical devices.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EU legislation requires that medical products for human use must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the EU.  The criteria upon which grant of an authorization is assessed are quality, safety and efficacy.  Demonstration of safety and efficacy in particular requires clinical trials on human subjects, which are subject to the standards codified in the EU guideline on Good Clinical Practice.  In addition, the EU legislation requires that such trials be preceded by adequate pharmacological and toxicological tests in animals, that stability tests are to be carried out, that clinical trials use controls and that clinical trials be carried out double blind and be capable of statistical analysis by using specific criteria wherever possible, rather than relying on a large sample size.  The working party on the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products has also made various recommendations in this area.  Analogous governmental and agency approvals are similarly 
required in other countries where the Company conducts business.  There can be no assurance that new product approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, if ever.  Failure to obtain these approvals, or to obtain them when expected, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similar requirements apply to the granting of marketing authorizations for medicinal products for veterinary use in EU countries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic medicinal products for human and veterinary use may be authorized in the EU through abridged authorization applications.  For example, the EU marketing authorization applications do not need to contain results of toxicological and pharmacological tests and results of clinical trials provided that certain conditions are met, and in particular that the "original" medicinal product has been authorized in the EU for at least six years (and in certain cases ten years) and has been in the market in the member state where the marketing authorization application has  been submitted.  Abridged applications must refer to information contained in the dossier of the "original" product for which a marketing authorization has been granted on the basis of a complete dossier.  The original complete dossier in question must be a dossier at the disposal of the competent authority concerned.  This implies that abridged applications must be lodged with the authorities that actually hold the dossier fo
r the "original" product.  The "original" product referred to must still be authorized at the time of the abridged application is submitted.  To qualify for abridged dossiers, the product must be considered as "essentially similar" to the original medicinal product.  There is no EU definition of this "essentially similar" condition.  Based on the interpretation of the European Court of Justice, a medicinal product is deemed "essentially similar" to the original product when it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active principles/substances, the same pharmaceutical form and is bioequivalent unless it is apparent in the light of scientific knowledge that it differs significantly from the original product regarding safety or efficacy. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Numerous proposals for revising the EU legislation are under consideration.  These proposals would affect the regulation of both human and veterinary drug products.  No modifications to the legislation have been adopted at this time.  The Company cannot predict what, if any, changes will be implemented.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union and five non-EU countries have banned the use of four antibiotics to promote growth in food producing animals effective July 1, 1999, and will extend this ban to the remaining approved growth promoting antibiotics by 2006.  While three of these products were not manufactured or sold by us, bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic growth promoter for livestock and poultry which is manufactured by us, is included in the ban.  The Company's attempt to reverse or limit the EU ban that affects the Company's Albac product, was not successful and not appealed.  Similar actions to ban or severely restrict the use in animals of antibiotics have been taken by EU trading partners or are being contemplated.   (See "Risk Factors".)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Requirements similar to those in the U.S. and EU apply to the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations for pharmaceutical products in Asia and Africa.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Facility Compliance</I>.<I>  </I>The Company's manufacturing operations in the U.S. and three of the Company's European facilities that manufacture products for export to the U.S. are required to comply with FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations ("cGMP").  cGMP encompasses all aspects of the production process, including validation and record keeping, in addition to standards for facilities, equipment and personnel, and involves changing and evolving standards.  Consequently, continuing compliance with cGMP can be a particularly difficult and expensive part of regulatory compliance.  There are similar cGMP regulations in other countries where the Company has manufacturing operations.  The EU requires that before a medicinal product can be manufactured and assembled, each company that carries out such an operation must hold a manufacturer's license, a product license must be held by the person responsible for the composition of the product, and the manufacture and assemb
ly must be in accordance with the product license and good manufacturing practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA.  During 2001 and 2002, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA for its USHP facility in Baltimore. With respect to its USHP facility in Elizabeth, the Company received a warning letter from the FDA during 2001 and a 483 Report from the FDA during 2003. The Company believes that the issues raised in the warning letter were adequately addressed as no further comments were received from the FDA in a follow-up inspection. The 483 Report listed alleged deviations from cGMP requirements.  The Company estimates that the cost of addressing the deviations listed in those 483 Reports will be approximately $38 million.  (See "Risk Factors" and "Legal Proceedings".)  The Company has received 483 Reports from time to time in the past for other plants, all of which the Company believes it has adequately addressed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further with regard to cGMPs, in August 2002, the FDA announced a major new initiative on the regulation of drug product quality entitled "Pharmaceuticals cGMPs for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century."  The two-year program is intended to ensure, among other things, that regulatory review and inspection policies are based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science and to encourage the adoption of new technological advances by the pharmaceutical industry.  Additionally, risk-based approaches, that focus both industry and FDA attention on critical areas, will be implemented.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Potential Liability for Current Products.  </I>Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others.  These studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Extended Protection for Certain  Products.  </I>The Waxman-Hatch Act amended in 1984 both the Patent Code and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, better known as the FDC Act.  The Waxman-Hatch Act codified and expanded application procedures for obtaining FDA approval for generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals that are off-patent or whose market exclusivity has expired.  The Waxman-Hatch Act also provides patent extension and market exclusivity provisions for innovator drug manufacturers which preclude the submission or delay the approval of a competing ANDA under certain conditions.  One such provision allows a five year market exclusivity period for NDAs involving new chemical entities and a three year market exclusivity period for NDAs or NDA supplements containing new clinical investigations essential to the approval of such application.  The market exclusivity provisions apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products.  Another provision authorizes the extens
ion of patent terms for up to five years as compensation for some of the reductions of the effective life of the patent as a result of time spent in testing for, and FDA review of, an application for a drug approval.  Patent terms may also be extended pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, or URAA.  In addition, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 ("FDAMA") allows brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers under certain circumstances to seek six months of additional exclusivity when they have conducted pediatric studies on the drug in accordance with the statute's requirements.  Although the pediatric exclusivity provisions in FDAMA contained a sunset date of January 1, 2002, they were re-authorized by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was signed into law in January 2002.  In addition, the first generic applicant who files an ANDA challenging a patent listed by the brand name manufacturer (i.e. an ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification stating that the generic drug will no
t infringe any listed patent(s) for the reference drug or that such patent(s) is (are) invalid or unenforceable) may receive an exclusivity period of 180 days under certain circumstances during which times other generic applications for the product containing paragraph IV certifications cannot be approved.  Therefore, the Company cannot predict the extent to which the Waxman-Hatch Act, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, the FDAMA , or URAA could postpone approval of some of the Company's new products. Moreover, changes in the statutes or regulations may occur over time. The Company cannot predict the extent to which any such future changes may affect its products or product development.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Europe, certain Directives confer a similar market exclusivity in respect of proprietary medicines, irrespective of any patent protection.  Before a generic manufacturer can present an abridged application for a marketing authorization (as detailed above), it must generally wait until the original proprietary drug has been on the market for a certain period, unless they have the consent of the person who submitted the original test data for the first marketing authorization, or can compile an adequate dossier of their own.  In the case of high technology products, the period is ten years or in some states for other medicinal products six years, subject to the option for member states to elect for an exclusivity period of ten years with respect to all products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the exclusivity period, it is also possible in the EU to extend the period of patent protection for a product which has a marketing authorization by means of a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.  An SPC comes into force on the expiry of the relevant patent and lasts for a period calculated with reference to the delay between the filing of the patent and the granting of the first marketing authorization for the drug.  This period of protection, subject to a maximum of five years, further delays the marketing of generic medicinal products.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Generic Drug Enforcement Act.  </I>The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992, which amended the FDC Act, gives the FDA six ways to penalize companies that engage in wrongdoing in connection with the development or approval of an ANDA.  The FDA can:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>permanently or temporarily prohibit wrongdoers from submitting or assisting in the submission of an ANDA;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>temporarily deny approval of, or suspend applications to market, particular generic drugs;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed pursuant to ANDAs of such person;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>withdraw approval of an ANDA;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>seek civil penalties against the alleged wrongdoer; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>under appropriate procedures, significantly delay the approval of any pending ANDA from such person.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has never been the subject of an enforcement action under this statute, but there can be no assurance that restrictions or fines will not be imposed on the Company in the future.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Controlled Substances Act.  </I>The Company also manufactures and sells drug products which are "controlled substances" as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, which establishes certain security personnel, reporting, record keeping and import and export requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, a division of the Department of Justice.  The Company is registered by the DEA to manufacture and distribute certain controlled substances.  The DEA has a dual mission: law enforcement and regulation.  The former deals with the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them.  The DEA shares enforcement authority with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another division of the Department of Justice.  The DEA's regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed handlers of controlled substances, and with the substances themselves, equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in 
order to prevent such articles from being diverted into illicit channels of commerce.  The Company is not under any restrictions for noncompliance with the foregoing regulations, but there can be no assurance that restrictions or fines will not be imposed on the Company in the future.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health Care Reimbursement.  </I>The methods and level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products under Medicare, Medicaid, and other domestic reimbursement programs are the subject of constant review by state and federal governments and private third party payors like insurance companies.  The Company believes that U.S. government agencies will continue to review and assess alternative payment methodologies and reform measures designed to reduce the cost of drugs to the public.  As a part of this effort the federal government and several states have commenced administrative or court actions challenging the pricing practices of certain named drug manufacturers.  The Company is not a party to any of these actions.  Because the outcome of these and other health care reform initiatives is uncertain, the Company cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have on it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's selling price based on sales of outpatient drug products reimbursed under state Medicaid programs.  The required rebate rate for manufacturers of generic products is currently 11% of the weighted average selling price for each product at the unit level.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many countries in which the Company does business, other than the U.S., the initial prices of pharmaceutical preparations for human use are dependent upon governmental approval or clearance under governmental reimbursement schemes.  These government programs generally establish prices by reference to either manufacturing costs or the prices of comparable products.  Subsequent price increases may also be regulated.  In past years, as part of overall programs to reduce health care costs, certain European governments have prohibited price increases and have introduced various systems designed to lower prices.  A review of proposed legislative changes to the U.K. generic pharmaceutical market is currently ongoing and as part of the review an interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the U.K. has been introduced.  In Germany, new legislation was introduced in January 2002 which re-adjusted the existing fixed price system, requiring  price reductions for c
ertain human generic pharmaceutical products including a large number of the Company's products. Additionally, while the new German law does permit pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs, there are several exceptions to this law that, in the Company's view, will make it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  Legislation has been proposed for introduction in 2003 in Germany and France that, if adopted in the form presently proposed, would have the effect of eliminating government reimbursement for significant Company products, which would materially lower sales of these products.  If adopted as proposed, revenues and income would be adversely effected in these countries.  Similar legislation is being considered in Sweden.  Additionally, in France, proposed legislation is under review which, if adopted, would introduce a system of reference pricing that may put downward pressure on pricing of the Company's products and would have the effect of removin
g a significant number of the Company's products from eligibility for government reimbursement.  (See the sections "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states in the EU regulate the pricing of such products and, in some cases, limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services.  These controls can result in considerable price differences between member states.  There is also a Common External Tariff payable on import of medicinal products into the EU, though exemptions are available in respect of certain products allowing duty free importation.  Where there is no tariff suspension in operation in respect of a medicinal product, an application can be made to import the product duty free, but this is subject to review at the European level to establish whether a member state would be able to produce the product in question instead.  In addition, some products are subject to a governmental quota that restricts the amount that can be imported duty free.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Environmental Compliance</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  The Company is presently engaged in administrative proceedings with respect to soil and aquifer contamination at its Budapest plant.  The Company is subject to state administration orders relating to air and waste discharge issues at its Lowell, Arkansas plant, and waste handling, transportation and discharge issues at its Longmont, Colorado plant.  The ongoing cost of these administrative orders and the Budapest proceeding are not expected to be material.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September 2001, a fire at the Company's Lowell, Arkansas plant resulted in the release of arsenic into water entering the local water treatment facility, soil surrounding the plant and in soot spread within the plant.  Remediation activities, performed under the supervision of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, were completed in 2002.  Remediation was completed with substantially all costs covered by insurance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although many major capital projects typically include a component for environmental control, including the Company's current expansion projects, no material expenditures specifically for environmental control are expected to be made in 2003.  However, the Company is currently implementing an integrated environmental health and safety management system across most of its operations, and we may incur significant expenses, including potential fines or penalties, if we discover environmental conditions or past non-compliance at our facilities.  In addition, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements at sites at which we are currently undertaking environmental remediation could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raw Materials  </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many raw materials, including APIs, required for the Company's business are purchased from single suppliers.  Any interruption in the availability of these materials could cause production delays and decrease sales of the affected products. Such interruption in the business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.  In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials which may require additional regulatory approvals as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revisions of Financial Statements</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the third quarter of 2000, the Company revised its financial statements for the four quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2000.  The revisions resulted from invoices in Brazil that were either not supported by underlying transactions or for which the recorded sales were inconsistent with underlying transactions.  In November 2001, the Company announced the completion of a revision of its financial statements for 1998, 1999, 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001.  This revision resulted predominantly from a required modification in recognizing revenue for specific customer orders in the Company's AH business in 1998, 1999 and 2000 from the time the order was segregated in a third party warehouses and billed, to a subsequent period when the order was shipped from the third party warehouse to the customer.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employees</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately<B> </B>4,700 employees, comprising of approximately 2,050 in the U.S. and 2,650 outside of the U.S.  The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be good.  Three U.S. plants are subject to collective bargaining agreements and four of the Company's major European facilities have works councils and are subject to national labor agreements.  The Company believes its relations with all of these employee units is satisfactory.  Two collective bargaining agreements relating to AH employees at the Willow Island facility will expire in the first half of 2003.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Risk Factors</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report includes certain forward-looking statements. Like any company subject to a competitive and changing business environment, the Company cannot guarantee the results predicted in any of the Company's forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include (but are not limited to) the following:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has submitted comprehensive corrective action plans to the FDA in response to observations received at its Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.  Failure to adequately address these observations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2001 and 2002, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facility in Baltimore.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from, primarily, cGMPs.  The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation from the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree that required general compliance with cGMPs.  During 2003, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA as a result of an FDA inspection at its USHP facility in Elizabeth. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2002 inspection at Baltimore and the 2003 inspection at Elizabeth resulted in 483 Reports in response to which the Company submitted comprehensive corrective action plans to the FDA.  The Company has commenced implementation of these plans at both facilities.   The corrective action plans included product recalls of certain products produced in Baltimore, which were conducted in 2002, and product recalls of certain products produced in Elizabeth, which were conducted in 2003.  The costs of these recalls have already been incurred.  The Baltimore corrective action plan also includes a production slow-down, which commenced in 2002 and continues into 2003.  The Company incurred costs of $3.2 million during 2002 and expects to incur an additional approximately $35 million of costs in the future in connection with the implementation of these corrective action plans.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FDA has not responded to the Company as to the adequacy of either of these plans or the recalls and slow-down action contained therein.  There can be no assurance that the ongoing implementation of the corrective action plans or the FDA's reaction to the status of these facilities, will not require further actions at substantial additional costs, including additional product recalls or corrective actions that further restrict production from their current levels.  In addition, future recalls could result in significant costs to the Company, potential disruptions in the supply of the Company's products to its customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm the Company's ability to market its products.  Similarly, a recall of one of the Company's products or a product manufactured by another manufacturer could impair sales of other similar products the Company markets as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FDA compliance status of each of the Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities has had and will continue to have the effect of delaying new product approvals at each of these facilities, until the FDA is satisfied that sufficient progress has been made to achieve compliance with cGMPs with respect to these facilities. Product approval delays at any one of the Company's facilities will not necessarily have an effect on product approvals at its other facilities.  If the time necessary to achieve compliance is extended beyond what has been estimated in the Company's corrective action plans, the delay could be materially adverse.  The FDA also has the authority to impose civil fines and to utilize equitable disgorgement in connection with the 483 Reports or the Baltimore consent decree, although the FDA has not taken any such action with respect to the Company. (See the immediately following risk factor, which deals with government regulations.)  These matters could have a material adverse affect
 on the Company's future operations.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is subject to government regulations and actions that increase the Company's costs and could prevent it from marketing and selling some of its products in certain countries.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health products are subject to extensive government regulation.  Government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, record keeping, pricing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products.  Government regulation substantially increases the cost of manufacturing, developing and selling the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations. These reviews can result in regulatory concerns requiring a response by the Company.  Failure to adequately address these concerns could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including product approval delays, reduced production and production interruptions, among other things.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production or distribution and debarment of individuals or the Company from providing services to drug companies in any capacity or obtaining new drug approvals.  In recent years, besides stepped up enforcement of cGMP requirements, the federal government has utilized equitable disgorgement as a means of enforcing compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations.  There can be no assurance that the FDA would not seek to impose similar sanctions on the Company and any such sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company
's business and operations.  (See the immediately preceding risk factor, which deals with corrective action plans involving cGMPs at the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company also has affiliations, license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory approvals sought by such third parties.  The Company's vendors and third party contract manufacturers are subject to regulatory compliance.  If any one of these third parties is found to have violations of a regulatory significance, the Company would be materially negatively impacted as its supply of API and/or product would be threatened.  While the Company takes measures where appropriate and available to secure back-up suppliers, there can be no assurance that such contingency plans will be able to provide adequate and timely product to eliminate any threat of interruption of supply of the Company's products to its customers or that these problems will not otherwise materially impact the Company's business.  (See immediately preceding risk factor, which deals with corrective action plans at Baltimore and Elizabeth.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has filed, and continues to file, applications to market its products with the FDA and other regulatory agencies both in the U.S. and internationally.  The timing of receipt of approvals of these applications can significantly affect the Company's future revenues and income.  This is particularly significant with respect to human pharmaceuticals where the Company is, in certain instances, using procedures, known as "paragraph IV certification," to seek marketing approvals prior to the latest date as to which a third party may claim patent protection, including, among others, with respect to gabapentin.  The use of this strategy may involve lengthy litigation, frequently with substantially larger and better financed pharmaceutical companies.  There can be no assurance that the Company will obtain new product approvals in a timely manner, if ever, through litigation or otherwise.  Failure to obtain approvals when expected, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Co
mpany's business.  (See the immediately preceding risk factor, which deals with corrective action plans for the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth facilities.)  The Company also has affiliations, license agreements and other arrangements with companies that depend on regulatory approvals sought by those companies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals.  While most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that the Company offers for sale, the European Union and five non-EU countries banned the use of bacitracin zinc, a feed antibiotic and growth promoter manufactured by the Company and others that has been used in livestock feeds for over 40 years, effective July 1, 1999.  The Company has not sold this product in these countries since the ban took effect.  The EU ban is based upon the "Precautionary Principle", which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by scientific certainty.  T
he Company's effort to reverse this action in the Court of First Instance of the European Court was unsuccessful and the Company has decided not to appeal this ruling.  Although the EU action negatively impacted the Company's business, it was not material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban will be expanded.  If either (a)&nbsp;the EU or countries or customers within the EU, act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based products, or (b)&nbsp;there is an expansion of the ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products or (c) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the Company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  The Company also cannot predict whether this antibiotic resistance concern will result in expanded regulations adversely affecting other antibiotic-based animal health products manufactured by the Company of which it has significant sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The discussions concerning resistance to antibiotics used in certain food producing animals have recently become more active in the U.S.  Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse effects of the use of antibiotics in food animals.  Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company's customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics.  It is uncertain what actions, if any, the FDA may take in connection with drug resistant bacteria in animal health products.  However, the FDA has proposed a rating system to be used to compare the risks associated with the animal use of specific antibiotic products, including those sold by the Company.  While the Company does not believe that the presently proposed risk assessment system would be materially adverse to its business, it is subject to change prior to adoption or later amendment.  The loss of the U.S. market for, or negative publicity regarding, the
 Company's antibiotic-based products would be materially adverse to the Company.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's foreign operations are subject to additional economic and political risks.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's foreign operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions, political instability in some countries, and uncertainty as to the enforceability of, and government control over, commercial rights.  The uncertainty related to the conflict with Iraq and continued terrorist threats could adversely affect the operations of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company sells products in many countries that are susceptible to significant foreign currency fluctuations.  The Company's API products are generally sold for U.S. dollars, which eliminates the direct exposure to currency fluctuations, but increases credit risk if the local currency devalues significantly and it becomes more difficult for customers to purchase U.S. dollars required to pay the Company.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain regions, including Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia, are being affected by wide currency fluctuations and decreased economic activity in these regions and, in some limited areas, by social and political unrest.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interruption in the supply of the Company's raw materials or products or an adverse event at one of the Company's manufacturing facilities could adversely effect its operations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company currently purchases many of its raw materials, including APIs, and other products from single suppliers and many of its products are manufactured at a single facility.  Any interruption in the supply of these materials or an adverse event at the facilities that manufacture and blend the Company's products, could decrease sales of the affected products.  In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials or products or to lease or purchase new manufacturing facilities.  The Company may be unable to find a third party willing or able to provide the necessary products or facilities suitable for manufacturing pharmaceuticals on terms acceptable to the Company.  If the Company had to obtain substitute materials or products, the Company would require additional regulatory approvals, as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer.  The use of new facilities similarly would require regulatory
 approvals.  Any significant interruption of supply from the Company's suppliers or adverse event at any of its manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has been and will continue to be affected by competitive factors, including price competition and restrictions, including government regulations, in certain markets.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's generic pharmaceuticals business has historically been subject to intense competition, particularly on the basis of price.  As patents and other bases for market exclusivity expire, prices typically decline as generic competitors, such as the Company, enter the marketplace.  Normally, there is a further unit price decline as the number of generic competitors increases.  The timing of these price decreases is unpredictable and can result in a significantly curtailed period of profitability for a generic product.  In addition, brand name and patented pharmaceuticals manufacturers frequently take actions to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalents.  These actions may include:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>filing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>developing patented controlled-release products or other product improvements; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>increasing marketing initiatives and filing of additional litigation.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic pharmaceuticals market conditions, particularly, in the U.S., were further affected in recent years by a fundamental shift in industry distribution, purchasing and stocking patterns resulting from increased importance of sales to major wholesalers and a concurrent reduction in sales to private label generic distributors.  Wholesaler programs generally require lower prices on products sold, lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesaler's own marketing programs.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The factors that have adversely affected the U.S. generic pharmaceuticals industry may also affect some or all of the markets in which the Company operates internationally.  In addition, in Europe, the Company is encountering price pressure from parallel imports of identical products from lower priced markets under EU laws of free movement of goods.  Parallel imports could lead to lower revenue and operating income for the Company.  The Company's international pharmaceuticals business is also affected by general governmental initiatives to reduce drug prices, including price controls or other restrictions on the Company's industry.  Parallel imports, governmental cost containment and other regulatory efforts could cause lower prices in certain markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany and the Nordic countries, where the Company has significant sales. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom Department of Health is currently reviewing proposed legislative changes to the United Kingdom generic pharmaceuticals market, and as part of this review introduced in August 2000 interim maximum pricing legislation for the sale of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.  These price controls are expected to remain in place at least during 2003.  The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, a downward trend in prices for the Company's human generic pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom resulting, at present, from competitive pressures with the potential for further price decreases as a result of future regulatory actions.  The Company is unable to predict the long-term impact these circumstances will have on the Company's United Kingdom operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom.  In Germany, new legislation was introduced in January, 2002 which adjusted the existing fixed price system, requ
iring price reductions for a large number of human generic pharmaceutical products in Germany including a number of the Company's products.  While this new German law does permit pharmacist substitution of generics for certain branded drugs, there are several exceptions to this law which, in the Company's view, will make it less than fully effective in requiring such substitution on a broad basis.  Overall, the Company expects this legislation to result in lower prices for human generic pharmaceutical products in Germany and this is expected to result in decreased profitability for all industry participants including the Company.  In addition, regulations proposed for introduction in 2003 would remove certain products from eligibility for government patient reimbursement, including at least one product important to the Company's German operations, Pentalong.  The Company is unable to predict the impact these circumstances will have on the Company's German operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharm
aceuticals in Germany.  Similar substitution legislation is being considered in Sweden.  In France, legislation has been proposed which would terminate government reimbursement to a large group of generic products, including a significant number of the products sold by the Company.  This loss of government reimbursement would be materially adverse to the Company's French operations, but the Company is unable to predict whether this legislation will be adopted or, if adopted, its final form.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all the Company's businesses, it may become more difficult for the Company to respond to competitive challenges because it has few major customers, such as large wholesalers, animal producers and chain stores, a rapidly changing market and uncertainty of timing of new product approvals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Europe, the international generic human pharmaceutical and animal pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and many of the Company's competitors in these areas are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company possesses.  The increased focus on pharmaceutical prices in Europe may lead to increased competition and price pressures for suppliers of all types of pharmaceuticals, including generics.  In addition, in certain countries such as France, because of the Company's size and product mix, the Company may not be able to capitalize on such changes in competition and pricing as fully as the Company's competitors.  Additionally, the Company expects new entrants in the generic medicated animal feed additive market in 2003.  The Company's branded drug business also may face competitive challenges from generic equivalents.  The Company has two patents for Kadian that are subject to paragraph IV challenges, though there have been n
o such challenges to date.  Upon entry of a generic equivalent in the market, the Company's branded products could lose substantial sales.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's Human Pharmaceutical business is affected by the reimbursement policies of third party payors, such as insurers and managed care organizations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's commercial success with respect to generic products depends, in part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement for the Company's customers from third party health care payors, such as government and private health insurers and managed care organizations.  Third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services and their reimbursement practices may prevent the Company from maintaining the Company's present product price levels.  In addition, the market for the Company's products may be limited by third party payors who establish lists of approved products and do not provide reimbursement for products not listed.  Medicaid legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to rebate state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's selling price on sales of certain prescription drugs reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs.  Certain states, such as Michigan and Florida, have adopted measures to contain further the
 costs incurred for prescription drugs under their Medicaid programs.  These measures include placing certain prescription drugs on a restricted list and negotiating additional discounts in the prices paid for prescription drugs.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's liability from accidents, product liability or other claims may exceed the Company's insurance coverage.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company seeks to obtain liability and direct damage insurance to protect it from the liability due to accidents, product liability and other claims that arise in the course of doing business.  Insurance that the Company seeks to obtain to protect itself against these potential liabilities may be inadequate, unobtainable or prohibitively expensive.  The Company is subject to renewal of most of its insurance policies each year and changes are anticipated at each renewal.  In recent months, the Company has experienced significant increases in its insurance costs and coverage reductions including coverage exclusions pertaining to certain products that it now manufactures or may manufacture in the future.  The Company's inability to obtain and maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company does not know the ultimate impact of the infringement claims brought by Pfizer relating to gabapentin and does not know with any certainty if it will have to write-off inventory relating to gabapentin.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has filed a paragraph IV certification challenging the patents protecting Pfizer's Neurontin (gabapentin) tablets and capsules, a drug used to treat epilepsy.  While not assured, this filing could provide the Company with generic market exclusivity for a period of up to six months.  Given the size of the gabapentin market (over $2.0 billion in 2002) and the market price and share normally anticipated during a period of generic exclusivity, the Company's profit potential (which it is initially obligated to share equally with its supplier of the drug's active ingredient for a limited period) could be significant if the Company obtains market exclusivity.  Torpharm, a competitor  has filed an ANDA for gabapentin capsules, recently filed a lawsuit against the FDA seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA.  If Torpharm is successful, the Company could lose its rights to exclusivity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Pfizer has filed several lawsuits challenging the Company's position that it can introduce the product prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the Pfizer patents.  The Waxman-Hatch Act 30 month automatic bar against the Company's launch has expired and, subject to a favorable outcome with respect to the exclusivity issues, the Company may be legally entitled  to commence the sale of the product prior to a final decision in the Pfizer litigation.  It is possible, however, that additional patents on gabapentin may be issued to Pfizer, possibly triggering additional delay on the start of the exclusivity period for up to 30 months.  The Company could also wait to commence sales until the receipt of a court decision or any appeal.   A launch at any time before a final decision on Pfizer's claims would leave the Company exposed to potential material infringement damages if Pfizer were to ultimately prevail in the litigation.  In addition, in order to be prepared to take advanta
ge of any applicable six month period of exclusivity, the Company would be required to produce significant amounts of inventory prior to any planned product launch and, perhaps, prior to knowing whether the Company has been finally awarded exclusivity or the receipt of a final court ruling in the Pfizer litigation.   In the event that Pfizer prevails in the litigation, the Company is not awarded exclusivity or the outcome of either of these events results in a significant launch delay, this inventory may no longer be commercially saleable which would result in a write-off and a charge against the Company's income in the relevant period.  (See "Legal Proceedings".)</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company intends to pursue product-specific licensing, marketing agreements, co-development opportunities and other partnering arrangements in its Human Pharmaceuticals and Animal Health businesses.  The Company may also pursue selective acquisitions.  The Company cannot be sure that it will be able to locate suitable partners for these transactions.  In addition, assuming the Company identifies suitable partners, the process of effectively entering into these arrangements involves risks that the Company's management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns and that the Company may have difficulty integrating the new arrangements into its existing business.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company remains highly leveraged.  The Company's substantial indebtedness could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage or could adversely affect it's ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2002, the Company's total debt was $895.9 million and its total consolidated shareholders' equity was $1,005.2 million.  The Company's operating income and EBITDA (as defined the 2001 Credit Facility) relative to its level of indebtedness could restrict its operations.  Among other things, the Company's indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness: </P>

<UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>require a substantial portion of the Company's cash flow from operations for the payment of interest on the Company's debt;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>limit the Company's ability to use its cash flow, or to obtain additional financing, to fund acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>limit the Company's flexibility to plan for and react to changes and take advantage of opportunities in its business and industry;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>increase the Company's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>place the Company at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.</LI></P></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Company may incur additional debt.  The Company agreements  permit the Company and its subsidiary guarantors to incur substantial additional debt.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Servicing the Company's debt requires a significant amount of cash, and the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt depends on the Company's ability to generate cash flow.  This, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company's control.  In addition, the Company's ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on its satisfaction of the financial covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility and other debt agreements.  The Company's business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to the Company under the 2001 Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash, it may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity.  The Company may not be able to refinance any of its debt on favorable terms, or at all.  A
ny inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance the Company's debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Covenant restrictions under the Company's outstanding debt instruments may limit the Company's ability to operate its business.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's outstanding debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and the guarantors to finance future operations and capital needs and engage in certain other business activities.  For example, the 2001 Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to financial covenants, the 2001 Credit Facility has a number of non-financial provisions including a requirement that Industrier maintain control over sufficient shares the of the Company's Class B common stock to permit Industrier to elect a majority of the Company's Board of Directors.  The maintenance of this control over the Company is subject to the unilateral actions of Industrier and the maintenance by Industrier of certain collateral value under Industrier's bank loan agreement which terminates on June 30, 2003 (which includes a computation based, in part, on the assumed value of the shares of Class B common stock of the Company owned by Industrier which, in turn, is based upon the market value of the Company's Class A common stock as established from time to time on the New York Stock Exchange).  If Industrier's collateral value falls below a certain level (which, assuming a constant value of Industrier's other collateralized assets, would occur if the Company's Class
 A common stock price is $3.50 or lower) lenders could declare a default under Industrier's bank loan agreement.  In the event of default or if Industrier does not fully pay or refinance its bank loan agreement at its June 30, 2003 maturity date, Industrier's banks may act to enforce their rights by causing a change in the beneficial ownership of the Company's Class B common stock held by Industrier.  Any such change in beneficial ownership of the Company's Class B common stock held by Industrier would constitute a change in control of the Company and a default under the 2001 Credit Facility.  The 2001 Credit Facility also contains a requirement that the Company deliver unqualified audit reports from its independent accountants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2001 Credit Facility  also requires that the Company reduce the outstanding principal amount of (i) its 5.75% Notes to $10.0 million or less by October 1, 2004 and (ii) its 3% Notes to $10.0 million or less by December 1, 2005.  In order to satisfy these obligations, the Company may need to issue additional shares of Class A common stock to the holders of the Notes, which would dilute the interests of the Company's current stockholders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Events beyond the Company's control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect its ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the 2001 Credit Facility.  The Company might not meet these covenants, and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet these covenants.  A breach of any of these covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in a default under the 2001 Credit Facility and under the other debt agreements.  If an event of default under the 2001 Credit Facility occurs, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.  The 2001 Credit Facility is also subject to termination in certain cases.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interests of the Company's controlling stockholder may conflict with interests of the Company.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Industrier is the beneficial owner of 11,872,897 shares of the Company's Class B common stock as of December 31, 2002, which represented 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock as of that date.  As of December 31, 2002, Industrier had 54.6% of the voting power of our common stock.  Therefore,  Industrier has significant influence and control over the Company's business and is presently entitled to elect two-thirds of the members of its board of directors.  Einar Sissener, Chairman of the board of directors of the Company, controls a majority of Industrier's outstanding shares and is Chairman of Industrier.  In addition, Mr. Sissener beneficially owns 373,667 shares of the Company's Class A common stock.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Industrier has the ability to make decisions affecting the Company's business and capital structure, including, in some instances, the issuance of additional indebtedness.  Industrier may pursue future transactions that could enhance its equity investment while involving risks to the interests of the Company.  All contractual arrangements between the Company and Industrier are subject to review by, or the ratification of, the audit committee of the Company's board of directors as to the fairness of the terms and conditions of such arrangements to the Company.  The audit committee consists solely of one or more directors who are unaffiliated with Industrier.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company also engages in various transactions with Industrier from time to time, and conflicts of interest are present with respect to the terms of such transactions.  </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Item 3. Legal Proceedings</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Class Action Lawsuit</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  This class action has been brought on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company's securities between April 28, 1999 and October 30, 2000.  The Company is named as a defendant along with two of its board members, one of whom is an officer, and two of its former officers.  The class action complaint alleges that, among other things, the plaintiffs were damaged when they acquired the Company's securities because, as a result of (1) alleged irregularities in the Company's Animal Health business in Brazil, (2) allegedly improper revenue recognition practices and (3) the October 2000 revision of its financial results for 1999 and 2000, the Company's previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company's securities.  The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities an
d Exchange Act of 1934.  The plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on legal grounds and the District Court granted its motion with prejudice as to all defendants.  The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court and the District Court affirmed its earlier dismissal.  The plaintiffs have appealed the Court's decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  The Company intends to vigorously defend this appeal.  Additionally, the Company has filed a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the named individual defendants under its directors' and officers' insurance policies and believes that insurance coverage exists to the extent of the policy limits for the costs incurred in defending the claims and any adverse judgment or settlement, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the relevant insurance policy.  Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class actio
n will result in liability which will be material to the Company's financial position.  However, it is not possible for the Company to conclude definitively that resolution of the lawsuit will not be material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or year in which it occurs.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SEC Investigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements.  While deposition discovery is underway, the proceeding is in its early stages.  The SEC has stated that the commencement of this investigation is not an indication that the SEC presently believes that a violation of any applicable laws has occurred.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FDA Facility Inspections</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 2001 and 2003, the Company received substantial notices of inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Baltimore and Elizabeth, respectively.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from, primarily, cGMPs.  The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with cGMPs.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive corrective action plan to the FDA in October 2002.  The FDA has not formally commented on the Company's corrective action plan.  The Company expects the FDA to respond to its proposed plan in 2003.  The Company has begun upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore plant in accordance with the plan and has provided written monthly updates t
o the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by mid-2004.  The estimated total cost of the Baltimore corrective actions is approximately $30.0 million.  As part of the corrective action plan, product recalls were conducted in 2002 and production at the Baltimore facility was reduced.  This reduction in production has had an effect on earnings in 2002 and the possibility of an adverse effect in 2003 was incorporated into the Company budgeting process.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between November, 2002 and January, 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of this inspection, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA on January 15, 2003.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response on February 5, 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The Company anticipates completion of these actions during or before February 2004.  Certain product recalls were included in the corrective action plan which were recorded in 2002.  The corrective action plan contemplates continued output at 2002 levels.  The estimated total cost of the Elizabeth corrective actions is approximately $8.0 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total cost and timing of both the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective action plans may change based upon the FDA responses which have not yet been received and other factors.  (See "Risk Factors".)</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Union Product Action</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union Court of First Instance has upheld the European Union's (the "EU") ban on bacitracin zinc, one of the Company's feed additive products which was banned from sale in the EU effective July 1, 1999.  The Company has not sold bacitracin zinc in the EU since 1999, therefore the court action will have no material financial impact on the Company. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gabapentin</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDAs filed under paragraph IV for gabapentin capsules and tablets, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998 with respect to capsules and on December 12, 1999 with respect to tablets, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and the FDA that its proposed generic gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.  In the litigation concerning the Company's gabapentin capsules, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the two patents, which was subsequently denied.  The Company filed in the tablet litig
ation, and renewed in the capsule litigation, the Company's motion of summary judgment of non-infringement on Pfizer's patents.  These motions are under consideration by the District Court.  Discovery is complete and the case is awaiting trial. &nbsp;During the lawsuits regarding gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels.  After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under paragraph IV that the Company's proposed gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable.  In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this patent.  The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent.  This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  Discovery
 has closed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All three gabapentin cases have been consolidated for trial.  While no trial date has been set, a pre-trial conference is expected by the end of March 2003 at which time a date for trial is expected to be set.  Unless and until the Company receives FDA authorization and decides to utilize such authorization to market its gabapentin tablets or capsules, the Company would, in the event of an adverse decision, at most, only be liable to Pfizer for its legal costs and not any monetary damages.  To date, the Company has not marketed these pharmaceuticals.  There is the possibility that as a result of this litigation, the Company could be prevented from marketing the Company's gabapentin capsules or tablets until Pfizer's patents expire. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the Company be permitted to market gabapentin prior to the expiration of the Pfizer patents, it expects to apply to the FDA for access to the 180 day period of generic marketing exclusivity, which is generally awarded to the generic competitor who is first in time to file a paragraph IV certification against the relevant patents of the innovator.  In August 2002, the Company sued the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to clarify its rights to exclusivity and for a ruling that it properly submitted a statement of inapplicable use to one of the Orange Book listed patents.  In December 2002, the court ruled that the Company's  statement of inapplicable use was appropriate.  The court deferred to the FDA to decide the impact of the court's ruling on the subject of exclusivity.  On January 28, 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that it has secured eligibility for 180 day market exclusivity on gabapentin 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules.  Exclu
sivity for this product will be triggered by the earlier of either Purepac's commercial marketing of gabapentin or a court decision that finds the relevant Pfizer patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  While the FDA ruling does not address the tablet form of gabapentin, the Company expects the FDA position on market exclusivity for the 600 mg and 800 mg gabapentin tablets to be consistent with its position on capsules.  The FDA's ruling is a significant positive event for the Company.  A court action would be required to overrule the FDA's decision and for the Company to lose its eligibility for 180 day market exclusivity.  On February 14, 2003, Torpharm, a competitor that has filed  an ANDA for gabapentin capsules, filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA.  If Torpharm is successful, the Company could lose its rights to the 180 day exclusivity period.  The Company has intervened in the lawsuit se
eking to maintain its right to exclusivity.  No trial date has been set and the Company cannot predict when the court will issue a decision.  The Company can give no assurance that it will ultimately benefit from an exclusivity period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In anticipation of the launch of gabapentin, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (the "API") of gabapentin under which the Company has acquired API inventory.  The terms of the Company's agreement with the API supplier will require the payment to the supplier of a portion of the Company's net sales of finished dose gabapentin product during any period of exclusivity ("Net Sales Split").  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had paid approximately $4.4 million in partial payment of inventory on hand.  The Company will make an additional payment of approximately $4.4 million for on hand inventory in 2003 and a third payment of approximately $8.2 million in 2004.  A further payment of approximately $8.2 million will be due only upon final FDA approval of the Company's marketing authorization for gabapentin.  All of these payments reduce the Net Sales Split on a dollar for dollar basis.  The Company cannot predict the outcom
e of the gabapentin litigation; however, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, or other factors preventing the Company from selling the finished product, the Company will reassess the net realizable value of the API inventory, and may incur a charge to write-down API inventory on hand to its net realizable value and record any required payments under the supply agreement.  The maximum charge could be approximately $25.2 million based on inventory currently on hand.  The Company has no present obligation to purchase additional API inventory. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supplier and Customer Matters</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers,  customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business.  It is the view of management, after consultation with counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all other pending suits should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.</P>

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late 2001 and 2002, Alpharma focused on de-leveraging its balance sheet by converting $212 million of the Company's convertible notes into common stock and reducing additional indebtedness with free cash flow generated through operational efficiencies in the use of working capital and by reducing capital expenditures. 2001 and 2000 were years which included a number of significant transactions which the Company entered into as part of, or to finance, its previous acquisition program. No acquisitions were planned or completed during 2002.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in 2001 and continuing in 2002, the Company incurred significant charges for reorganization, refocus and de-leveraging which were intended to improve future operations and reduce debt and recognize asset impairments.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company incurred pre-tax charges and write-downs of $225.0 million plus extraordinary items after tax of $1.1 million, including significant charges and expenses related to the required acquisition accounting for OPB (pre-tax $5.4 million), de-leveraging activities (pre-tax $51.1 million, plus extraordinary items after-tax of $1.1 million), severance charges and asset write-downs related to reorganization and refocus of the organization (pre-tax $53.4 million) and the impairment of assets and goodwill, (pre-tax $115.1 million) primarily in the Animal Health segment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter, the Company amended the senior loan agreement to include covenant relief for certain fourth quarter charges for plant closings and impairments primarily in the Animal Health business. The fourth quarter charges were approximately $119.6 million pre-tax ($1.51 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the amendment reduced the revolving credit commitment by $150.0 million. The Company repaid term debt of $50.0 million in the fourth quarter which resulted in an extraordinary charge of $1.0 million pre-tax and $.7 million after tax. The reduction and repayment resulted in a write-off of deferred debt expense of $3.2 million ($.04 per share).  The early extinguishment of term debt resulted in an extraordinary charge of $1.0 million pre-tax and $.7 million after tax.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in-process research and development.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OPB acquisition was ultimately funded by a $900.0 million Bank Credit Agreement ("2001 Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks and a $200.0 million senior subordinated note. Proceeds from the 2001 Credit Agreement were used to repay the prior Bank Credit Agreement. Bridge financing and other bank fees and the repayment of the prior Bank Credit Agreement resulted in additional expenses of approximately $3.3 million in 2001.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent with the OPB Acquisition, the Company's USPD was combined with the U.S. operations of OPB to form the U.S. Human Pharmaceutical Segment. The combination resulted in approximately $4.8 million in severance charges in 2001.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, the Company's Animal Health Segment announced changes in business practices and a change in existing management.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most comparisons of 2002 consolidated results are affected by the Company's acquisition in December of 2001 of the Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals business ("OPB acquisition") and the financing required to complete the acquisition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparisons of 2002 consolidated results are also affected by the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS 142") effective January 1, 2002 which states that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization, but will be subject to periodic testing for impairment. The full year of 2001 includes approximately $18.3 million of goodwill amortization expense which was not included in 2002 (approximately $.36 per share diluted for the year).</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue increased $263 million (27.0%) to $1,238.0 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the OPB acquisition, which increased revenue by $261.2 million (26.8%). The Company reported an operating loss of ($31.0) million compared to operating income of $24.4 million in 2001 due primarily to asset impairment and other charges of $162.1 million, offset by net increases in operating income from operations and various other factors described in operating income (loss) below. The Company recorded a net loss of $98.8 million ($1.98 per share) in 2002 compared to a net loss of $37.9 million ($.93 per share) in 2001.  Net losses in 2002 and 2001 also include significant charges for exchanges of common stock for debt and other debt reductions.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IG increased 11.9%, excluding both $17.4 million increase due to translation of currencies into the U.S. dollar and $15.3 million due to the inclusion of OPB China. The organic growth in IG revenues resulted from volume increases, (approximately 23% in total), in the UK and other markets for base and new products (including Omeprazole in the UK) offset partially by price declines, (approximately 11% in total), primarily in the UK. Pricing in the UK is below 2001 levels and remains highly competitive. In 2002, legislation was adopted in Germany which also had the effect of lowering pricing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in API increased 12.4% compared to 2001 primarily due to volume increases in Vancomycin and Amphotericin.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in USHP increased due to the inclusion of the OPB - U.S. ($245.9 million), which was acquired in December 2001. Revenues in the liquid and topical business declined due to the recall of two products in the first quarter and the effects of regulatory compliance activities at the Baltimore plant. Certain wholesale customers have levels of inventory that generally range from 2 - 6 months for all products, with a majority at the lower end of the range. One major wholesaler customer typically holds up to 5 months inventory for certain products. These inventory levels have remained consistent , however, in the event that customers reduce inventory levels in the future, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted. Revenues will also be adversely impacted in future quarters by the FDA regulatory compliance activities at the Baltimore and Elizabeth plant. (See Gross Profit below and Note 17.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH revenues declined modestly overall for the year. However, both year's results were impacted by special circumstances. Revenues for the first six months of 2001 totaled $201.4 million and included approximately $38.0 million in revenue related to the financial statement revision which modified the timing of revenue recognition from the time an order was segregated in a third party warehouse and billed, to when the order was delivered. The second six months of 2001 revenues totaled $133.9 million and reflected a change in business practices which reduced the use of certain sales incentives and extended payment terms. The first six months of 2002 revenues were $149.0 million which reflect the lowering of inventories in the distribution system and market acceptance of payment terms of net 30 days. The second half of 2002 revenues were $172.9 million.  Generally, there is a seasonal increase in this business during the second half of the year.</P>

<B>Gross Profit</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a company-wide basis, gross profit increased $148.9 million, and as a percentage of sales, overall gross profit was 42.8% in 2002, compared to 39.1% in 2001. The increase in gross profit reflects increases for the inclusion of OPB and volume increases in IG's UK business being offset partially by lower pricing in IG, and volume declines in the liquids business of USHP. USHP gross margins were negatively impacted by the production slowdowns related to the first quarter 2002 product recalls and other remedial actions in response to the FDA inspection at its Baltimore plant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's current remediation plan for the Baltimore plant, provided in response to the FDA inspection observation ("Form 483") was submitted to the FDA in October 2002. The plan is estimated to cost approximately $30.0 million, to be substantially completed by mid-2004 and to reduce production at this plant. The Company spent approximately $3.2 million in the fourth quarter 2002, and expects to spend approximately $15.0 million in 2003 and the balance in 2004. In January 2003, the FDA concluded a regularly scheduled review at the Company's Elizabeth plant and issued its observations. In early February, the Company submitted a written reply to the FDA report that included certain corrective actions which are estimated to cost approximately $8.0 million. The current plans for both plants are subject to FDA comment and approval which could change the scope and estimate of cost and require recalls of product.</P>

<B>Selling, General and Administrative Expense ("SGA")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a consolidated basis, SGA expense increased $71.8 million and approximately $90.1 million excluding the effect of goodwill amortization. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of OPB operations, increased expenses related to the implementation of a company wide Enterprise Resource Planning system (a "ERP system") (primarily included in unallocated), increased personnel costs including accruals for incentive compensation in 2002 and higher insurance costs. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating income decreased by $55.4 million and resulted in a loss in 2002 of $31.0 million. Comparison of 2002 to 2001 is complicated by the cessation of amortization for goodwill in 2002, the financial statement revision and identified transactions in both years.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IG's net margin improvement is due to increased volume in a number of markets, offset by lower pricing. API's net margin improvement is due primarily to increased volume in Vancomycin and Amphotericin. USHP's improvement is due to the OPB acquisition offset by lower volume in liquids due to regulatory compliance activities. AH's improvement is due to volume increases in the second half of 2002 relative to 2001. Corporate and unallocated expenses increased due to expenses related to the implementation of a company-wide ERP system, including amortization of capitalized costs commencing in April 2002, and increased personnel costs, including incentive compensation, as management personnel were changed and positions were added.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense was $71.5 million in 2002 compared to $45.5 million in 2001. The increase results from debt incurred to finance the OPB acquisition which was partially offset by debt paydowns from free cash flow, lower interest rates in 2002 and reduced interest expenses on convertible notes which were exchanged for common stock in March 2002.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A discussion of the identified transactions follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPI, primarily within the IG segment, incurred asset impairment and other charges of approximately $15.1 million consisting of severance charges of approximately $1.7 million and impairment losses of $13.4 million relating to product lines in France and Germany which, as part of the 2003 plan process, were determined to be impaired and were written down.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USHP incurred charges of approximately $5.4 million in connection with the OPB acquisition on December 12, 2001, which in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001 and the remaining balance of $5.4 million as the inventory was sold in the first quarter of 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH incurred charges of approximately $152.1 million in 2002 in connection with changes in response to and in anticipation of major challenges in the marketplace and in the way the business will be managed in the future. The AH business, which is in low or no growth competitive markets, will be repositioned to enhance working capital management and cash flow. AH management was changed; there were reductions in workforce at closed plant sites; and positions were eliminated in a number of functions, resulting in severance charges of approximately $3.8 million. AH announced the closing of four facilities which resulted in write-downs and exit costs of $45.2 million (consisting of $40.2 million of asset impairments and $5.0 million of cost of sales). AH announced an impairment charge of $37.1 million (including $1.4 million of cost of sales) for certain tangible and intangible assets related to an AH product, Reporcin. New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure
 resulted in lower forecasted cash flows and a change in strategy to cash generation from growth through new products and technologies and through international market expansion. The lower forecasted cash flows triggered an impairment of all AH goodwill totaling $66.0 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate includes severance charges for management reorganization of $1.3 million, $51.1 million of charges related to the exchange of convertible debt in the first quarter of 2002, ($48.0 million) and write-off of deferred loan costs due to the reduction of the credit line by $150 million ($3.2 million).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company prepaid $85.0 million of term debt and recorded charges classified asextraordinary losses of $1.7 million, or $1.1 million after tax.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues in IG decreased $46.4 million (15.0%) due to lower volume in many of our markets including Germany and the U.K., lower pricing primarily in the UK and Germany and the effects of translation of currencies into the US dollar. The UK market in 2000 had higher prices due to market conditions. These favorable market conditions did not exist in 2001 due to interim market pricing legislation adopted in August of 2000 that had the effect of lowering pricing. In addition, UK competition has increased primarily on higher margin products which has also lowered prices and margins. The interim price regulations are presently being reviewed. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, the present government review of pricing and other aspects of the generic drug market will have on future UK pricing or market conditions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API revenues increased $11.7 million (18.7%) due primarily to increased volume. USHP revenues increased $73.4 million (31.5%) due to increased volume in new and existing products offset in part by lower net pricing. The acquisition of the OPB - U.S. in December 2001 increased revenues by approximately $15.1 million. In connection with the OPB acquisition, the Company noted that certain of OPB's wholesale customers have levels of inventory generally higher than the Company has historically experienced at USPD. OPB management has indicated that these inventory levels are consistent with OPB's historical experience. However, in the event that these customers reduce inventory levels in the future, the Company's revenues could be adversely impacted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal Health revenues increased $34.4 million (11.4%) due to the timing of the MFA acquisition in May 2000 (i.e. seven months in 2000 versus twelve months in 2001). Offsetting increases due to acquisition timing were lower sales in the second half of 2001 versus 2000 due to a change in marketing strategy which reduced certain sales incentives and customer terms. Also impacting sales in Animal Health were unfavorable conditions in the U.S. poultry market, a fire at an important Company shipping location and difficult economic conditions in Asia.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Gross Profit</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Company-wide basis gross profit declined $19.4 million.  Gross margin in 2001 is reduced by the $1.8 million write-off of inventory related to the purchase of OPB and $8.7 million for the disposal of Optibreed inventory in AH. As a percentage of sales, gross profit in 2001 as reported was 39.1%, compared to 44.5% in 2000. The reduction in gross margin represents lower pricing, lower volume and related production inefficiencies as well as F/X effects in IPD offset partially by increases in USPD and FCD due to volume and relatively flat gross profits in AHD. USPD gross profits were negatively impacted by two product recalls which lowered gross profit by approximately $10.0 million in 2001.  AHD gross profits were negatively effected in 2000 by the $1.0 million write-up and subsequent write-off of MFA manufactured inventory.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Operating Expenses</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenses were 36.6% of revenues in 2001 compared to 30.7% of revenues in 2000. The increase in amount of $80.5 million is primarily attributable to $51.1 million of identified transactions and the MFA and OPB acquisitions.</P>

<B>Operating Income</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating income in 2001 decreased by $99.9 million. The Company believes the change in operating income can be approximated as follows:</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense was $45.5 million in 2001 compared to $45.2 million in 2000. Interest expense in 2000 results from debt incurred to finance acquisitions in 2000 and 1999 (primarily MFA and IPD acquisitions) which was partially repaid with proceeds from equity offerings in May and August 2000. The Company began 2001 with $525.1 million of debt and ended 2001 with debt of $1,060.6 million. The increased debt was incurred primarily to fund the OPB acquisition.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P><BR>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>OPB Acquisition</P>
</B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</U>OPB Financing</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2001, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the OPB of Faulding Limited from Mayne Nickless Limited ("Mayne") subject to Mayne's completion of a tender offer for Faulding. The Company was required to make a $145.0 million escrow deposit in July. In October, the Company obtained management control of OPB, subject to certain limitations. In October, to fund the $660.0 million purchase price to Mayne, the Company released the $145.0 million escrow, paid an additional $255.0 million and provided a $260.0 million letter of credit. In December the acquisition closed and the letter of credit was funded. The OPB is included in the Company's results from December 12, 2001, the date of acquisition. The identified transactions include the interest expense and letter of credit fees related to the prepayments during the July-December period of $8.4 million and a charge of $2.3 million included in other, net for bank fees primarily for the bridge financing, net
 of interest income on the escrow deposit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new financing required for the OPB resulted in the repayment and termination of the 1999 Credit Facility. The write-off of the bank fees related to the early extinguishment of debt ($2.2 million pre-tax, $1.3 million net of tax) are also included with the identified transactions.</P>
<U>
</U><P>Purchase Accounting</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&amp;D"). IPR&amp;D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&amp;D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&amp;D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced f
or a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Combination of OPB with USPD and Other Acquisition Expenses</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon acquisition, the OPB was combined with the USPD to create U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals. The combination resulted in severance charges of $4.8 million related to USPD employees. In addition, the IPD commenced the closure of its Copenhagen Research Facility resulting in severance of approximately $1.5 million. The Company intends to conduct its oral solid research at the OPB facilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2001, the Company incurred acquisition expenses for professional and consulting services of $3.3 million related to the OPB.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the transactions identified with the OPB acquisition resulted in a net loss of $52.4 million or $1.28 per share.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>De-leveraging Activities</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company significantly increased its debt in connection with the OPB acquisition. The credit facilities entered into in connection with the acquisition of OPB and the refinancing of existing debt contain various financial covenants, operating restrictions and require the repayment of debt on a scheduled basis. The Company is in compliance with all of the terms of the credit facilities and believes it will be able to comply in the future. In order to ensure continued compliance and increase flexibility under the agreements, the Company intends to continue to de-leverage. Toward this goal, the Company has adopted a comprehensive de-leveraging plan, which includes aggressive expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets. The Company has continued to pursue these alternatives to further reduce debt.  (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for 2002 de-leveraging activities).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, the Company exchanged $34.1 million of 5.75% subordinated debentures for approximately 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock and recorded a non-cash expense of $7.4 million. Additionally, in December 2001, the Company repaid term loans of $65.0 million and recorded an extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt ($1.5 million pre-tax, $.9 million after tax). The sum of these 2001 de-leveraging activities resulted in a loss of approximately $6.8 million ($.17 per share).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Reorganization, Refocus and Other Transactions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Animal Health</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2001, the Company changed management in its Animal Health business. The change in management resulted in severance charges of $1.1 million. New management began a review of current projects and decided to discontinue support of certain projects including the commercialization of the Optibreed product. This decision resulted in a charge for disposal of Optibreed inventory of $8.7 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
HPI</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of IG and API resulted in severance charges of $2.8 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Other Items</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other identified transactions, which net to $.4 million of expense include income of $2.1 million from the settlement of vitamin litigation in the second quarter 2001 offset by the write-off of investments of $2.5 million including an equity position in the company which manufactured the optibreed product.</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of the reorganization, refocus and other transactions is a loss, net of taxes, of $7.9 million ($.19 per share).<BR>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 as reported includes charges related to the Roche MFA acquisition which are included in the cost of sales ($1.0 million), selling, general and administrative ($.4 million), and other, net ($4.7 million).  These charges, net after tax, totaled approximately $4.0 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Inflation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of inflation on the Company's operations during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was not significant.</P>

<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. All professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 2002, have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  The Company has chosen to highlight certain policies that it considers critical to the operations of the business and understanding its consolidated financial statements:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Revenue Recognition</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
In the Company's US Human Pharmaceutical business, and to a lesser extent in Human Pharmaceuticals - International, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, or other managed-care reserves. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. The Company estimates these rebates, chargebacks, managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs. The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has completed several acquisitions since 1998, which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization.   The values assigned to goodwill and intangibles, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by the Company.  In addition, in 2002, upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and reviewed goodwill upon transition and at year end for impairment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations. These allocations, including an assessment of estimated useful lives, have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies. Valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset, including historical cash flows.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Asset Impairments</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a dimunition in value may have occurred, based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset. If the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.  Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the Company, including the determination of an event indicating impairment; the future cash flows to be generated by the asset, including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action; the risk associated with those cash flows; and the Company's cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Research and Development ("R&amp;D"), Including In-Process R&amp;D ("IPR&amp;D")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to completed acquisitions, acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility, signified by FDA or comparable regulatory body approval, are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits.   Estimates of the values  of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&amp;D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.   </P>
<P><BR>
<B>Inventories</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for most inventories, with certain US Human Pharmaceutical inventory values on a last-in, first-out basis. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Reserves are recorded for inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation. The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.   </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employee Benefit Plans</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirements, post employment and health care benefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on the calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates, and health care cost and trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries.</P>
<B>
<P>Litigation and Contingencies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and also to certain other contingencies (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 17 to the financial statements).  The Company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred. Additionally, the Company assesses, in consultation with its counsel, the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis.  Reserves are recorded when the Company, in consultation with counsel, determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>Income Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset.  In the event the Company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is recorded.  The Company's valuation allowance principally relates to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Liquidity and Capital Resources<BR>
</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2002, stockholders' equity was $1,005.2 million compared to $891.6 million and $847.9 million at December&nbsp;31, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The ratio of long-term debt to equity was .84:1, 1.16:1 and .59:1 at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2002 mainly represents the exchanges of convertible notes to equity and miscellaneous equity issuances totaling $142.7 million and $79.0 million of other comprehensive income primarily due a positive currency translation adjustment reflecting the weakening in 2002 of the U.S. dollar, offset by a net loss of $98.8 million, and dividends of $9.2 million. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2001 represents equity issuances primarily due to exchanges of convertible debentures for common stock offset by the 2001 net loss and a negative currency translation adjustment. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2000 primarily reflects the issuance o
f common stock in 2000 resulting from the $472.8 million equity offerings and net income partially offset by the currency translation adjustment. In 2000, senior debt was paid down with a portion of the proceeds from the equity offerings. In 2001, long-term debt increased to finance the OPB acquisition. In 2002, the Company reduced long-term debt by approximately $181.0 million due to exchange of convertible debentures for equity and repayment of $86.0 million of long term debt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital at December 31, 2002, was $296.2 million compared to $319.4 million and $394.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. The current ratio was 1.79:1 at December&nbsp;31, 2002 compared to 1.93:1 and 2.91:1 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flow from operations in 2002 was $162.2 million compared to $119.4 million and $33.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset writedowns and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&amp;D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. Additionally, the Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding year by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH in the 4<SUP>th</SUP> quarter of 2001 and an emphasis on accounts receivable management are the main reasons for these declines. Cash flow from operations in 2000 was n
egatively impacted by the structure of the MFA acquisition. The MFA acquisition did not include existing MFA accounts receivable and accordingly, the increase in accounts receivable as sales were made is reflected as a reduction in operating cash flow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance sheet amounts increased as of December 31, 2002 compared to December 2001 in U.S. Dollars as the functional currencies of the Company's principal foreign subsidiaries, the Norwegian Krone, Danish Krone, the Euro, and British Pound, appreciated versus the U.S. Dollar by approximately 30%, 19%, 19% and 11%, respectively. These increases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios. The approximate increase due to currency translation of selected captions was: accounts receivable $12.6 million, inventories $14.7 million, accounts payable and accrued expenses $13.3 million, and total stockholder's equity $79.0 million. The $79.0 million increase in stockholder's equity is included in other comprehensive loss for the year and results from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in 2002 against all major functional currencies of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, the Company's capital expenditures including expenditures for purchased dossiers and for a Company wide ERP system were $81.7 million. In 2003, the Company plans to spend approximately the same amount. The Company has approved a number of capital projects including the construction of an additional API capacity in Copenhagen, and a company-wide information technology project which is expected to require additional capital expenditures of approximately $12.0 million through 2004.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2002, the Company had $24.0 million in cash and available short-term lines of credit of approximately $12.9 million and $99.0 million available under its 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the Company's short-term and long-term debt is at variable interest rates. The 2001 Credit Facility requires the Company enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on 50% of its debt. During 2002, the Company entered into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for $265.0 million of its variable rate debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates. The Company's policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the OPB and entered into a $900.0 million credit facility ("2001 Credit Facility") to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement.  The 2001 Credit Facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  The calculation of EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests.  The interest coverage ratio is, and is expected to be, the most restrictive of the covenants.  Certain of these covenants became more restrictive as of December 31, 2002 and will become more restrictive for each year thereafter through 2004. The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of De
cember 31, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued compliance with these financial covenants in 2003 is dependent on the Company's EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement, and therefore the Company's ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income, or on the Company's ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt.  The Company undertook certain actions in the fourth quarter of 2001 and in 2002 to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt as part of an overall de-leveraging plan.  The de-leveraging plan includes expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets.  Under this plan, the Company in December 2001 prepaid term debt of $65.0 million and exchanged common shares for $34.1 million of convertible subordinated debt.  In 2002, the Company prepaid $85.0 million of term debt and exchanged common shares for approximately $110.0 million of convertible subordinated debt. Additionally, in December 2002, the Company amended the 2001 Credit Facility whi
ch included covenant relief for certain fourth quarter charges and reduced the line of credit by $150.0 million. On an overall basis, senior debt and total debt at December 31, 2002 were $520.2 million and $895.9 million, respectively, compared to $581.5 million and $1,060.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above actions, combined with operating profit currently forecasted for 2003, the Company fully expects to comply with these covenants throughout 2003.  During 2002, the FDA conducted reviews of the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth manufacturing facilities.  In connection with these reviews, the Company was issued several comments included in Form 483's.  As a result, the Company has responded to the FDA and is implementing an extensive remediation plan expected to be substantially completed by mid-2004 and cost approximately $38 million.  The total cost and timing of the remediation plan may change based upon the FDA responses.  Furthermore, additional assessments performed by the Company pursuant to either or both of the plans or in response to FDA comments may lead to either additional expense, additional capital expenditure for plant improvements, product recalls or revenue reduction related to further decreases in production capacity.  The Company's 2003 operat
ing profit forecast assumes corrective actions and productions levels at the two USHP plants consistent with its responses to the FDA.  Significant deviation from the Company's remediation plan could have a material effect on compliance with the covenants in 2003.  The Company believes it has the ability to further reduce operating or capital expenditures and sufficient sources of funds such that debt could be further reduced if additional actions become necessary to comply with the covenants. The Company continues to review options, including price increases, asset sales and organizational and business structure changes to reduce its cost base and improve profitability. Certain of these actions may require the consent of the parties to the credit facility.</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company's risk management practice includes the selective use, on a limited basis, of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements. Such instruments are used for purposes other than trading.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in U.S. Dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies. The Company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations. The Company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2002, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $132.6 million. The fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material. All contracts expire in the first three quarters of 2003. The cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non-functional currency transactions. The change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than $6.0 million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable. Such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Interest Rate Risk</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma's interest rate risk relates primarily to long-term and short-term debt which has variable interest rates and reset generally every three months. At December 31, 2002 the Company has $460.8 million of variable rate U.S. Dollar debt under its 2001 Credit Agreement. The 2001 Credit Agreement required the Company have at least 50% of its total debt at fixed interest rates or have interest rate protection with an initial average life of 3 years for the amount of variable rate debt necessary to have fixed and interest rate protected debt at least equal to 50% of total debt. As required in early 2002, the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap for three years for $100.0 million of debt. In late 2002 and early 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swaps for an additional $265.0 million to fix interest rates for 2003. The Company's purpose was to fix rates to comply with the credit facility and lock in interest rates for 2003.</P>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has implemented a formal disclosure procedure designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Report, is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO as appropriate and in a timely manner. The disclosure procedure involves participation by various individuals in the Company who have access to material information relating to the operations of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 90 days prior to the date of this report (the "Evaluation Date"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, they concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to timely alert them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) which is required to be included in the Company's Exchange Act filings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in Internal Controls</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls, or to the Company's knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect the Company's internal controls and procedures subsequent to the Evaluation Date. During 2002, significant actions were taken by the Company to address deficiencies in certain internal controls which were discussed with the Company's Audit Committee and formally documented by the Company's independent auditors as reportable conditions in their communication to the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors in connection with their audit of the Company's December 31, 2001 financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reportable conditions involve matters relating to significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that, in an auditor's judgment, could adversely affect a company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's auditors identified the following two reportable conditions in connection with their audit of the 2001 Financial Statements: (i) unclear reporting relationships between the Company's corporate finance division and the finance officers of the individual operating divisions, resulting in the corporate finance division's inability to directly and effectively oversee the finance activities of the operating divisions, and (ii) lack of formal Company wide accounting policies and procedures.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has resolved the reportable conditions by taking the following actions: (i) the Company has made changes and additions in key finance personnel and has established clear reporting relationships, (ii) the Company has standardized and expanded the scope of monthly and quarterly financial review procedures, (iii) the Company completed a review, through an international accounting firm, of the internal controls of the Animal Health business which was the subject of the Company's 2001 restatement, (iv) the Company engaged an international accounting firm to establish an internal audit function and (v) the Company has introduced formal accounting policies relating to significant risk areas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.</P>

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is 
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index on page F-1 of this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alpharma Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a t
est basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January&nbsp;1, 2002.</P>

The Class B stock represents 23.1% of the total outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2002. A.L. Industrier, a Norwegian company, is able to control the Company through its ability to elect more than a majority of the Board of Directors and to cast a majority of the votes in any non-class vote of the Company's stockholders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IG and API are part of Human Pharmaceuticals International ("HPI") which has a single management team and infastructure and is responsible for both segments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IG's principal products are dosage form pharmaceuticals sold primarily in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and western Europe as well as Indonesia, China and certain middle eastern countries. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The API's principal products are bulk pharmaceutical antibiotics sold to the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and worldwide for use as active substances in a number of finished pharmaceuticals. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USHP's principal products are generic liquid and topical pharmaceuticals and solid dose oral pharmaceuticals both generic and branded. USHP sells primarily to wholesalers, distributors, and merchandising chains.</P>

<DIR>

<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</U>:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><BR>
Principles of consolidation:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentations.</P>
<P><BR>
Use of estimates:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Cash equivalents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less.  </P>
<P><BR>
Inventories:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for most inventories, with certain U.S. Human Pharmaceutical inventory values on a last-in, first-out basis.  The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices.  Reserves are recorded for inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation.  The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained, litigation will be resolved unfavorably, or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors.  See Note 18 for additional information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Property, plant and equipment:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.  When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss included in net income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciable assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. A loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the assets. Fair value is determined based upon a market quote, if available, or is based on valuation techniques.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest is capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of major construction and software development projects.  In 2002, 2001 and 2000, $1,904, $2,232, and $1,265 of interest costs were capitalized, respectively.</P>

<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives which are generally as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Goodwill and Intangible Assets:</P>
<P><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1, 2002 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 142 applies to all goodwill and intangibles acquired in a business combination. Under SFAS 142, all goodwill and certain intangibles determined to have indefinite lives, acquired before initial application of the standard, will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of the statement, and at least annually thereafter. Intangible assets other than goodwill will be amortized over their useful lives, generally 5-20 years, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  See Note 12 for additional detail relating to the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Foreign currency translation and transactions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations are translated using average rates in effect during the year.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in income.  Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The foreign currency translation adjustment for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is net of $(1,910), $318 and $1,187, respectively, representing the foreign tax effects associated with long-term intercompany advances to foreign subsidiaries.</P>
<P><BR>
Derivative Instruments:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and its corresponding amendments under SFAS No. 138, (referred to hereafter as "SFAS 133"), on January 1, 2001. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized periodically in earnings or stockholders' equity, depending on the intended use of the derivative and whether the derivative is classified as a hedging instrument. Changes in fair value of the derivative instrument not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedging relationships. All cash flow hedges are linked directly to specific transactions and the Company assesses effectiveness at inception and on a quarterly basis. When it is determined that a derivative instrument is not highly effective or the transaction is no longer deemed probable of occurring, the Company discontinues hedge accounting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's derivative instruments, which are entered into on a limited basis, consist principally of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. These instruments are entered into in order to manage exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company carries its derivative instruments at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value of foreign currency forwards in current period earnings and changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps, which are classified as cash flow hedges, in stockholders' equity. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company selectively enters into foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell certain cash flows in non-functional currencies and to hedge certain firm commitments due in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange contracts, other than hedges of firm commitments, are accounted for as foreign currency transactions and gains or losses are included in income. Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction when it is completed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Revenue Recognition:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers.  Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Company's U.S. Human Pharmaceutical business, and to a lesser extent in Human Pharmaceuticals - International, sales to certain customers require that the Company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, chargebacks, or other managed-care reserves.  Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions.  The Company estimates these rebates, chargebacks, managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience.  The Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income taxes:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities between amounts recorded for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2002, the Company's share of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, (excluding cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments), was approximately $148,000. No provisions are made for U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of earnings which have been reinvested abroad or are expected to be returned in tax-free distributions. It is the Company's policy to provide for U.S. taxes payable with respect to earnings which the Company plans to repatriate.</P>

Accounting for stock-based compensation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2002, the Company has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 22. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to stock-based employee compensation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use".  Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations".  SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs.  The Company has determined the effects on its financial statements resulting from adoption will not be material.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the new rules continue previous guidance to recognize impairment when the undiscounted cash flows will not recover its carrying amount. The impairment to be recognized will continue to be measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The computation of fair value now removes goodwill from consideration and incorporates a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach. The previous guidance provided in SFAS 121 is to be applied to assets to be disposed of by sale. Long-lived assets to be disposed by other than sale will now recognize impairment at the date of disposal, but will be considered assets to be held and 
used until that time. The Company adopted SFAS 144 as of January 1, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>In May 2002 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FAS 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002".  The statement rescinds SFAS 4 (as amended by SFAS 64), which required extraordinary item treatment for gains and losses on extinguishments of debt, and SFAS 44, which does not affect the Company. Additionally, the statement amends certain provisions of SFAS 13 and other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS 145 related to extinguishments of debt are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2003, and all other provisions are effective for transactions occurring on or financial statements issued after May&nbsp;5, 2002.  The 
Company has determined the effects on its financial statements resulting from adoption will not be material.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities".  This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)".  This Statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in Issue 94-3, and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  This Statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.  SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. Any charges associated with future restructuring pro
grams will be recorded in accordance with SFAS 146. This will spread the recognition of the restructuring expenses over a number of accounting periods as compared to EITF 94-3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 31, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure". Statement 148 amends FASB Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition to Statement 123's fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Statement 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of statement 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting", to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity's accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. While the Statement does not amend Statement 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of Statement 148 are applicable to all comp
anies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of Statement 123 or the intrinsic value method of Opinion 25. Statement 148's amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of Statement 123 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of FAS 148 as of December 31, 2002, and will continue to use the intrinsic value method of APB 25.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" was issued.  FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.  The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 21, 2002.

The 2001 Credit Facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test, a maximum senior leverage ratio test, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test, a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test.  The calculation of EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility, on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests.

The de-leveraging plan includes expense, capital spending and working capital controls and possible sale of assets.  Under this plan, the Company in December 2001 prepaid term debt of $65,000 and exchanged common shares for $34,100 of convertible subordinated debt.  In 2002, the Company prepaid $85,000 of term debt and exchanged common shares for approximately $110,000 of convertible subordinated debt. Additionally, in December 2002, the Company amended the 2001
 Credit Facility which included covenant relief for certain fourth quarter charges and reduced the revolving line of credit by $150,000. On an overall basis, senior debt and total debt at December 31, 2002 were $520,153 and $895,858, respectively, compared to $581,511 and $1,060,592, respectively, at December 31, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above actions, combined with operating profit and cash flow currently forecasted for 2003, the Company fully expects to comply with these covenants throughout 2003.  During 2002, the FDA conducted reviews of the Company's Baltimore and Elizabeth manufacturing facilities.  In connection with these reviews, the Company was issued several comments included in Form 483's.  As a result, the Company has responded to the FDA and is implementing an extensive remediation plan expected to be completed by mid-2004  and cost approximately $38,000.  The total cost and timing of the remediation plan may change based upon the FDA responses.  Furthermore, additional assessments performed by the Company pursuant to either or both of the plans or in response to FDA comments may lead to either additional expense, additional capital expenditure for plant improvements, product recalls or revenue reduction related to further decreases in production levels. The Company's
 2003 operating profit forecast assumes corrective actions and production levels at the two USHP plants consistent with its responses to the FDA.  Significant deviation from the Company's remediation plan could significantly impact the Company's ability to comply with the 2003 covenants. The Company believes it has the ability to further reduce operating or capital expenditures and sufficient sources of funds such that debt could be further reduced if additional actions become necessary to comply with the covenants. The Company continues to review options, including price increases, asset sales and organizational and business structure changes to reduce its cost base and improve profitability and cash flow. Certain of these actions may require the consent of the parties to the credit facility.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 12, 2001, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the generic and proprietary oral solid dose pharmaceuticals business ("OPB acquisition") in the U.S. and China of F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited from Mayne Nickless Limited for total consideration of $660,000 in cash (approximately $669,800 including direct acquisition related costs). On October 2, 2001, Mayne closed its tender offer for Faulding's shares after having accepted the tender of more than 90% of Faulding's shares. On October 5, 2001, Alpharma gained operational and economic control of OPB subject to certain limitations. On December 12, 2001 Mayne acquired 100% of Faulding's shares and transferred the OPB to the Company in accordance with the acquisition agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations". The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of OPB operations are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition, December 12, 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of the Oral Pharmaceuticals Business includes the operations of Purepac Pharmaceuticals and Faulding Laboratories in the United States and Foshan Faulding Pharmaceutical China. The Oral Pharmaceuticals Business includes research, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing of generic and proprietary oral solid dose pharmaceuticals in the United States and China.  In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, the OPB had net sales of $205,200 (unaudited) comprised of US net sales of $190,700 (unaudited) and China net sales of $14,500 (unaudited). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&amp;D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&amp;D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as fol

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;2, 2000, Alpharma announced the completion of the acquisition of the Medicated Feed Additive Business of Roche Ltd. ("MFA") for a cash payment of approximately $258,000 and issuance of a $30,000 promissory note to Roche.  The Note was paid in full in December 2000. In addition, certain international inventories were purchased from Roche during a transition period of approximately three months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MFA business had 1999 sales of $213,000 and consists of products used in the livestock and poultry industries for preventing and treating diseases in animals. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition included inventories, five manufacturing and formulation sites in the United States, global product registrations, licenses, trademarks and associated intellectual property. Approximately 200 employees, primarily in manufacturing and sales and marketing, were included in the acquisition.  The Company is amortizing the acquired intangibles over 20 years using the straight-line method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company financed the $258,000 cash payment under a $225,000 Bridge Financing Agreement ("Bridge Financing") with the balance of the financing being provided under its then current $300,000 credit facility ("1999 Credit Facility").  The Bridge Financing was arranged by Union Bank of Norway, First Union National Bank, and a group of other banks and was fully repaid on June 29, 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bridge Financing the Company paid a 1% fee for the banks commitment and in connection with drawing the funds. Interest was payable at Libor plus 2.75%. In addition, because of the size of the acquisition, other possible acquisitions, and the existing restrictive covenants under the 1999 Credit Facility, the Company engaged and incurred fees to investment bankers to advise on alternatives and strategies to finance the Roche acquisition. All fees relating to the Bridge Financing were expensed in the second quarter of 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact on cost of sales of the write-up of inventory to net realizable value pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations", was reflected in cost of sales, as acquired manufactured inventory was sold during the second quarter of 2000. In addition, certain employees of AHD were severed as a result of the acquisition and resulted in severance expense in the second quarter of 2000.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company incurred charges as a result of management actions intended to improve future operations. The IG and API combined to form HPI and incurred charges of approximately $4,300 primarily for severance of 79 employees.  All employees were severed by June 30, 2002. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in Note 4, as part of the combination of USPD and OPB - US, severance charges of approximately $4,800 were expensed for 39 USPD employees. In addition, severance accruals of approximately $1,700 for 19 OPB - US employees were included in the purchase price allocation.  All employees were severed by June 30, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH changed three senior managers in the fourth quarter of 2001 and severance of approximately $1,100 was incurred. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, new AH management in its review of current projects decided to discontinue support of the optibreed project and incurred charges of approximately $11,200 to reflect the write-down of optibreed inventory and the equity investment in the company which manufactured optibreed inventory.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 2002, the Company became aware of process deficiencies, which occurred in 2001 for two products sold by USHP.  One of these products was manufactured by a contract manufacturer.  Based on the nature of the deficiencies, the Company determined that a voluntary recall of these products from its direct customers was required.  Accordingly, at December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $10,700 for these recalls, consisting primarily of inventory write-offs for unsaleable product and estimated disposal costs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH incurred charges in connection with changes in response to and in anticipation of major challenges in the marketplace and in the way the business will be managed in the future. The AH business, which is in low or no growth competitive markets, will be repositioned to enhance working capital management and cash flow. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>Southern Cross and Reporcin (AH)</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1999, AH acquired the business of Southern Cross Biotech, Pty. Ltd. ("Southern Cross") and the exclusive worldwide license for Reporcin, a product which is used to aid in the production of leaner pork meat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the license agreement, additional payments are required as regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets. The Company also was required to complete an FDA approved production facility for Reporcin to complement the acquired Reporcin manufacturing facility. To meet that requirement, the Company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana in June 2000 and began to prepare the facility for production of Reporcin. In early 2002, the Company commissioned an independent study to re-evaluate the market potential of Reporcin in the U.S. market. At the same time the Company halted the work to prepare the Terre Haute facility for Reporcin production. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2002 the Company received the results of the independent study on the market viability in the U.S. for Reporcin. The study identified a number of business risks that translated into slower market penetration and lower cash flows than previously forecasted. As a result of the revised expected value of the Reporcin in the U.S., the Company has decided to sell the Terre Haute facility and wrote-down the facility to its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company incurred an impairment charge related to the building and fixed assets of $16,353 and accrued for certain exit and shut-down costs in the amount of $2,342.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study also caused the Company to reassess the forecasts of future sales of Reporcin in markets where the Company has regulatory approval. The current intangible and prepaid royalty balances totaling approximately $21,800 for these markets were compared by market to the undiscounted cash flows. Since impairment was indicated, discounted cash flows were prepared and an impairment charge of $17,023 was recorded. The Company also has re-evaluated the carrying value of the Reporcin manufacturing facility and inventory on hand and wrote-down the inventory to the lower of cost or market, thereby incurring a charge of $1,382.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to investigate alternative methods to service the U.S. market and will continue to market Reporcin in markets where registrations have been received.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P>Impairment - AH Goodwill</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the required annual 2002 impairment test, the entire goodwill of Animal Health was written-off resulting in a charge of $66,011. (See Note 12.) New competitive entrants combined with significant price pressure resulted in lower forecasted cash flows.  The former strategy of growth through new products, technologies and international market expansion was changed to a strategy to maximize cash generation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH Facility Closures</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In connection with the Company's repositioning and cash generation strategy, in December 2002, the Company announced the closing of four Animal Health facilities, certain asset write-downs and work force reductions.  The facility closings included plants in Missouri, Arkansas, Australia and a research center in New Jersey which resulted in write-downs and exit costs of $45,192 (consisting of $40,144 of asset impairments and $5,048 of cost of sales).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Impairment - IG Intangible Assets</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter 2002, all significant intangible assets were tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". Due to a increased competitive influence in these marketplaces and continued government regulation, the Company determined intangible assets for specific products for the German and French markets needed to be tested and were determined to be impaired. Impairment charges totaling $13,487 were recorded in the fourth quarter based on results of a probability weighted cash flow assessment or independent market valuation.  </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2000, the Company's Danish subsidiary sold the patents, trademarks, marketing authorizations, and inventory related to the Elyzol Dental Gel ("EDG") product for cash proceeds of approximately $8,250. Concurrently with this sale, and due to the specialized nature of the manufacturing process for EDG, the Company entered into a Toll Manufacturing Agreement with the purchaser under which the Company will continue to manufacture EDG for the purchaser for a four year period. The Company is reimbursed for direct manufacturing costs plus an agreed upon amount for overhead and a variable manufacturing profit which declines as production volumes increase. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the relative fair value of the assets sold and the Company's toll manufacturing obligation cannot be reliably estimated, the Company deferred, as of July 2000, the entire excess of the cash proceeds over the carrying amount of the assets sold and expenses associated with the sale. The deferral initially amounted to approximately $7,800 and is being amortized over the four year term of the Toll Manufacturing agreement on a straight-line basis, which management believes will approximate amortization using the units of production method. Income from the Transition Service Agreement and the contractual profit under the Toll Manufacturing Agreement are being recognized as services are provided or goods are sold to the purchaser.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Frutiger 45 Light" SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately $1,900, $1,900 and $1,000 of the deferral was recognized as income in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The remaining balance of approximately $2,900 has been deferred; $1,950 is included in accrued expenses and $950 is classified as other non-current liabilities.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the Company entered into loan and other agreements with Ascent Pediatrics, Inc. ("Ascent") under which the Company ultimately provided $12,000 in loans due in 2005.  In December 2000, the Company acquired a product line from Ascent in exchange for the cancellation of the $12,000 in outstanding loans and the termination of the existing financing and option agreements. In addition, the Company agreed to make a new fully collateralized short-term loan to Ascent of up to $6,250. During 2001, the Company loaned $6,250 and was fully repaid when Ascent was acquired by another company.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net intangible asset reclassifications represent product rights (as discussed above) which had been separately identified but which had been classified as goodwill for financial reporting purposes prior to the adoption of SFAS 142. All goodwill is not subject to amortization as of January 1, 2002. The Company assigned intangibles and goodwill to identified reporting units, completed the transitional impairment test as required, and determined that there was no impairment of existing goodwill as of January 1, 2002. This assessment was made utilizing forecasted cash flows discounted at a rate of 11%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As required in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company performed the required annual test for impairment. The assessment was made in conjunction with the budgeting and long-range planning by each segment. The assessment utilized essentially the same methodology as the initial testing. The Animal Health segment indicated a possible impairment due to emerging external factors which included increasing competition, and lower prices. Additionally, the Company re-evaluated its prior growth plans internationally and domestically for new and existing products. The re-evaluation indicated growth prospects had diminished and the segment should be operated to maximize cash generation. The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to perform step two testing and, as a result, wrote off all of the Animal Health goodwill, totaling $66,011.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December 31, 2001, and 2000 the Consolidated Statement of Operations adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill and related taxes is as follows:</P>

<U><P>Senior debt<BR>
</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpharma Operating Corporation ("Alpharma Operating Corporation"), and certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement ("2001 Credit Facility") with the Bank of America, N.A. and a syndicate of lending institutions that provides up to a maximum of $900,000 of senior credit facilities. The 2001 Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and a pledge of 65% of the shares of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.  The agreement replaced the prior revolving credit facility, provided the funds required for the acquisition of OPB and related financing costs and increased overall credit availability. The 1999 revolving credit facility was repaid on October 5, 2001 by drawing down on the 2001 Credit Facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At closing, the 2001 Credit Facility provided for (i) a $300,000 six year revolving credit facility; (ii) a $175,000 six year Term Loan A; and (iii) a $425,000 seven year Term Loan B.  In December 2001 the Company prepaid $65,000 of the Term A and Term B loans resulting in the maximum amount available to be borrowed under the 2001 Credit Facility being reduced to $835,000.  In 2002, the Company prepaid an additional $85,000 of the Term A and Term B loans. As a result of the $85,000 term loan reduction, the Company has recorded an extraordinary expense for the early extinguishment of debt of $1,791 ($1,101 after tax) in 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2002, the 2001 Credit Facility was amended to reduce the revolving credit facility to $150,000. As a result of the modification to the revolving debt arrangement, the Company recognized the related portion of unamortized costs in the statement of income in the amount of $3,176 (classified in other, net). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility has several financial covenants including a total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio, senior debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio (see Note 3).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the 2001 Credit Facility the Company is required to have a specified percentage of its indebtedness at a fixed interest rate. To comply with this requirement, in January 2002 the Company entered into a standard interest rate swap in order to fix the interest rate on $60,000 of its variable rate borrowings under the 2001 credit facility.   As a result of an additional reduction in fixed rate indebtedness due to the exchanges of subordinated debt in March 2002 (discussed below), the Company settled this interest rate swap and entered into a standard interest rate swap to effectively fix the interest rate on $100,000 of its variable rate borrowings at a fixed rate of 7.7% as of December 31, 2002. The Company reviews and renews its swap requirements on a quarterly basis. The Company accounts for this swap as a cash flow hedge. Unrealized losses of approximately $3,267, net of related tax benefits, are included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Stock
holders' Equity as a component of comprehensive income (loss).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial covenants, the 2001 Credit Facility has a number of non-financial provisions including a requirement that AL Industrier ("ALI") maintain control over the Company. ALI currently beneficially owns all of the Company's Class B shares which carries the right to elect a majority of the Company's directors. The continuation of ALI's control of the Company is subject to the unilateral actions of ALI and the maintenance by ALI of certain collateral value under ALI's bank loan agreement (the "ALI Facility") (which includes a computation based, in part, on the agreed upon value of the Company's Class B shares beneficially owned by ALI).  Assuming the value of the other collateral assets remains constant, to the extent the ALI Facility is at its maximum loan value of $33,000, if the value of the Company's Class B shares falls below approximately $3.50 per share (based upon the per share market value of the Company's Class A shares), the ALI Facility lenders c
ould call a default. In the event of a default or if Industrier does not fully pay or refinance its bank loan at its June 30, 2003 maturity date, Industrier's bankers may act to enforce their security over the shares in the ALI subsidiaries which hold the Company's Class B shares. Such action would change the beneficial ownership of the Company's Class B shares, unless ALI takes steps to repay the ALI Facility or cure the default in a manner satisfactory to the ALI Facility lenders, prior to such action. A change in beneficial ownership of the Company's Class B shares would constitute a change in control and a default under the 2001 Credit Facility.  Other default provisions under the ALI Facility could result in a similar effect under the 2001 Credit Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 Credit Facility's Term A is payable in quarterly installments ranging from $5,591 to $6,523 through 2007.  The Term B is payable in quarterly installments of $794 with balloon payment of $296,019 in 2008.  In the event that more than $10,000 of either the 05 Notes or 06 Notes are outstanding within six months of their due date, the entire remaining balance of the Term A, Term B and the Revolving Credit becomes due and payable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 5, 2001, the Company provided a $260,000 letter of credit for the benefit of Mayne related to the  OPB Acquisition. In addition, bridge financing was needed to finance the purchase price prior to the issuance of the senior subordinated note. All costs and fees associated with the letter of credit and bridge financing were capitalized and amortized over the period they were outstanding (October 5 through December 12, 2001).  On December 12, 2001 the letter of credit and Bridge financing were cancelled.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has issued Industrial Development Revenue Bonds in connection with various expansion projects. At December 31, 2002 bonds with a $2,500 principal amount require monthly interest payments at a floating rate approximating the current money market rate on tax exempt bonds plus agency and other fees (total rate approximately 4.5%). Bonds with a $2,940 principal amount require fixed interest payments of between 6.875% and 7.25%. The bonds are payable in varying amounts through 2009. Plant and equipment with an approximate net book value of $19,664 serve as collateral for these loans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortgage notes payable denominated in Norwegian Kroner (NOK) include amounts issued in connection with the construction and subsequent expansion of a pharmaceutical facility in Lier, Norway. The mortgage is collateralized by this facility (net book value $35,600). The debt was borrowed in a number of tranches over the construction period and interest is fixed for specified periods based on actual yields of Norgeskreditt publicly traded bonds plus a lending margin of 0.70%. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 7.6%. The tranches are repayable in semiannual installments through 2021.  Yearly principal payments are approximately $1,300.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgage notes payable also included amounts issued in 1997 ($5,356) to finance a production unit at an Aquatic Animal Health facility in Overhalla, Norway. These amounts were repaid in full during 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<U>Subordinated debt</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12% Senior subordinated notes:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2001, in connection with the formal closing of the OPB acquisition, Alpharma Operating Corporation sold $200,000 in principal amount of 12% senior subordinated notes due 2009 to affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and CIBC World Markets Corp. The notes are guaranteed by the Company and the principal domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The notes include restrictive covenants similar to those included in the 2001 Credit Facility but are generally less restrictive. These notes replaced the bridge financing facility which was in place prior to the closing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield on the 12% Senior subordinated notes due 2009 ("09 Notes") increased to 12.5% when the Company's corporate debt outlook was reduced by a major credit rating agency in July 2002. The increase of .5% to be accreted was effective as of September 1, 2002 and at December 31, 2002 accreted interest increased the notes by $293.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is contractually obligated to assist the original holders of the 09 Notes in selling the notes.  Should the yield on the re-sold notes be less than 12.5%, the Company is obligated to pay the present value of differences in yields to the original holders of the 09 Notes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1999, the Company issued $170,000 principal amount of 3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "06 Notes"). The 06 Notes pay cash interest of 3% per annum, calculated on the initial principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2006 at a price of 134.104% of the initial principal amount. The payment of the principal amount of the Notes at maturity (or earlier, if the Notes are redeemed by the Company prior to maturity), together with cash interest paid over the term of the Notes, will yield investors 6.875% per annum. The interest accrued but which will not be paid prior to maturity (3.875% per annum) is reflected as long-term debt in the accounts of the Company. The 06 Notes are redeemable by the Company after June 16, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 06 Notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into 31.1429 shares of the Company's Class A Common stock per one thousand dollars of initial principal amount of 06 Notes. This ratio results in an initial conversion price of $32.11 per share. The number of shares into which a 06 Note is convertible will not be adjusted for the accretion of principal or for accrued interest. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2002, the Company completed an exchange of 3,433,104 shares of its Class A Common Stock for a portion of its 06 Notes having an approximate principal value of $53,400.  The exchange resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $26,982 ($16,487 after tax) in the first quarter of 2002 (classified in Other, net).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, the Company issued $125,000 of 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "05 Notes") due 2005. The 05 Notes may be converted into common stock at $28.594 at any time prior to maturity, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company may redeem the 05 Notes, in whole or in part, at a premium plus accrued interest.  Concurrently, A.L. Industrier, the controlling stockholder of the Company, purchased at par for cash $67,850 principal amount of a Convertible Subordinated Note (the "Industrier Note"). The Industrier Note had substantially identical adjustment terms and interest rate as the 05 Notes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2002, the Company has state loss carryforwards in several states totaling approximately $20,211, which are available to offset future taxable income and expire between 2009 and 2015. The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these state loss carryforwards. The Company also has foreign loss carryforwards in sixteen countries as of December 31, 2002, of approximately $104,552, which are available to offset future taxable income, and have carryforward periods ranging from five years to unlimited.  The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to these foreign loss carryforwards.  Based on analysis of current information, which indicated that it is not likely that some of these state and  foreign losses will be realized, a valuation allowance has been established for a portion of these loss carryforwards.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains a qualified noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan covering the majority of its domestic employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five years compensation during the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. The plan assets are under a single custodian and a single investment manager. Plan assets are invested in equities, government securities and bonds. In addition, the Company has unfunded supplemental executive pension plans providing additional benefits to certain employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an unfunded postretirement medical and nominal life insurance plan ("postretirement benefits") covering certain domestic employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993. The plan has not been extended to any additional employees. Retired employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993 are required to contribute for coverage as if they were active employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postretirement transition obligation as of January 1, 1993 of $1,079 is being amortized over twenty years. The discount rate used in determining the 2002, 2001 and 2000 expense was 6.75%, 7.50% and 7.75%, respectively. The health care cost trend rate was 9.0% declining to 5.0% over a ten year period, remaining level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the reported amounts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, A.L. Industrier purchased a convertible subordinated note issued by the Company in the amount of $67,850. In October 2001 the Company exchanged the convertible subordinate note into 2,372,897 shares of Class B common stock. (See Note 13.) In addition, as of December 31, 2002 there was a net current receivable of $106 from A.L. Industrier and as of December 31, 2001 there was a net current receivable of $290 to A.L. Industrier.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  This class action has been brought on behalf of all persons who acquired the Company's securities between April 28, 1999 and October 30, 2000.  The Company is named as a defendant along with two of its board members, one of whom is an officer, and two of its former officers.  The class action complaint alleges that, among other things, the plaintiffs were damaged when they acquired the Company's securities because, as a result of (1) alleged irregularities in the Company's Animal Health business in Brazil, (2) allegedly improper revenue recognition practices and (3) the October 2000 revision of its financial results for 1999 and 2000, the Company's previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company's securities.  The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securi
ties and Exchange Act of 1934.  The plaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts.  The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on legal grounds and the District Court granted its motion with prejudice as to all defendants.  The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court and the District Court affirmed its earlier dismissal.  The plaintiffs have appealed the Court's decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  The Company intends to vigorously defend this appeal.  Additionally, the Company has filed a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the named individual defendants under its directors' and officers' insurance policies and believes that insurance coverage exists to the extent of the policy limits for the costs incurred in defending the claims and any adverse judgment or settlement, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the relevant insurance policy.  Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the clas
s action will result in liability which will be material to the Company's financial position.  However, it is not possible for the Company to conclude definitively that resolution of the lawsuit will not be material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or year in which it occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Union Court of First Instance has upheld the European Union's (the "EU") ban on bacitracin zinc, one of the Company's feed additive products which was banned from sale in the EU effective July 1, 1999.  The Company has not sold bacitracin zinc in the EU since 1999, therefore the court action will have no material financial impact on the Company. The Company has not sold bacitracin zinc in the EU since 1999, therefore the court action will have no material financial impact on the Company.  The Company cannot predict whether the present bacitracin zinc ban will be expanded.  If either (a) the EU or countries or customers within the EU, act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based products, or (b) there is an expansion of the ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products or (c) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of anti
biotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  The Company also cannot predict whether this antibiotic resistance concern will result in expanded regulations adversely affecting other antibiotic-based animal health products manufactured by the Company of which it has significant sales.  The discussions concerning resistance to antibiotics used in certain food producing animals have recently become more active in the U.S.  Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse effects of the use of antibiotics in food animals.  Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company's customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics.   The FDA has proposed scientific based guidance on antibiotics which includes recommendations which could prohibit the introduction of certain new products containing antibiotics.  In addition, the FDA
 has indicated that it intends to re-evaluate certain currently approved products.  The Company believes that the impact of such evaluation on the Company's current products will be limited.  However, the loss of the U.S. market for the Company's  products containing antibiotics, would be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Company's submission to the FDA of its ANDAs filed under paragraph IV for gabapentin capsules and tablets, the Company was sued on June 11, 1998 with respect to capsules and on December 12, 1999 with respect to tablets, by Warner-Lambert Company, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement under two U.S. patents.  The ANDAs submitted seek FDA approval to market the Company's gabapentin capsules and tablets prior to the expiration of Pfizer's patents.  In the Company's ANDAs, the Company certified to Pfizer and the FDA that its proposed generic gabapentin capsules and tablets will not infringe the patents and that the patents are believed to be invalid or unenforceable.  In the litigation concerning the Company's gabapentin capsules, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the two patents, which was subsequently denied.  The Company filed in the table
t litigation, and renewed in the capsule litigation, the Company's motion of summary judgment of non-infringement on Pfizer's patents.  These motions are under consideration by the District Court.  Discovery is complete and the case is awaiting trial. &nbsp;During the lawsuits regarding gabapentin tablets and capsules, Pfizer received a third patent covering a gabapentin formulation with low chloride levels.  After learning of this patent, the Company certified to the FDA under paragraph IV that the Company's proposed gabapentin capsule and tablet, as disclosed in its previously filed ANDAs, do not infringe this patent and this patent is invalid or unenforceable.  In June 2000, Pfizer sued the Company in the District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement under this patent.  The Company submitted to the court a motion for summary judgment that neither the capsule nor tablet product infringes this patent.  This motion is under consideration by the Court and has not yet been ruled on.  Di
scovery has closed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three gabapentin cases have been consolidated for trial.  While no trial date has been set, a pre-trial conference is expected by the end of March 2003 at which time a date for trial is expected to be set.  Unless and until the Company receives FDA authorization and decides to utilize such authorization to market its gabapentin tablets or capsules, the Company would, in the event of an adverse decision, at most, only be liable to Pfizer for its legal costs and not any monetary damages.  To date, the Company has not marketed these pharmaceuticals.  There is the possibility that as a result of this litigation, the Company could be prevented from marketing the Company's gabapentin capsules or tablets until Pfizer's patents expire. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Company be permitted to market gabapentin prior to the expiration of the Pfizer patents, it expects to apply to the FDA for access to the 180 day period of generic marketing exclusivity, which is generally awarded to the generic competitor who is first in time to file a paragraph IV certification against the relevant patents of the innovator.  In August 2002, the Company sued the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to clarify its rights to exclusivity and for a ruling that it properly submitted a statement of inapplicable use to one of the Orange Book listed patents.  In December 2002, the court ruled that Purepac's statement of inapplicable use was appropriate.  The court deferred to the FDA to decide the impact of the court's ruling on the subject of exclusivity.  On January 28, 2003, the Company received confirmation from the FDA that it has secured eligibility for 180 day market exclusivity on gabapentin 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules. 
 Exclusivity for this product will be triggered by the earlier of either Purepac's commercial marketing of gabapentin or a court decision that finds the relevant Pfizer patent invalid or not infringed.  While the FDA ruling does not address the tablet form of gabapentin, the Company expects the FDA position on market exclusivity for the 600 mg and 800 mg gabapentin tablets to be consistent with its position on capsules.  The FDA's ruling is a significant positive event for the Company.  A court action would be required to overrule the FDA's decision and for the Company to lose its eligibility for 180 day market exclusivity.  On February 14, 2003, Torpharm, a competitor with an ANDA for gabapentin capsules, filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking final approval for its gabapentin capsules ANDA.  If Torpharm is successful, the Company could lose its rights to the 180 day exclusivity period.  The Company has intervened in the lawsuit seeking to maintain it
s right to exclusivity.  No trial date has yet been set and the Company cannot predict when the court will issue a decision.  The Company can give no assurance that it will ultimately benefit from an exclusivity period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the launch of gabapentin, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (the "API") of gabapentin under which the Company has acquired API inventory.  The terms of the Company's agreement with the API supplier will require the payment to the supplier of a portion of the Company's net sales of finished dose gabapentin product during any period of exclusivity ("Net Sales Split").  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had paid $4,422 in partial payment of inventory on hand.  The Company will make an additional payment of $4,422 for on hand inventory in 2003 and a third payment of $8,225 in 2004.  A further payment of $8,225 will be due only upon final FDA approval of the Company's marketing authorization for gabapentin.  All of these payments reduce the Net Sales Split on a dollar for dollar basis.  The Company cannot predict the outcome of the gabapentin litigation; however, in the event of an unfavorab
le outcome, or other factors preventing the Company from selling the finished product, the Company will reassess the net realizable value of the API inventory, and may incur a charge to write-down API inventory on hand to its net realizable value and record any required payments under the supply agreement.  The maximum charge could be approximately $25,000 based on inventory currently on hand. The Company has no present obligation to purchase additional API inventory. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers and customers regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products.  Given the fact that these disputes will most probably be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, the SEC notified the Company that it had commenced a formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the 2000 and 2001 restatements of its financial statements.  While deposition discovery is underway, the proceeding is in its early stages.  The SEC has stated that the commencement of this investigation is not an indication that the SEC presently believes that a violation of any applicable laws has occurred.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001 and 2003, the Company received inspection observations ("483 Reports") from the FDA at its USHP facilities in Baltimore and Elizabeth, respectively.  The 483 Reports listed alleged deviations from, primarily, cGMPs. The 2001 inspection at Baltimore resulted in an allegation by the FDA that the Company was not in compliance with a 1992 Consent Decree requiring general compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices.  In July 2002, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection to the 2001 inspection of the Baltimore facility and in August 2002 issued a re-inspection report.  In response to the 2002 FDA report, the Company submitted a comprehensive  corrective action plan to the FDA in October of 2002.  The FDA has not formally commented on the Company's corrective action plan.  The Company expects the FDA to respond to its proposed plan in 2003.  The Company has begun upgrading plant procedures at the Baltimore plant in accordance with the plan and has provided written
 monthly updates to the FDA.  The plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by mid-2004.  The estimated total cost of the Baltimore corrective actions is approximately $30,000.  As part of the corrective action plan, product recalls were conducted in 2002 and production at the Baltimore facility reduced.  This reduction in production has had an effect on earnings in 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between November, 2002 and January, 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Company's Elizabeth plant.  As a result of the inspection, the Company received a 483 Report from the FDA on January 15, 2003.  The Company submitted a comprehensive response on February 5, 2003 and is currently taking actions to address the observations made by the FDA, in accordance with the response.  The Company anticipates completion of these actions during or before February 2004.  Certain product recalls were included in the corrective action plan which were recorded in 2002.  The corrective action plan contemplates continued output at 2002 levels.  The estimated total cost of the Elizabeth corrective actions is approximately $8,000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost and timing of both the Baltimore and Elizabeth corrective action plans may change based upon the FDA response which has not yet been received and other factors.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counterparties to derivative agreements are major financial institutions. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also used interest rate swaps to hedge variable interest rates, in accordance with the requirements of the 2001 Credit Facility. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with offsetting amounts, included in Other Comprehensive Loss on an after-tax basis in the amount of $3,267.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the derivative fair value that are designated as effective and qualify in cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedge transactions occur and are then recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2002, the Company uses hedged transactions covered under FAS 133 exclusively to manage risk under variable interest rate debt. The Company has structured all existing interest rate swap agreements as 100% effective. As a result, there is no current impact to earnings resulting for hedge ineffectiveness. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently has the following interest rate swaps, classified as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2002:</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt other than the subordinated notes approximates fair value because a significant portion of the underlying debt is at variable rates and reprices frequently. The fair value of the 2005 and 2006 subordinated notes is based on the bid price of the notes, which are publicly traded.  The fair value of the 2009 subordinated notes, which are not publicly traded, has been calculated based on comparable market yields at December 31, 2002. The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was as follows:</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Company's 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan"), the Company may grant options to key employees to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock. The maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Plan is 8,000,000. In addition, the Company has a Non-Employee Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan") which provides for the issue of up to 350,000 shares of Class A Common stock. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Options granted expire from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options are exercisable in installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. The Plan permits a cash appreciation right to be granted to certain employees. Included in options outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2002 are options to purchase 27,550 shares with cash appreciation rights, 9,325 of whi
ch are exercisable. If an option holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which are not vested at the date of termination are forfeited. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, options for 1,768,423 and 1,775,038 shares, respectively, were available for future grant.</P>

<P>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Information Concerning Business Segments and Geographic Operations:</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the Company adopted SFAS 131. The Company's reportable segments are the four businesses described in Note 1, (i.e. IG, API, USHP, AH). Each business operates in a distinct business and/or geographic area.  In September 2001, the Company announced the creation of Human Pharmaceuticals International ("HPI") to be composed of IG, API and the Chinese operations of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals.  In October 2001, the Company announced the creation of U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP") to be composed of USPD and the U.S. operations of Faulding Oral Pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of each segment are evaluated based on earnings before interest and taxes (operating income). Corporate expenses and certain other expenses or income not directly attributable to the segments are not allocated. Eliminations include intersegment sales. Geographic revenues represent sales to third parties by country in which the selling legal entity is domiciled. Operating assets directly attributable to business segments are included in identifiable assets (i.e. sum of accounts receivable, inventories, net property, plant and equipment and net intangible assets). Cash, prepaid expenses, and other corporate and non-allocated assets are included in unallocated. For geographic reporting long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment and net intangibles.  Segment data includes immaterial intersegment revenues. No customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B>ALPHARMA INC.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<U>EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>1.&#9;<U>History of The Plan</U>.  This plan was originally adopted by A.L. Laboratories, Inc. on September 7, 1990 as the A.L. Laboratories, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan with an effective date of October&nbsp;1, 1990.  The Plan was subsequently amended from time to time and amended and restated in its entirety, effective as of October 1, 2002 as the Alpharma Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan is maintained by Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") and any of its domestic or international subsidiaries that may adopt the Plan from time to time (each such adopting subsidiary referred to herein as a "Covered Entity") with the Company's consent.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>2.&#9;<U>Purpose</U>.  The purpose of the Plan is to give employees wishing to do so a convenient means of purchasing shares of Alpharma Inc. Class A Common Stock (the "Shares") through after-tax payroll deductions, supplemented by contributions made by the Company or a Covered Entity.  The Company believes that ownership of Shares by employees will foster greater employee interest in the Company's growth and development.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>3.&#9;<U>Effective Date</U>.  The "effective date" of this amendment and restatement of the Plan is October 1, 2002.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>4.&#9;<U>Plan Administration</U>.  The Plan shall be administered by a committee appointed for such purpose by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Benefit Plans Administrative Committee").  As Plan administrator, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall have complete control of the administration of the Plan, which includes the determination of employees' eligibility for participation in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 5 hereof, the interpretation of provisions of the Plan, the adoption of any rules or regulations which may be necessary, advisable or desirable in the operation of the Plan, including restrictions on the sale by employees of Shares purchased under the Plan, and the delegation of certain of the duties of the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee to an agent to facilitate the purchase and transfer of Shares and to otherwise assist in the administration of the Plan.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall control the 
general administration of the Plan with all powers necessary to enable it to carry out its duties in that respect, except that, if for any reason a Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall not have been appointed or shall cease to exist or function, all authority and duties of the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee under this Plan shall be vested in and exercised by the Board of Directors of the Company.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>5.&#9;<U>Eligibility</U>.  Any employee of the Company or a Covered Entity shall be eligible to participate in the Plan on the January&nbsp;1, April 1, July&nbsp;1 or October 1 (or at special entry dates approved by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee) coinciding with or next following the completion of three months of employment (the "Plan Entry Date") provided such employee (i)&nbsp;regularly works at least 9 months during the calendar year (or the Company anticipates as of the Plan Entry Date that the employee shall work at least 9 months during the calendar year), (ii) has an average work week of 20 hours or more during the period worked, (iii) has attained age 18, (iv)&nbsp;does not, and shall not by reason of participating in the Plan, own stock in the Company possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or the value of all classes of stock of the Company or its subsidiary corporations, and (v) is not an employee of a domestic or international s
ubsidiary of the Company which is (a) prohibited by law from participating in the Plan, or (b) in the discretion of the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee, precluded from participating in the Plan by government regulation or other action ("Eligible Employees").  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall determine which employees are eligible to participate in the Plan in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>6.&#9;<U>Participation</U>.  Participation in the Plan is entirely voluntary.  An Eligible Employee may become a participant at a Plan Entry Date by submitting an election to participate on a form supplied by the Company and submitting such form to the Company at least 30 days prior to the Plan Entry Date (or otherwise in accordance with administrative procedures approved by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee) on which that Eligible Employee would like to begin participation. </P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>7.&#9;<U>Payroll Deductions and Other Contributions</U>.  A participant may authorize payroll deductions under the Plan, in an amount equal to one to four percent (in whole percentages) of a participant's compensation paid by the Company or other Covered Entity during the Plan Quarter.  For this purpose, "compensation" means the basic earnings paid to the participant excluding overtime pay, bonuses and commissions and any other incentive pay.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, a participant's compensation paid by the Company or Covered Entities shall include any salary reduction amounts elected by the participant and credited to a qualified or nonqualified deferred compensation program during the Plan Year notwithstanding the fact that amounts deferred under such programs are not reflected on the participant's federal withholding tax statement, Form W-2 (or other comparable wage statement designated by the Company).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Payroll deductions can be changed as of the beginning of any calendar quarter only by giving written notice to the Company adequately in advance of the beginning of such calendar quarter.  Reductions in payroll deductions to zero may be changed effective as of the next payroll date,  by giving written notice to the Company adequately in advance of such payroll date.   The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee may prospectively impose restrictions on participants who reduce their payroll deductions to zero.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>8.&#9;<U>Contributions by the Company</U>.  The Company or the Covered Entity by whom a participant is employed on the last day of a calendar quarter will make contributions to the Plan in an amount equal to 50% of the total amount of participant contributions paid to the Plan during such quarter.  Such contributions, whether made by the Company or a Covered Entity, as appropriate, are sometimes referred to herein as "Company Contributions." Neither the Company nor the Covered Entity shall be required to make any contributions for a participant for the Plan Quarter in which such participant's employment terminates.  The Company or the Covered Entity may elect to make such additional contributions into the Plan in excess of the 50% contribution as it, in the exercise of its sole discretion, deems appropriate.  These additional contributions to the Plan by the Company or the Covered Entity in excess of 50% ("Company Voluntary Contributions"), if any, shall be made on an a
d hoc basis and may vary based upon the discretion of the management of the employing entity with the consent of the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall distribute Company Voluntary Contributions among participants in any manner the Company desires, and the Company or Covered Entity may direct that such Company Voluntary Contributions be distributed in a manner other than in proportion to the participants' own contributions to the Plan.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>9.&#9;<U>The Plan Year</U>.  The Plan shall operate on a fiscal year beginning on the first day of January in each year and ending on the 31st day of December.  This fiscal year is referred to herein as the "Plan Year."</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>10.&#9;<U>Plan Quarters</U>.  The Plan Year shall be divided into four Plan quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.  Each such quarter is referred to herein as a "Plan Quarter."</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>11.&#9;<U>Allocation of Participant and Company Contributions</U>.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will establish a "cash account" and a "Share account" for each participant under the Plan for bookkeeping purposes.  As soon as practicable on or after the last day of each Plan Quarter, but in no case later than the fifteenth day of the month immediately following the end of the Plan Quarter, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will credit each participant's cash account with such participant's payroll deductions during the Plan Quarter ("Credited Payroll Deductions"), and will pay and allocate the Company Contributions applicable to such participant.  The date of crediting of such Credited Payroll Deductions and Company Contributions is referred to herein as the "Deduction Crediting Date".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will allocate Company Contributions to each participant's cash account in an amount equal to 50% of each participant's Credited Payroll Deductions; provided, however, that Company Voluntary Contributions may be allocated among participants' accounts in any manner the Company may choose.  The Company shall not be required to pay or accrue interest on payroll deductions, the cash balances in participants' cash accounts or on the value of participants' Share accounts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Benefits or rights which any person may expect to receive (contingently or otherwise) under the Plan may not be assigned or pledged.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>12.&#9;<U>Share Purchases</U>.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall determine before the end of each Plan Quarter the number of Shares to be purchased for the benefit of participants, and whether such Shares shall be purchased on the open market, by private purchase or from the Company.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall then promptly notify its agent, if any, of this determination.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will use the entire balance of funds in participants' cash accounts to purchase the Shares to be allocated to participants' accounts within the first 15 working days following the end of each Plan Quarter.  Shares to be purchased from the Company pursuant to the Plan shall be made available from currently or subsequently authorized and unissued Shares or Shares authorized, issued and owned now or hereafter by the Company.  In the event of a purchase by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent) on the open
 market, the cost per Share to participants will be determined by the actual average price per Share paid for the Shares by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent).  In the event of a private purchase or purchases by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent), the cost per Share to participants shall be equal to the average closing market price on the New York Stock Exchange per Share on the dates such Shares were actually purchased.  In the event of a purchase from the Company by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent), the cost per Share to participants shall be equal to the average closing market price on the New York Stock Exchange per Share during such Plan Quarter.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>13.&#9;<U>Allocation of Shares</U>.  As soon as practicable after all necessary Shares have been purchased by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent) for the benefit of participants, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will allocate such Shares to participants' Share accounts (the date of such allocation to be referred to as the "Share Allocation Date") in the following manner:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The Company will determine the average cost per Share to participants of all Shares purchased;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Company will then allocate whole Shares and fractional Shares to the Share accounts of the individual participants to the extent of the balances in their respective cash accounts.  The cash accounts will be charged with the cost to participants of all Shares so allocated.  No cash balances will remain in the participants' cash accounts immediately after each Share Allocation Date;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;Until certificates are issued, no person shall have any right to sell, assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any of the Shares allocated to a participant's Share account, except as permitted under Section 14 by satisfying the specific administrative procedures directing the Share Administrative Agent to sell Shares directly from the participant's Share account.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>14.&#9;<U>Issuance, Transfer or Sale of Share Certificates</U>.  Share certificates for the number of whole Shares in each participant's Share account may be issued to such participant or his brokerage account in paper form or electronically.  Share certificates shall be issued only upon receipt by the Share Administrative Agent, (who shall be selected from time to time in the discretion of the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee), of a participant's request indicating the number of Shares (up to a maximum of the number of whole Shares in the participant's Share account) for which the participant wishes to receive certificates.  Such request shall be made on a form or in such other manner as prescribed by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee.  Share certificates shall be issued to the participant or his brokerage account as soon as practicable after such request is properly made.  If a participant requests the withdrawal of all whole Shares in his account, the 
whole number of Shares will be distributed to him in the form of Share certificates and, if requested, the remaining fractional Shares will be distributed to him in cash.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A participant may sell any or all of his Shares by providing a request (made in accordance with administrative procedures adopted by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee) to the Share Administrative Agent.  The participant's Shares will be sold as soon as administratively practicable after such request is received by the Share Administrative Agent and the participant will receive the net proceeds of the sale of the Shares in the form of a local currency check (currently for a fee of US $15.00) or a wire transfer (for non-US participants only and currently for a fee of US $25.00) shortly thereafter.  As of October&nbsp;1, 2002, net proceeds equals the gross proceeds from the actual sale of Shares less a processing fee of US $17.00 and a commission of 12 cents ($0.12) per Share sold -- the term "net proceeds" is subject to modification by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee, in its sole discretion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee, in its discretion, may impose additional restrictions on the issuance, transfer or sale of Shares, provided that (i)&nbsp;participants are provided with notice in advance of the effective date of any such restrictions, (ii)&nbsp;such restrictions would only apply to Shares which participants purchase after the effective date of such restrictions and (iii)&nbsp;such restrictions are administered in a nondiscriminatory and uniform manner.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A participant may elect in writing or in such other manner as prescribed by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee on a form prescribed by and filed with the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent) to have such Share certificates issued to both such participant and a designated individual, in joint tenancy with right of survivorship or in tenancy in common.  A joint ownership election will be effective with respect to the date that such Share certificates are issued.  Such joint ownership election will remain in effect for Share certificates issued to such participant on or before the earlier to occur of (i) the participant's death or (ii) the date which is 31 days after the participant files a proper written revocation of such election with the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent).  A participant who revokes a joint ownership election may not make another joint ownership election during the 12 month period following the date the written revocation was re
ceived by the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section or any other provisions contained in this Plan, no Share certificates will be issued, transferred or sold on behalf of any participant who is an "Officer" of the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 16a-l(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, until six months after such Shares have been purchased for the account of the participant.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>15.&#9;<U>Expenses</U>.  The Company or the Covered Entity will bear the costs associated with administering the Plan and purchasing Shares, including any brokers' fees, commissions, postage or transfer taxes.  No expenses attributable to a participant's sale or transfer of Shares, however, will be borne by the Company or the Covered Entity.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>16.&#9;<U>Cash Dividends and Share Distributions</U>.</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>a.&#9;<U>Cash Dividends</U>.  Cash dividends attributable to Shares allocated to participants' Share accounts as of the record date for which such cash dividends are declared will be credited to participants' Share accounts as of the dividend payment date and applied to Share purchases and allocations on such date in accordance with the methods set forth in Sections 12 and 13 hereof. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>b.&#9;<U>Share Distributions and Share Splits</U>.  Share distributions and Share splits attributable to Shares allocated to participants' Share accounts as of the Share distribution record date or the Share split effective date will be credited directly to participants' Share accounts as of the record date and the effective date, respectively, of such Share distributions and such Share splits.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>c.&#9;<U>Share Rights and Warrants</U>.  The Company may, from time to time, in the exercise of its sole discretion, declare Share rights or warrants with respect to Shares.  Following and as of the record date for determining those shareholders of record entitled to receive Share rights or warrants with respect to their Shares, the Company shall issue, and the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall allocate, such Share rights and/or warrants directly to the appropriate participants as though the Shares allocated to the account of each such participant were held of record by such participant.  Certificates representing such Share rights or warrants, if any such certificates have been authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, may be issued to participants pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 14 of this Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d.&#9;<U>Changes in Common Stock</U>.  In the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, merger, consolidation or other event causing an increase or change in the Shares, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall take appropriate changes in the number and type of Shares that at the time of such event remain available for purchase under the Plan.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>17.&#9;<U>Voting Rights</U>.  Holders of Shares have the right to vote on matters affecting the Company.  If one of these matters is submitted to the stockholders for a vote, then following the record date for any stockholder meeting at which such vote is to occur, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall advise the Company of the number of participants for whom Shares are held in Share accounts on such record date, and the Company shall furnish the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee (or its agent) with sufficient sets of its proxy soliciting materials to deliver one set to each such participant.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall thereupon forward one set to each participant for whom allocated Shares are being held and request voting instructions.  Upon receipt of voting instructions, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall vote the Shares as instructed.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall not vote any Share allocated t
o a participant's Share account unless voting instructions have been received from the participant.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>18.&#9;<U>Records and Reports to Participants</U>.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall cause to be maintained true and accurate books of account, and a record of all transactions under the Plan, and such accounts, books and records relating thereto shall be open to inspection and audit by such person or persons designated by the Company.  At least annually, but in all cases on or before March 31 of each year, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall file with the Treasurer of the Company a written report setting forth all receipts and disbursements and other transactions effected on behalf of the Plan during the last preceding Plan Year, including a description of all Shares purchased together with the cost of all such Shares.  Such report shall also disclose any liabilities of the Plan and shall show, as of the close of the Plan Year, the value of each active cash account and Share account of each participant together with the record of Share cert
ificates delivered to each of the participants during such Plan Year.  The Benefit Plans Administrative Committee shall have the right to maintain one or more bank accounts for funds contributed to the Plan, and to make deposits in and withdrawals therefrom in connection with its administration of the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An annual report shall be rendered to each participant in the Plan annually within 90 days after the close of the Plan Year, showing for the Plan Year just ended:</P><DIR>

Settlement of the accounts of participants whose employment has terminated shall be made as soon as possible following the date on which termination of employment occurred.  As promptly as practicable after the date on which termination of employment occurred, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will deliver to such former participant (or such former participant's brokerage account, if elected by such participant on a timely basis) a certificate for the number of whole Shares allocated to such participant's Share account and not previously distributed, together with a check for (i) any remaining cash balance and (ii) the value of any fractional Shares allocated to such participant's Share account.  Alternatively, the terminated participant may elect on a timely basis to have the Share Administrative Agent sell the Shares in order to receive the net proceeds in lieu of the Shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of a participant's death, settlement will be made to the participant's designated beneficiary, if any.  If no beneficiary has been designated, or if such beneficiary does not survive the participant, settlement will be made to the participant's duly appointed legal representative after the satisfaction of any applicable legal requirements.  If a participant has been married for at least one year at the time of his death, his spouse must consent (or have consented) in writing for any nonspousal beneficiary designation to be effective.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of termination of the Plan, the Benefit Plans Administrative Committee will make an allocation of Shares to the Share accounts of the participants in the usual manner.
