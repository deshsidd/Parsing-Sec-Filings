     executive officers of the Company were out-of-the money.
    

(d)  Employment and Other Agreements

     The Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Brady,
effective as of September 19, 1994.  The agreement with Mr. Brady provides that
he will serve as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company
until September 19, 1996, at which time the employment term will be
automatically extended for successive one-year periods unless either party
notifies the other that the term will not be extended at least one year prior
to the termination date.  The agreement is currently in a renewal period.  The
agreement provides that Mr. Brady will receive compensation in the form of (a)
a minimum annual base salary of $350,000 and (b) incentive compensation in
amounts determined in accordance with the Company's Executive Incentive
Compensation Plan (provided that Mr. Brady's incentive compensation was not
less than $200,000 for the Company's fiscal year ended July 31, 1995).
Pursuant to the agreement and the Company's 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan, Mr.
Brady has received (a) non-qualified stock options to purchase 140,000 shares
of Common Stock (vesting generally 25% on each of the first four anniversaries
of the date of grant) at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on
the date of grant (i.e., $12.125 per share) and (b) a bonus stock award for
10,000 shares of Common Stock.  The employment agreement also provides that Mr.
Brady is entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans and to receive
all fringe benefits as are from time to time made generally available to senior
management of the Company.  Mr. Brady also received a $100,000 execution bonus.

<PAGE>   7



   
     The Company may terminate Mr. Brady's employment in the event of Mr.
Brady's incapacity or serious misconduct (as those terms are defined in the
employment agreement) or as a result of a substantial failure or inability by
Mr. Brady to perform his duties (after a cure period) or the breach of certain
noncompetition or confidentiality obligations set forth in the employment
agreement.  The Company may also terminate the employment agreement at any
time, provided that in such case or in the event the Company delivers notice of
its determination not to extend the term of the agreement, Mr. Brady will be
entitled to receive a severance benefit of 24 months of his base salary then in
effect (in addition to other benefits generally available to senior management
employed by the company), such 24 month period to be reduced (but not by more
than 12 months) by the number of months Mr. Brady is employed pursuant to the
employment agreement beyond September 19, 1996. The severance benefits provided
for in Mr. Brady's employment agreement will not be payable in the event of a
pay-out under Mr. Brady's Change-in-Control Agreement described below. The 
agreement also contains certain non-competition and confidentiality 
obligations of Mr. Brady.
    


Change-In-Control Agreements

   
     In July 1995 the Board authorized the Company to enter into agreements
with each of  Jerome D. Brady, President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas D.
Rooney, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,  and Steven R. Andrews,
Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, to secure their continued
service in the event of any "Change-in-Control (collectively, the
"Change-in-Control Agreements").  The Change-in-Control Agreements provide, in
the event of  a "Change-in-Control," that such officers will receive a
"Retention Bonus" ($800,000 for Mr. Brady, $250,000 for Mr. Rooney and $200,000
for Mr. Andrews).  Under the Change-in-Control Agreements,  a
"Change-in-Control" occurred on August 27, 1996 when the sale of substantially
all of the Company's Sheridan Systems assets was consummated.  Accordingly, the
Retention Bonus will be paid in accordance with the provisions of an escrow
agreement on the earliest to occur of (1) the date of the consummation of the
merger (the "Merger") contemplated by the Merger Purchase Agreement dated as of
October 29, 1996 with a corporation newly formed by affiliates of Pacholder
Associates, Inc. (if the officer is employed by the Company on such date), (2)
February 27, 1997 (if the officer is employed by the Company on such date), and
(3) the date on which the officer's employment by the Company terminates by
reason of a "Qualifying Termination" or his death or disability.  A "Qualifying
Termination" means a termination by the Company for a reason other than "cause"
or by the officer for "good reason" each as defined in the agreements.  A
"Qualifying Termination" also includes a termination of employment by the
officer for any reason whatsoever during the 30-day period commencing on August
27, 1997.  The definition of "good reason" provides that in the event a
Change-in-Control which results from the sale of Sheridan Systems, "good
reason" shall be deemed to exist on or after the date on which the Retention
Bonus becomes payable to the officer.  In addition, if after a
Change-in-Control there is a Qualifying Termination, the officer will receive a
lump sum cash amount equal to two times the officer's highest rate of annual
base salary in effect at any time after the date of the execution of the
Change- in-Control Agreement (which amount is reduced over time following the
Change-in-Control), together with a pro rata portion of bonus for the year and
payments of certain accrued benefits.   Such lump sum cash payments as of 
November 1, 1996 are currently estimated to be $700,000 for Mr. Brady, $399,000
for Mr. Rooney and $397,000 for Mr. Andrews. Pursuant to a Change-in-Control
Agreement with Ulrik T. Nygaard, the Company has paid $100,000 to Mr. Nygaard
in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under such agreement.
    

     On October 29, 1996, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Mr.
Rooney and executed acknowledgment letters in favor of Messrs. Brady and
Andrews.  The letters from the Company to Messrs. Brady and Andrews advised
them that their employment would be terminated as of the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") and acknowledged that such termination of employment would be
treated as a Qualifying Termination under their Change-in-Control Agreements.
The letter agreement between the Company and Mr. Rooney effects a satisfaction
and discharge of the parties' respective obligations under Mr. Rooney's
Change-in-Control Agreement.  Under the terms of Mr. Rooney's letter agreement,
Mr. Rooney will receive the cash payments from the Company he otherwise would
have received had there been a Qualifying Termination at the Closing.

Other Agreements

   
     Certain executive officers of the Company have entered into agreements
regarding supplemental retirement benefits ("SRP").  These agreements generally
provide, subject to certain exceptions, that upon normal retirement at age 65,
such persons are entitled to receive a fixed monthly cash payment for life of 3
1/3% of their final average monthly compensation times their years of service
(up to a maximum of 15 years), provided, however, that such supplemental
benefits be reduced by the actuarial value of all other retirement benefits
payable to such person from all the Company's other sponsored retirement
programs.  The estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement at normal
retirement age for each of the Named Executive Officers entitled to receive
these benefits are $429,066  for Mr. Brady, $241,410 for Mr. Rooney and
$157,974 for Mr. Andrews.  All of the foregoing supplemental benefits are
unfunded and as of July 31, 1996, the Company has reserved approximately
$1,272,699 with respect to such benefits which have accrued.  In the event of
the closing of the Merger, in lieu of the foregoing, there will be lump-sum
payments in the amount of $252,322 for Mr. Brady, $727,119 for Mr. Rooney and
$76,266 for Mr. Andrews.
    


DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Directors are reimbursed for travel and expenses related to attendance at
meetings of the Board of Directors or Board committees.  Directors who are
non-employees of the Company receive a quarterly retainer of $5,000 and a
meeting fee of $750 for attendance in other than regular meetings in person or
by telephone.  Directors who are officers of the Company receive no additional
compensation for their services as directors.

     On August 27, 1987 the Board of Directors approved a retirement plan for
outside directors with a minimum of five years of service.  Under the plan,
eligible directors commence receiving benefits upon the later of attainment of
age 65 and the actual date of retirement.  The benefit payable under the plan
is 75% of the annual retainer in effect at the time of retirement, payable in
equal annual installments.  The number of annual installments is equal to the
number of years of service, with payments made on the August 1st following the
director's retirement.  In 1988, the retirement plan was amended to provide
that all outside directors become eligible immediately upon a change in control
of the Company.  The plan also provides for mandatory retirement upon
attainment of age 70, except for all persons over the age of 65 serving as
directors at the time of adoption of the plan.  Upon the effective date of the
Company's Plan of Reorganization, the retirement plan for outside directors was
assumed as an executory contract and in August, 1995 the second installment of
payments was paid to five directors in the aggregate amount of $79,500.  Annual
payments are expected to continue to certain directors through the year 2009.

     Pursuant to the terms of the Company's 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan,
non-employee directors are automatically granted, on the date of each annual
meeting of stockholders, non-qualified options to purchase 1,000 shares of
Common Stock at an option exercise price per share equal to the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant.  Such options are
exercisable in part or in full on the date of grant and expire ten years after
the date of grant.  If a non-employee director ceases to be a director of the
Company for any reason, each option held by such holder is exercisable for a
period of three months after the date of such holder's ceasing to be a director
or until the expiration of the term of such option, whichever is shorter.

     The Company is not aware of any family relationship between any director
or person nominated or chosen by the Board to become a director or an executive
officer of the Company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates.
