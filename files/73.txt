&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Alpharma is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals. The Company markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products that are manufactured by third-parties, an extended release morphine sulfate pain medication sold under the trademark KADIAN, in the U.S. and a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product sold in the U.S., beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. The Company manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients and one chemically synthesized active pharmaceutical ingredient (collectively "APIs") that are used primarily by third parties in the manufacture of finished dose products. The Company manufactures and markets animal health products, consisting primarily of medicated feed additives ("MFAs") and water soluble therapeutics for production animals, principally poultry, cattle and swine. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company presently conducts business in more than 80 countries and has approximately 2,000 employees in over 20 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported revenues of approximately $722.4 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 6, 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients business to certain investment funds managed by 3i, a global private equity and venture capital company. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2008, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.&nbsp; </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Formation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is incorporated in Delaware. The Company was originally organized as A.L. Laboratories, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S., a Norwegian healthcare company (the predecessor company to A.L. Industrier ASA; formerly Alpharma's controlling stockholder). In 1994, the Company acquired the complementary human pharmaceutical and animal health business of its parent company and subsequently changed its name to Alpharma Inc. to operate worldwide as one corporate entity<B>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Repurchase of Class B Shares; Elimination of Controlling Stockholder</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until December 28, 2006, A.L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier") beneficially owned all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock, or approximately 22% of the Company's total common stock as of such date. Through its ownership of the Class B common stock, Industrier had voting power that provided it with effective control of the Company. On December 28, 2006, two of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries purchased 100% (11,872,897 shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from Industrier at a price of $25.50 per share. Including related fees, the cost of the repurchase was approximately $307.4 million, which was paid using available cash on hand. Following the Class B share repurchase, control of the Company now rests in the holders of the Class A shares acting by the majority applicable under Delaware law and the Company's charter documents. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discontinued Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 19, 2005, the Company sold its worldwide human generics pharmaceutical business (the "Generics Business"), excluding ParMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("ParMed"), its generics pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution unit, to Actavis Group hf ("Actavis") for cash in the amount of $810 million. The form of this transaction included the sale of all of the Company's subsidiaries that were, as of the closing of the transaction, engaged solely in the Generics Business and a transfer of the assets and liabilities related to the Generics Business from those subsidiaries of the Company that, as of the closing of the transaction, engaged in both the Generics Business and other businesses of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Generics Business transaction, substantially all of the material liabilities (including without limitation, claims, lawsuits and other contingent liabilities) of the Generics Business were transferred to Actavis or entities owned by Actavis. The Company made certain representations and warranties to Actavis regarding the Generics Business as a part of the transaction, and subject to certain limitations, agreed to indemnify Actavis to the extent that such representations and warranties were incorrect. In addition, the Company retained liability for certain specified liabilities which the Company believes are not, in the aggregate, material to the Company and may be held responsible for certain liabilities of the Generics Business transferred to Actavis in the event that Actavis fails to or is unable to satisfy such liabilities. The financial statements contained in this 10-K Report present the Generics Business as a discontinued operation. </
P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On March 31, 2006, the Company sold ParMed, its generics pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution business, to Cardinal Health for cash in the amount of $40.1 million. ParMed is presented in the financial statements contained in this 10-K Report, as a discontinued operation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, throughout this 10-K Report, "Discontinued Operations" refers to the Generics Business and ParMed. For further information on the Discontinued Operations, see the discussion of Discontinued Operations in Item 7 of this 10-K Report, and see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this 10-K Report.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M67"></A>PHARMACEUTICALS ("Pharmaceuticals")</P>
</B><I><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT> Pharmaceuticals is focused primarily on the prescription pain management market in the United States. It markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products, an extended release morphine sulfate pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN and a NSAID patch product sold in the U.S. beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. Both drugs are manufactured by third parties. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Pharmaceuticals had product sales, consisting solely of KADIAN, of approximately $167.7 million and an operating loss of approximately $61.5 million, which includes a $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA for the exclusive U.S. license rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel. KADIAN accounted for approximately 23% of the Company's total revenues in 2007 and all of Pharmaceuticals' revenues.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines.</I> KADIAN is an extended release morphine sulfate product that, until June 2006, F.H. Faulding &amp; Co. Limited (now integrated with Mayne Group Limited) licensed to Pharmaceuticals pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license. During the second quarter of 2006, Mayne Nickless Limited assigned the patent rights to Pharmaceuticals. In October, 2006, the Company received FDA approval for KADIAN 80 mg dosage strength and launched this line extension in the fourth quarter of 2006. In February 2007, the Company received FDA approval for KADIAN 200 mg dosage strength and launched this line extension during the second quarter of 2007. In February 2007, the Company also received FDA approval for KADIAN 10 mg dosage strength and launched this line extension during the third quarter of 2007. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FLECTOR Patch is the first prescription topical NSAID approved by the FDA in the U.S. Patent-protected FLECTOR Patch delivers anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of diclofenac epolamine and is indicated for the topical treatment of acute pain due to minor strains, sprains, and contusions. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company obtained exclusive license and distribution rights from Institut Biochimique SA ("IBSA"), a privately-owned, global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland, to market FLECTOR Patch in the United States. The Company launched FLECTOR Patch in the U.S. in January 2008.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the agreement entered into with IBSA in the third quarter of 2007, the Company also received exclusive U.S. license and distribution rights to TIROSINT gel capsules containing levothyroxine sodium for thyroid hormone replacement therapy, approved by the FDA in 2006. TIROSINT gel capsules are indicated for use as replacement or supplemental therapy in congenital or acquired hypothyroidism of any etiology, the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, and as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyroptropin-dependent well differentiated thyroid cancer. The Company is evaluating the optimum means to commercialize the product. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In March 2007, the Company entered into an exclusive development and license agreement with Tris Pharm, Inc. ("Tris"), a privately owned specialty pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which the Company gained access to Tris' novel and proprietary drug delivery platform for sustained release products. The Company is evaluating this technology to develop certain products that would be complementary to KADIAN. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of new pain products which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from its Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy trial for EMBEDA, its investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The trial of over 500 patients demonstrated that EMBEDA delivered statistically significant pain relief versus placebo. Pharmaceuticals is targeting the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2008 for EMBEDA. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs as well as investment in support for the launch and optimized commercialization of FLECTOR Patch. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factor - The Company's products and 
future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to a general inquiry by the FDA regarding alcohol interaction with opioids, the Company conducted in vivo studies to evaluate the interaction of alcohol consumption with KADIAN. The results indicated that the concomitant use of tested levels of alcohol with KADIAN has no significant impact on mean morphine blood levels. The Company provided this data to the FDA. Based upon its review, in February 2007 the FDA indicated that the KADIAN label did not require any further modifications. Pharmaceuticals has conducted a study to evaluate the interaction of alcohol consumption with EMBEDA and will provide this data to the FDA as part of its NDA filing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the abuse-deterrent technology described above, the Company expanded and enhanced its Pharmaceuticals' product pipeline in 2007 by licensing the exclusive U.S. rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical NSAID in Phase III clinical development, from IDEA, a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Munich, Germany. This license includes access to IDEA's innovative TRANSFERSOME technology platform that delivers drugs locally to targeted areas. The Company is targeting a product launch in 2011. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".<FONT FACE="Courier New">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</FONT><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities. </I>KADIAN capsules are manufactured under a toll manufacturing agreement with Actavis Elizabeth LLC ("Actavis"), successor to Purepac Pharmaceutical Co., the former subsidiary of the Company purchased by Actavis as a part of the Company's sale of the Generics Business. The Company is in the process of securing a second source for the manufacture of KADIAN. Actavis is, at present, its sole supplier. FLECTOR Patch is supplied to the Company by IBSA. The product is manufactured for IBSA by Teikoku Seiyaku Co. Ltd., a third party contract manufacturer located in Japan. Pharmaceuticals' headquarters are currently located in Piscataway and Bridgewater, New Jersey. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition. </I>Pharmaceuticals operates in a highly competitive, price-sensitive market. Pharmaceuticals' products compete with pain management products manufactured by generics pharmaceutical manufacturers and worldwide research-based brand drug companies. As the Company expands its Pharmaceuticals portfolio product line, it expects to encounter continued competition. Pharmaceuticals' principal competitors include: King Pharmaceuticals Inc., Purdue Frederick, Endo Pharmaceuticals, and Pfizer, Inc.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers.</I> The Company has a sales organization for Pharmaceuticals products comprised of its own internal sales force and a contract sales force. Pharmaceuticals has employed a sales force of approximately 400 sales representatives (although the actual number of representatives will vary from time to time based upon resignations and other normal personnel actions), an increase from approximately 190 sales representatives in 2006. The Company also contracts with Ventiv Commercial Services, LLC, a sales organization, for the services of approximately 130 contract sales representatives (full time and part time representatives) to market the FLECTOR Patch. Pharmaceuticals focuses its sales and marketing efforts on the pain specialists who are likely to be the most active writers of prescriptions for KADIAN and focuses on pain specialists, primary care physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and sports medicine physicians for its marketing 
efforts for FLECTOR Patch. Pharmaceuticals predominately sells its pharmaceutical products to major wholesalers. The Company has entered into distribution service agreements with certain of these companies. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS ("API")</P>
</B><FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M91"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;The Company's API business develops, manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients and one chemically synthesized active pharmaceutical ingredient that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's API business benefits from over four decades of experience in the use and development of fermentation and purification technology. For the year ended December 31, 2007, API had product sales of approximately $187.6 million and operating income of approximately $34.0 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 6, 2008, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell its API business to certain investment funds managed by 3i, a global private equity and venture capital company, for $395 million in cash. The final purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the closing net cash balance and working capital of the business. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2008, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.<A NAME="_DV_M92"></A></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines. </I>The Company's API business markets and sells 14 APIs, primarily antibiotics. These APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections. The Company is a leading producer of bacitracin, polymyxin, and vancomycin, all of which are important pharmaceutical-grade antibiotics. The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotic active substances such as tobramycin, colistin and colistin methanesulfonate, and amphotericin B, a parenteral grade antifungal. The primary applications for the API products are injectable and specialized topical and human surgical finished product applications. API owns European marketing authorizations for vancomycin vial and capsule finished products that are manufactured (using the Company's vancomycin) and distributed for the Company by third parties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has several growth initiatives related to API. API has initiated a program of new product launches (commercial sales of product) that began in 2005 with the launch of tobramycin and continued with the launch of fluticasone and teicoplanin in non-regulated markets in the third quarter of 2006, mupirocin acid in the fourth quarter of 2006 and mometasone in the fourth quarter of 2007. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to expand the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next several years. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced the sale of vancomycin manufactured at the Hisun facility into limited markets, and began enhancing the site's manufacturing processes in preparation for regulatory approvals. In 2007, API finalized its collaboration with Hisun pursuant to which Hisun commenced the construction of a new plant located in Taizhou, China for the manufacturing of vancomycin. The Taizhou plant, subject to the regulatory approval process, will be owned and operated by the Company and will incorporate certain technology purchased from Hisun, in addition to certain API technology. The new facility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parties, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M93"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2003, the Company's API business implemented a significant price increase for two of its products in certain geographical markets and, during 2005 and 2006, commenced reducing the prices of such products. The Company anticipates that further price reductions are possible on both of these products.<A NAME="_DV_M94"></A><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;Facilities. </I>The Company manufactures its API products in its plants in Oslo, Norway, which also manufactures products for AH, Copenhagen, Denmark and Budapest, Hungary. During 2008, it intends to manufacture certain of its products in its new Taizhou, China plant. Each plant includes fermentation, specialized recovery and purification equipment. To support the production of vancomycin, the Company substantially expanded its production capacity at its Copenhagen facility and, in 1998, acquired its facility in Budapest, Hungary. An expansion of manufacturing processes and capacity at the Budapest facility was substantially completed in 2004.<B> <A NAME="_DV_C9"></B>The expansion of the Budapest facility cost a total of approximately $9 million and doubled the capacity of the facility for vancomycin and established capacity for the production of three additional products in the facility.<B> <A NAME="_DV_M95"></A></A></B>The Company completed two expansion projects at its Copenhagen 
facility in 2004 for an aggregate cost of approximately $32 million. One of these projects significantly increased the capacity of the Copenhagen facility for vancomycin. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company substantially completed, for a cost of approximately $21 million through December 31, 2007, the expansion of its Copenhagen facility to accommodate API's initiative to expand into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. Also, in the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to expand the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next several years. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has incurred costs of approximately $10 million for this project. The Oslo, Copenhagen and Budapest facilities have been classified as acceptable by the FDA as manufacturers of certain sterile and non-sterile bul
k antibiotics. Such FDA classification, subject to compliance with applicable FDA rules, allows imports of the products manufactured at these facilities into the U.S. market and into most European markets. See "Information Applicable To All Business Segments - Environmental Compliance" for a discussion of environmental matters related to the Copenhagen, Oslo and Budapest facilities and "Government Regulation - FDA Compliance" for a discussion of the Company's FDA inspection results at the same three facilities<A NAME="_DV_M96"></A>.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition. </I>In sales to large and small customers, price, quality and service are the determining factors. The Company believes that its fermentation and purification expertise and established reputation provide it with a significant advantage in these antibiotic products. Competition has increased in recent years on certain of its products, most notably from Asian-based companies. The Company believes API's principal competitors are: Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Zheijiang Medicine Co Ltd Xinchang, Sandoz (LEK), Teva (Biogal), World Yanghen, Shanghai Pioneed and Livzon - Fuzhou. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M97"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic Markets.</I> The Company's API business sells its products in the U.S. and other areas of the world. For the year ended December 31, 2007, sales in North America of API products represented approximately 47% of the Company's API business' total revenues. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M98"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales, Distribution and Customers. </I>Sales of API products are dependent on finished product sales, which are under the control of the Company's customers. Sales of bulk antibiotic products are made to relatively few large customers, primarily pharmaceutical companies making generics and branded finished pharmaceutical products. The Company distributes and sells its API products in North America and Europe using its own sales force. Sales of the Company's API products in other parts of the world are made primarily through local agents and distributors. </P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M132"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Lines. </I>The Company's principal animal health business is based on a portfolio of anti-infective animal health products that are added to the feed and water of livestock and poultry. This market is comprised of three primary categories: antibiotics, anticoccidials and antibacterials.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M133"></A>Antibiotics</I>. The Company's MFAs and water-soluble products are used to prevent and/or treat diseases and maintain health in poultry, swine and cattle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH's main expansion initiatives focus on new products from research and development activities, the purchase of businesses or individual products from third parties, co-development and in-licensing and expanding the geographic reach of its current product line with new registrations in new jurisdictions. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "Risk Factors - The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".<A NAME="_DV_M151"><A NAME="_DV_M150"></A></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal drugs must be reviewed and receive registration from the FDA for marketing in the United States and approval or registration by similar regulatory agencies in other countries. Regulatory approvals for products to be used in food producing animals are complex due to the possible impact on humans. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M152"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval also must be granted in the U.S. for the use of an animal drug in combination with other animal drugs in feeds. Such combination approval generally requires the cooperation of other manufacturers to consent to authorize the FDA to refer to such manufacturer's New Animal Drug Application (or NADA) in <A NAME="_DV_M153"></A>support of the Company's regulatory submissions. This consent is necessary to obtain approval from the FDA for more than one animal drug to be included in a given animal drug animal feed at the same time. To date, the Company has been successful in obtaining the cooperation of third parties to seek combination approval for many of its products. Generally, the Company does not enter into written agreements with other manufacturers and does not pay any money to other manufacturers to obtain such consent. These combination clearances significantly extend the reach and potential market share of the Company's produc
ts and provide a considerable competitive advantage. Presently, the Company has sponsored a total of approximately 100 combination approvals in the U.S.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M154"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions and Divestitures</I>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2004, in order to relieve itself of future obligations for certain payments, the Company entered into an agreement with Natinco N.V., the licensor of certain technology related to REPORCIN, a product intended to improve meat quality, which substantially limited the geographic area in which the Company can market the product. While at the time of its 1999 purchase of the rights to manufacture and market REPORCIN, it was the Company's intent to build a global market for the product, sales were not material to the AH business and the Company discontinued sales, terminated its license and sold its remaining inventory in the fourth quarter of 2007.<A NAME="_DV_M155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2004, the Company sold assets relating to its Aquatic Animal Health Business to the senior management of the business for approximately $4.4 million. In connection with this transaction, AH received a final earn-out payment in December 2006 of appro
ximately $1.9 million. Additionally, in March 2004, the Company sold its AH distribution company to IVS Animal Health Inc. for approximately $17.0 million.<A NAME="_DV_M156"></A> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In April 2007, the Company acquired the assets of Shenzhou Tongde Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd ("Tongde") in Shenzhou City, China. Tongde was historically a manufacturer and supplier of zinc bacitracin for AH. Following the acquisition, AH has continued to sell zinc bacitracin to Tongde's customer base while also exporting the product to other markets. In June 2007, the Company acquired certain assets of Yantai JinHai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. located in Yantai City, Shandong Province, including product registrations that AH plans to use to expand its Asian product offering. AH intends to use this site to blend products it currently produces in its U.S. facilities and sells in Asia. The purchase of these assets for approximately $6.9 million has provided supply chain flexibility and has expanded the Company's regulatory base in Asia.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M157"><A NAME="_DV_M158"></A></A>Facilities. </P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company produces its Animal Health products in several manufacturing facilities. BMD is produced and blended at AH's Chicago Heights, Illinois facility, which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant. Albac is manufactured at the Shenzou, China facility and the Oslo, Norway facility, which is managed by API. A small volume of AH's products are manufactured at AH's Yantai, China facility. The majority of soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH's Longmont, Colorado facility. Feed grade chlortetracycline ("CTC") is produced at AH's Willow Island, West Virginia facility in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers. CTC is then blended at either Company-owned or independent blending facilities. The Willow Island facility also produces lasalocid for use in the U.S. as well as many other parts of the world. BIO-COX is blended in AH's Van Buren, Arkansas facility, as well as at a third-party location, and AVATEC and BOVATEC are blended at the Salisbury, Mary
land facility, as well as at a third-party location. The 3-NITRO product line <A NAME="_DV_M159"></A>is manufactured using the Company's technology at a third-party facility. Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in DECCOX, is manufactured, using the Company's technology, at a facility owned and operated by a third-party. In June of 2003, the blending of DECCOX was moved from the Company's Lowell, Arkansas facility to the Company's Chicago Heights facility. Process improvement and manufacturing development is done primarily at AH's Chicago Heights and Willow Island facilities. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Company makes significant use of third-party facilities (some of which are in low-cost countries) in the manufacture of its AH products and anticipates that this use will continue to increase in the future.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M161"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition. </I>The Company competes in a highly competitive market on the basis of brand name customer service, and price. Some of the Company's competitors in the animal health industry offer a wide range of products with various therapeutic and production enhancing qualities. Some of AH's principal competitors include Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco), Pennfield, Phibro Animal Health and Huvepharma. Due to the Company's strong market position in MFAs and its experience in obtaining requisite FDA approvals for combination claims, the Company believes it enjoys a competitive advantage in marketing MFAs under the FDA approved combination clearances. However, no assurances can be given that third parties will continue to cooperate in seeking combination approval for the Company's products, and the Company continues to expect additional new entrants in the generics medicated animal feed additive market in the foreseeable future. </P>

</B><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><I>General</I>. The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's Pharmaceuticals, API and AH products are subject to extensive government regulation by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other government agencies and by comparable authorities in the EU, Norway and other countries. Although Norway is not a member of the EU, it is a member of the European Economic Area and, as such, has accepted all EU regulations with respect to pharmaceuticals. Government regulation includes detailed inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, civil or criminal fines, act
ions, including prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and distribution, suspension or withdrawal of product approvals, the Company's debarment or the debarment of individuals from obtaining new drug approvals or providing services to drug companies in any capacity, refusal of the government to approve new products or to purchase the Company's products and criminal prosecution. The cost of complying with government regulations substantially increases the cost of producing the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements (including the possibility of future changes in statutes or regulations), the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and analogous state and foreign agencies, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time the Company will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite the Company's efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements. As a result of actions the Company has taken to respond to the progressively more demanding regulatory environment in which the Company operates, the Company has spent, and will continue to spend, significant funds and management time on regulatory compliance. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Product Marketing Authority and Protection from Generic Competition</I>. KADIAN and FLECTOR Patch are each the subject of an approved New Drug Application, or NDA, which has been reviewed by the FDA for both safety and effectiveness. The Agency has the continuing authority to consider the safety and effectiveness of all drugs subject to an approved NDA and, in appropriate circumstances, to order labeling changes, changes in or restrictions upon the drug's use or a cessation of the drug's sale and marketing. Third parties may offer a generic variation of a branded product that is the subject of an NDA if the generic product is the subject of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, and be approved by the FDA prior to marketing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All applications for regulatory approval of generic drug products subject to ANDA requirements must contain data relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and quality control, among other information. ANDAs also must contain data demonstrating the bioequivalence of the generic drug to the branded drug. In addition to meeting the above requirements for an ANDA, a generic version of KADIAN or FLECTOR Patch will not be approved by the FDA until the earlier of the expiration of the last to expire Orange Book (the FDA publication that lists, among others, patents protecting the active ingredient, formulation, and methods of use of a drug product) patents applicable to each product or the date upon which a third-party is able to demonstrate in the manner provided by law that either the patents covering the products are invalid or the generic equivalent product does not infringe the patents. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which 
amended both the Patent Code and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, procedures were codified and expanded with respect to applications for obtaining FDA approval for generic versions of patented drugs; including the institution of a statutory 30-month stay on the FDA authority to issue an ANDA commencing from the date a patent holder files a lawsuit challenging the generic applicants assertion of brand patent invalidity or non-infringement. See "Risk Factors --The Company's branded drug products, KADIAN and FLECTOR Patch, may experience general generic competition."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the Company's animal health products are regulated by the FDA or equivalent regulatory authorities around the world, similarly to human pharmaceuticals, while other animal health products are regulated primarily by individual States. Although the Company markets some generic animal drug products that are subject to FDA requirements similar to those as applicable to its human generic pharmaceutical products, many of its animal drug products are considered to be branded or pioneer animal drug products. Like their human counterparts, pre-marketing approval under stringent FDA rules for their testing, development, and manufacture is required for animal drugs, as well as for any changes in label claims, specifications or manufacturing sites that occur post-approval. The passage of the Animal Drug User Fee Act in late 2003 and its successful implementation by the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine has made review times more predictable; however changing regulatory requirements and poli
cies continue to make the timing of such approvals difficult to predict. Despite the difficulty and delays brought about by this situation, the Company has been successful in obtaining such approvals. As with human pharmaceutical products, FDA inspection and record keeping requirements as well as debarment provisions apply to the Company's animal health products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative bills are introduced in the U.S. Congress and individual states from time to time, some of which, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on AH's business. However, in the past, such bills that could have had a material adverse effect have not had sufficient support to become law. The animal health industry is actively engaged in the legislative process. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>EU Product Marketing Authority.</I> EU legislation requires that veterinary products used for medicinal purposes must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the EU. The criteria upon which grant of an authorization is assessed are quality, safety and efficacy. Demonstration of safety and efficacy in particular requires clinical trials, which are subject to the standards codified in the EU guideline on Good Clinical Practice; however certain countries granted membership in the EU as of May 1, 2004 may, until a given date specified for each country, individually authorize the continued marketing of products that do not qualify for marketing authorization under EU law if such products were approved by the individual country prior to being granted EU membership. Poland (until December 31, 2008) is the last country still benefiting from such transitional measures. No comparable transition system was established with regard to Bulgaria and Romania, w
hich joined the EU on January 1, 2007. Analogous governmental and agency approvals are required in other countries where the Company conducts business. If the Company fails to obtain such marketing authorizations, or fails to obtain them in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company's AH business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
On June 14, 2007, the EU legislature adopted Regulation 658/2007 "concerning financial penalties for infringement of certain obligations in connection with marketing authorizations granted under Regulation 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council." The Regulation establishes a centralized enforcement mechanism to be applied by the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission for imposing financial penalties on firms that fail to adequately maintain compliance with regulatory obligations applicable to certain medicinal products for human and veterinary use.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic medicinal products for veterinary use may be authorized in the EU through abridged authorization applications. For example, the EU marketing authorization applications do not need to contain results of tests and results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, provided that certain conditions are met, and, in particular, that the "original" medicinal product has been authorized in the EU for not less than 8 years in a Member State of the Community. A generic veterinary medicinal product authorized pursuant to the abridged procedure may not be placed on the market until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product. This 10-year period may be extended to 13 years in the case of veterinary medicinal products for fish or bees or other species designated following certain requirements. To qualify for abridged dossiers, the product must be considered to be a generic of a reference medicinal product. A generic medicinal product is a medicinal product which has 
the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances, the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, and whose bioequivalence to the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate studies. Different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, or derivatives of an active substance are considered to be the same active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with respect to safety and/or efficacy. In such cases, additional information demonstrating the safety and/or efficacy of the various salts, esters, or, derivatives of an authorized substance must be supplied by the applicant. However, results of safety and residue tests or pre-clinical tests or clinical trials are not required if the applicant can demonstrate that the active substances of the veterinary medicinal product have been in well-established veterinary use within the EU for at least 10 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. If th
e Company fails to satisfy the conditions for the use of abridged authorization applications for new products being developed by the Company, the process for the approval of such products could take significantly longer and cost substantially more to the Company. Generic feed additive products in the EU used to promote animal health (specifically anticoccidial products) and nutrition are regulated under different legislation than veterinary pharmaceuticals (Regulation 1831/2003). Applications for generic feed additives require the same types of data necessary to obtain authorization of the original product.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Union and a number of non-EU countries banned the use of four antibiotics to promote growth in food producing animals effective July 1, 1999. In the list of products banned in 1999, only one, zinc bacitracin (ALBAC), was manufactured and marketed by the Company. The Company's attempt to reverse or limit the EU ban that affects the Company's ALBAC product was not successful. Similar actions to ban or severely restrict the use in animals of antibiotics have been taken by EU trading partners or are being contemplated. On January 1, 2006, the ban was extended to the remaining approved growth-promoting antibiotics. In the list of products banned in 2006, only one, salinomycin, is marketed by the Company. See "Risk Factors - An expansion of the ban of the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals could result in a decrease in the Company's total sales". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU authorities are also considering restricting the use of non-antibiotic animal drugs. Pursuant to Regulation 1831/2003, the European Commission was scheduled to issue a report before January 1, 2008, on the use of coccidiostats and histomonostats and available alternatives, accompanied where appropriate by legislative proposals. This report was required with a view to phasing out the use of these substances by December 31, 2012. The Commission did not issue its report by January 1, 2008. It is understood that the report is still being finalized and is projected to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU in the spring of 2008. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other Product Marketing Authority. </I>Regulatory authorities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America impose requirements for obtaining manufacturing and marketing authorizations for veterinary products that may differ from those described above for the U.S. and EU. The Company must comply with the requirements for obtaining appropriate authorizations in the jurisdictions in which the products are marketed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2007, the Company acquired two manufacturing facilities in China that produce animal health drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients for distribution in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America markets. Authorities in China, in particular, have been actively strengthening the regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical products. Although most of this effort has focused on human drug products, future developments may impose additional requirements on the production of veterinary products in China. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taiwan, South Korea, and Brazil have implemented, or are expected to implement shortly, restrictions on the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The Company had marketed antibiotics for use in food-producing animals in these countries but will be required to curtail or discontinue those practices.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Facility Compliance</I>.<FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"> </FONT>The Company's AH manufacturing operations in the U.S., three of the Company's European API facilities that manufacture products for export to the U.S. and certain third-party plants where products are manufactured for sale by the Company in the U.S., including KADIAN and FLECTOR Patch, are required to comply with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations ("cGMP"). cGMP encompasses all aspects of the production process, including validation and record keeping, in addition to standards for facilities, equipment and personnel, and involves changing and evolving standards. There are similar cGMP regulations in other countries where the Company has manufacturing operations. The approvals held by the Company's customers (i.e., the manufacturers of the finished antibiotic products) identify the Company facilities that are permitted to supply APIs under each specific approval. The Company'
s facilities that produce for export to the U.S. are required to be registered with FDA as drug establishments and each API exported to the U.S. must be the subject of a drug listing. The Company is subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU requires that before a medicinal product can be manufactured and assembled, each company that carries out such an operation must hold a manufacturer's license and the manufacture and assembly must be in accordance with the marketing authorization and cGMP. It also requires that active substances used in medicinal products for human and veterinary use be manufactured following EU guidelines on good manufacturing practice. The EU follows the same international guidance with respect to cGMPs for APIs as the FDA. In addition, the EU has expanded its ability to conduct cGMP inspections of active substance manufacturers. The EU cGMP guidelines do not affect the ability of the responsible national competent authorities to establish specific registration requirements regarding active substances manufactured and/or marketed as such in their territory. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Elizabeth, New Jersey plant is a part of the Discontinued Operations and is no longer the direct responsibility of the Company, its regulatory status continues to be important to the Company since it is the location where KADIAN is manufactured. Between November 2002 and January 2003, the FDA conducted a routine general inspection at the Elizabeth plant. As a result of this inspection, the FDA issued inspection observations listing deviations from cGMP's (a "483 Report") on January 15, 2003. A comprehensive response was submitted on February 5, 2003. The FDA performed a follow-up inspection in late 2003 and issued another 483 Report citing continued deficiencies in compliance with FDA regulations. The Company was informed that the FDA performed a cGMP inspection at the Elizabeth plant during 2006. The inspection did not result in Actavis' inability to manufacture KADIAN. Details of inspections at the Company's third party manufacturers and the discussions between Actavis and the 
FDA may not be made available to the Company. See "Risk Factor - An interruption in the supply of KADIAN or FLECTOR Patch would be materially adverse to the Company's operations." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 2004, May 2005 and September 2005, the Company received 483 Reports with respect to its API facilities in Oslo, Norway, Copenhagen, Denmark and Budapest, Hungary, respectively, that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs. The Company responded to the FDA and the FDA determined that all three responses were satisfactory. As a result, all three facilities have the right to manufacture products for sale in the U.S. The Company has received 483 Reports from time to time in the past for it U.S. AH plants, all of which the Company believes it has adequately addressed. The Company received no 483 Reports in 2006 for its API and AH plants. In April 2007, the Company received two 483 Reports with respect to its AH facility in Eagle Grove, Iowa, that recorded observed deviations from cGMPs. The Company has responded to the FDA and the FDA has determined that the response was satisfactory. As a result, the Eagle Grove facility has maintained the right to manufacture products for sale in t

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential Liability for Current Products</I>. Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others. These studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products, including the Company's products, and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. While the Company believes that it is unlikely that an adverse finding in any single study regarding any of the Company's products will result in such regulatory measures without further findings, publicity raised by such a study could cause some of the Company's customers to decrease or stop their use of such product, resulting in an adverse affect
 on the sales of such product.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlled Substances Act</I>. The Company developed and sells KADIAN which is a "controlled substance", as defined in the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substance Act establishes certain security, personnel, reporting, record keeping and import and export requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), a division of the Department of Justice. The Company is registered by the DEA to distribute controlled substances; Actavis, the toll manufacturer of KADIAN, holds the DEA registration to manufacture KADIAN. The DEA has a dual mission: law enforcement and regulation. The DEA deals with the control of abusable substances and the equipment and raw materials used in making them. The DEA shares enforcement authority with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, another division of the Department of Justice. The DEA's regulatory responsibilities are concerned with the control of licensed handlers of controlled substances, and with the substances themsel
ves, equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent such articles from being diverted into illicit channels of commerce. The Company is not under any restrictions for noncompliance with the foregoing regulations, but there can be no assurance that restrictions or fines will not be imposed on the Company in the future.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Care Reimbursement</I>. The methods and level of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, including KADIAN and FLECTOR Patch, under Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic reimbursement programs are the subject of constant review by state and federal governments and private third-party payers such as insurance companies. The Company believes that U.S. government agencies will continue to review and assess alternative payment methodologies and reform measures designed to reduce the cost of drugs to the public. As a part of this effort, the federal government and various states have commenced administrative or court actions challenging the pricing practices of certain named drug manufacturers including the Company. Because the outcome of these and other health care reform initiatives is uncertain, the Company cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have. <FONT FACE="Courier New">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
</FONT>The Medicaid Drug Rebate legislation requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers to sign a rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The drug rebate program was amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA). Under the VHCA, drug manufacturers are also required to enter a pricing agreement with HHS for the Section 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). In addition, the VHCA requires drug manufacturers to enter into various agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Company is a participant in all these Federal programs. The VA's purchasing power may create pricing pressure which could offset any potential increase in sales.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under current law, all pharmaceutical manufacturers must rebate to state governments a percentage of the average manufacturer's price based on sales of outpatient drug products reimbursed under state Medicaid programs. The required rebate rate for manufacturers of brand products is currently the greater of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) per unit to the retail pharmacy class of trade for each product at the unit level, or the difference between the AMP and the Company's best price, as adjusted by the CPI-U based on launch date and current quarter AMP to any non-governmental customer. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, effective on January 1, 2006, the federal government began providing a prescription drug benefit to plan beneficiaries under Medicare Part D. Usage of pharmaceuticals may increase as a result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by Medicaid Part D prescription drug benefit. The drug benefit is administered by private sector plan sponsors who are responsible for negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain favorable pricing on behalf of plan beneficiaries. As a result, the purchasing power of plan sponsors may create pricing pressure which could offset any potential increase in sales. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company continues to participate in CMS-approved State Pharmacy Assistance Programs ("SPAP"). Most of SPAP patients are currently covered by Medicare Part D. The SPAP benefit is mostly a wrap-around benefit, it covers products that are not covered by Medicare and some lower income Medicare recipients receive a wrap around benefit once they hit the coverage gap. The Company also participates in State Supplemental Rebate Programs. It has signed agreements with most states for<STRIKE> </STRIKE>KADIAN to be placed on their Preferred Drug List (PDL), thereby reducing obstacles to coverage and increasing the likelihood that KADIAN will be the drug prescribed in its therapeutic class. </P>

<B><U><P>Item 1A. RISK FACTORS </P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's reports filed from time to time pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, include certain forward-looking statements. Like any company subject to a competitive and changing business environment, the Company cannot guarantee the results predicted in any of the Company's forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company depends on the development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's future success is largely dependent upon its ability to develop, manufacture and market commercially successful new products. Generally, the successful commercial marketing of the Company's products depends on completing the following steps in a time frame to allow the Company to be among the first to market a particular product:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>developing and testing the product; </LI>
<LI>proving that the product is safe and effective; and </LI>
<LI>filing for and receiving regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell the product in a timely manner. </LI></UL>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its Exclusive License Agreement with IDEA, which was entered into in September 2007, the Company's subsidiary, Alpharma Ireland Limited, agreed that IDEA will conduct the clinical development and testing of its licensed product candidate, ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel in order to obtain FDA approval for it. The prospects and timing of FDA approval of ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel will depend, in large part, upon the efforts of IDEA in executing the mutually agreed clinical and regulatory plan. There can be no assurance that ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel will ever be approved by the FDA, in which case, the Company would receive no return on its investment in the product candidate. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delays in the development, manufacture or marketing of new products will impact the Company's expenses and revenues. The Company cannot be sure that any product presently going through the process set forth above, or which may be chosen by the Company to enter this process in the future, will result in the timely and profitable commercial launch of a new product. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, in its continuing businesses, expended approximately $140.3 million, including the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA, $44.4 million and $26.9 million on research and development efforts in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company expects its total research and development spending in 2008, including potential product licensing milestone payments (including $77 million in potential payments for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel) to be 10 to 20% higher than 2007. Such research and development expenditures will reduce the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products that prove to be economically successful.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's marketing and promotional activities and price reporting are subject to significant government regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in adverse consequences including limiting the Company's ability to sell or market its products, damaging its business reputation and affecting its financial condition.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FDA regulates pharmaceutical promotional materials and requires that such materials be accurate, present full disclosure of product risks, be fairly balanced and be consistent with the approved product label. While the FDA approves labeling of pharmaceutical products, physicians are not limited to FDA approved indications or conditions of use when prescribing a drug. Such "off-label" prescribing is permissible, but the FDA restricts communications made by or on behalf of pharmaceutical companies relating to such off-label use. The Company could be subject to enforcement by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities if it fails to comply with the FDA's regulations in this area.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, the Company's promotional and marketing activities are subject to complex federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. These include false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, causing false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs, and healthcare anti-kickback statutes, which prohibit offering or paying remuneration to prescribers, purchasers, or formulary managers to induce them to purchase, prescribe, or recommend a government-reimbursable product. In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities. Failure to comply with these laws is punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including exclusion of the manufacturer's products from reimbursement under federal and state healthcare programs, civil and criminal fines, and imprisonment of individuals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Manufacturers of marketed pharmaceuticals are also required to calculate and submit pricing data to various federal government agencies and certain states as a condition of having their drugs covered under government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These prices are used by the programs to set reimbursement rates for the manufacturer's products and/or to calculate manufacturer discounts to the programs. The rules governing the calculation of these reported prices are complex. It is possible that the Company's methodologies for calculating these prices could be challenged under false claims laws or other laws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to promotional materials, marketing activities, and price reporting, it could face enforcement actions by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state Attorneys General and other enforcement authorities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including limiting the Company's ability to sell or market its products, subjecting the Company to potential criminal prosecution, damaging the Company's business reputation and affecting its financial condition through significant penalties.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is subject to government regulations and actions that increase the Company's costs and could prevent it from marketing and selling some of its products in certain countries. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation includes inspection of and controls over testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, record keeping, pricing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. While the Company does not keep records that segregate the cost of compliance with these government regulations, in the aggregate, such regulations substantially increase the cost of manufacturing, developing and selling the Company's products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. and other governments regularly review manufacturing operations, including API's plants in Oslo, Copenhagen and Budapest and AH's plants in the U.S., where products for the U.S. and other regulated markets are, or are intended to be, manufactured. These reviews have in the past and may in the future result in regulatory concerns requiring a response by the Company. Failure to adequately address these concerns could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including product approval delays, reduced production and production interruptions, among other things. The significance of the effect of any such failures depends on the severity of the remedy chosen by the government agency. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production or distribution and debarment of individuals from providing services to drug companies in any capacity or debarment of the Company from obtaining new d
rug approvals, resulting in current charges to income and the potential for future loss of income and increased operating expenses. In recent years, besides stepped up enforcement of cGMP requirements, the U.S. government has utilized equitable disgorgement as a means of enforcing compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA would not seek to impose similar sanctions on the Company and any such sanction could have a significant effect on the Company's business and operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are continually being conducted by the industry, government agencies (including studies required to be performed from time to time by the pharmaceutical company marketing a particular drug) and others. These studies, which increasingly employ more sophisticated methods and techniques, can question the safety and efficacy of currently marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing and, in certain countries, give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An expansion of the ban of the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals could result in a decrease in the Company's total sales. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the potential transfer of increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals to human pathogens is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals. While most of the government activity in this area has involved products other than those that the Company offers for sale, the European Union and a number of non-EU countries, including Norway and Turkey, banned the use of zinc bacitracin, a feed antibiotic growth promoter manufactured by the Company and others that has been used in livestock feeds for over 40 years, as a feed additive growth promoter. The Company has not sold this product as a feed additive growth promoter in these countries since the bans took effect (initially in the EU in July 1999; in Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, (the latter two now part of the EU) in 2000; and in N
orway in January 2006). The EU ban is based upon the "Precautionary Principle", which states that a product may be withdrawn from the market based upon a finding of a potential threat of serious or irreversible damage even if such finding is not supported by scientific certainty. Although the EU and non-EU actions negatively impacted the Company's business, they were not material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taiwan, South Korea, and Brazil have implemented, or are expected to implement shortly, restrictions on the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The Company had marketed antibiotics for use in food-producing animals in these countries but will be required to curtail or discontinue those practices. The actions by these countries may negatively impact the Company's business as a result of reduced sales. It is not yet known whether this reduction will be material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company cannot predict whether the present zinc bacitracin ban or other antibiotic restrictions will be expanded. If any one of the following occur: (i) the EU, countries within or outside the EU or meat importers act to prevent the importation of meat products from countries that allow the use of bacitracin-based or other antibiotic-containing products, (ii) there is an expansion of the zinc bacitracin ban to additional countries, such as the U.S., where the Company has material sales of bacitracin-based products, (iii) a similar ban is instituted relating to other antibiotic feed additives sold by the Company in the U.S. or in one or more other countries where the Company has material sales, or (iv) there is an increase in public pressure to discontinue the use of antibiotic feed additives, the resultant loss of sales could be material to the Company's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The Company cannot predict whether this antibiotic resistance c
oncern will result in expanded regulations or public pressure adversely affecting other antibiotic-based animal health products previously sold by the Company in the jurisdictions where the ban has been imposed or in other countries in which those products are presently sold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions of the antibiotic resistance issue continue actively in the U.S. Various sources have published reports concerning possible adverse human effects from the use of antibiotics in food animals. Some of these reports have asserted that major animal producers, some of whom are the Company's customers or the end-users of its products, are reducing the use of antibiotics. In July 2005, the FDA withdrew the approval of an antibiotic poultry water medication due to concerns regarding antibiotic resistance in humans. While the Company does not market this drug, this ruling would be significant if its conclusions were expanded to the medicated feed additives sold by the Company. It is uncertain what additional actions, if any, the FDA may take for approved animal drug products. However, the FDA has established a rating system to be used to compare the risks associated with the use of specific antibiotic products in food producing animals, including those sold
 by the Company. While the Company does not believe that the presently proposed risk assessment system would be materially adverse to its business, it is subject to change prior to adoption or to later amendment. The sales of the Company's AH segment are principally antibiotic-based products for use with food producing animals; therefore, the future loss of major markets, including the U.S., or negative publicity regarding this use of antibiotic based products, could have a negative impact on the Company's sales and income.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Potential adverse effects on human health linked to the raising or consumption of food producing animals using the Company's products could result in a decrease in the Company's sales. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the government find, or the public perceive, a risk to human health from consumption of food producing animals which utilize the Company's products (such as Avian flu) or as a by-product to the raising of such animals (such as the "Chicken Litter" litigation referred to in Item 3 of this 10-K Report), there may be a decline in either the sale of such food products, which would result in a decrease in the use of the Company's products, or a decrease in the use of the Company's products in the growing of such food producing animals. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the third parties with whom the Company does business depend on government approvals, and the failure to maintain these approvals could affect the supply of materials to the Company, hinder the Company's ability to license products, or affect the promotion, distribution or sale of the Company's products.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has affiliations, license and distribution agreements, manufacturing, and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory approvals sought by such third parties. The Company's vendors and third-party manufacturers, including Actavis, currently the sole source of supply for KADIAN, and IBSA, the holder of the New Drug Application and sole source supplier of FLECTOR Patch (through IBSA's contract manufacturer, Teikoku Seiyaku Co. Ltd., "Teikoku"), are subject to regulatory compliance requirements similar to those described herein with respect to the Company. If any one of these third parties is found to have significant regulatory violations, the Company could be materially negatively impacted if such violations result in an interruption of the supply of a product that relates to material Company sales. While the Company takes measures where economically feasible and available to secure back-up suppliers, many of the Company's pro
ducts come from a sole source supplier. There can be no assurance that such contingency plans will be able to provide adequate and timely product to eliminate any threat of interruption of supply of the Company's products to its customers or that these problems will not otherwise materially impact the Company's business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "An interruption in the supply of KADIAN or FLECTOR Patch would be materially adverse to the Company's operations" below.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interruption in the supply of the Company's raw materials or products or an adverse event at one of the Company's manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturing facilities could adversely affect the Company's operations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently purchases many of its raw materials and a number of its finished products from single suppliers, and many of its products are manufactured at a single facility, including FLECTOR Patch, which is supplied by IBSA and manufactured by Teikoku at its Japanese facility and KADIAN, which is manufactured by Actavis at its Elizabeth, New Jersey facility. While the Company relies on single source suppliers for many of its raw materials and for a number of its finished products, it relies on different suppliers for different raw materials and finished products. Any interruption in the supply of these materials or products or an adverse event at the facilities that manufacture and blend the Company's products, could decrease sales of the affected products. In this event, the Company may seek to enter into agreements with third parties to purchase raw materials or products or to lease or purchase new manufacturing facilities. The Company may be u
nable to find a third-party willing or able to provide the necessary products or facilities suitable for manufacturing pharmaceuticals on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company had to obtain substitute materials or products, the Company would require additional regulatory approvals, as approvals are specific to a single product produced by a specified manufacturer. The use of new facilities, similarly, would require regulatory approvals. Any significant interruption of supply from the Company's sole source raw material suppliers or third-party manufacturing facilities that are related to products that generate more than $5.0 million in gross profits or any adverse event at any of its manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Six raw materials used in Company products that each generated more than $5.0 million in gross profits in 2007 were purchased by the Company from sole source suppliers. The sole source suppliers that provided these raw materials w
ere: Bayer Crop Science, Cambrex Corporation, Trader's Protein, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Roquette America, and Second Pharma Co., Ltd. Additionally, four finished product sole source suppliers supplied finished products generating more than $5.0 million in gross profits in 2007 including Actavis, the supplier of KADIAN. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">See "An interruption in the supply of KADIAN or FLECTOR Patch would be materially adverse to the Company's operations" below.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interruption in the supply of KADIAN or FLECTOR Patch would be materially adverse to the Company's operations. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant Company product manufactured by a third-party is KADIAN, which is manufactured under a toll manufacturing agreement with the Company's former generic subsidiary sold to Actavis as a part of the Generics Business transaction. The Company is in the process of securing a second source for the manufacture of KADIAN. Actavis is, at present, its sole supplier. Actavis has, in the past, had certain FDA regulatory issues at the plant where KADIAN is manufactured, including a Form 483 issued during 2006. In addition, the Company no longer controls the Elizabeth plant of Actavis and it can no longer require that KADIAN manufacturing be given any particular priority when compared with the products manufactured for Actavis' own sales. Any interruption in the supply of KADIAN would have a material adverse effect on the Company. This effect could be particularly severe since many patients acclimate to the brand of pain product which they are using a
nd, as a result, forcing a KADIAN user to switch to a competitive product could cause a reluctance of that individual to resume his or her use of KADIAN once supplies of the product were again available, as well as potentially cause some physicians to favor competitive products for new patients.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Additionally, the Company's product, FLECTOR Patch, is manufactured by its sole source supplier, IBSA (through IBSA's contract manufacturer, Teikoku, located in Japan). The Company has no direct contractual relationship with Teikoku. Any interruption in supply of FLECTOR Patch would have a material adverse effect on the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>A delay in or the failure to launch EMBEDA and TIROSINT could be materially adverse to the Company's operations.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two significant patents on the Company's KADIAN product will expire in 2010 and the other patent will expire in 2011, although patent protection may be lost at an earlier date under certain circumstances. (See "The Company's branded drug product, KADIAN, may experience general generic competition" in the Risk Factors below.) Pharmaceuticals has conducted Phase III activities on a new abuse deterrent form of extended release morphine sulfate, EMBEDA. In November 2007, the Company announced successful Phase III results for EMBEDA. As a result, the Company is targeting an NDA filing for EMBEDA in the first quarter of 2008. The Company's failure to launch this product in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company's financial results and operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In connection with its Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement, dated August 16, 2007, with IBSA (the "IBSA Agreement"), Pharmaceuticals made investments with respect to its TIROSINT product, including a combined $100 million upfront payment to obtain the rights to this product and FLECTOR Patch. The IBSA Agreement, as amended, also sets out required time periods within which Pharmaceuticals must launch TIROSINT and certain minimum purchase requirements. Penalties will be imposed if such requirements are not met. The Company's failure to launch this product or comply with the minimum purchase requirements according to the time line set forth in the IBSA Agreement could materially adversely affect the Company's financial results and operations.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A material portion of the Company's sales and gross profits is dependent on a relatively small number of products.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven products (Pharmaceuticals' KADIAN, AH's CTC, BMD and Lasalocid and API's vancomycin, polymyxin and bacitracin) in the aggregate constituted approximately 75% of the Company's 2007 sales and 88% of gross profits. The loss of significant sales of any one or more of such products for any reason, including any of the risks related to such products described in this 10-K Report, would have a material adverse effect upon the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2008, the Company commenced sales of its FLECTOR Patch product. The Company has made substantial investments with respect to FLECTOR Patch including a combined $100 million upfront payment to obtain the rights to this product and TIROSINT as well as substantial investments in increasing the size of its sales force. The Company is expecting significant future sales from FLECTOR Patch. The contract with IBSA contains certain minimum purchase requirements. Penalties will be imposed if such requirements are not met. The failure of the Company to meet its sales goals for FLECTOR Patch would have a material adverse effect on the Company.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's international operations are subject to additional economic and political risks.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's international operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations and restrictions, political instability in some countries, and uncertainty as to the enforceability of, and government control over, commercial rights. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company sells its AH and API products in many countries that are susceptible to significant foreign currency fluctuations. A majority of sales of the Company's API products are denominated in U.S. dollars, increasing credit risk if local currencies devalue significantly and it becomes more expensive for customers to purchase U.S. dollars required to pay the Company. In addition, a majority of API costs are denominated in European currencies, thereby exposing the Company to exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and those European currencies.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
In all the Company's businesses, it may become more difficult for the Company to respond to competitive challenges because of its size and product mix and the rapidly changing market.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industries in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive and many of the Company's competitors are affiliated with entities that are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company possesses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain countries, because of the Company's size and product mix, the Company may not be able to capitalize on changes in competition and pricing as fully as the Company's competitors. In recent years, new competitors have entered the generic medicated animal feed additive market, particularly in the United States. Additionally, the Company's API business may be subject to increased competitive challenges, particularly, but not exclusively, with respect to those products for which the Company implemented significant price increases during 2003. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's branded pharmaceutical drug products, KADIAN and FLECTOR Patch, may experience generic competition</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's branded drug product line may face challenges from generic competitors. The Company has three patents that cover KADIAN (expiring in 2010 and 2011), two of which could be subject to paragraph IV challenges prior to their expiration date, though there have been no such challenges to date. FLECTOR Patch has one patent in force that is listed in the Orange Book (the FDA's publication of approved drugs) which expires in 2014 and is the subject of an application seeking a 5 year patent term extension. With respect to KADIAN, the Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be able to successfully defend its patent position or utilize the statutory 30-month stay on FDA approval of the generic ANDA, since either result is dependent upon the Company being able to meet the statutory requirements for filing a lawsuit challenging the generic product based upon a bona fide belief that the generic product infringes one or more patents. The existence of suc
h belief cannot be determined until the Company has the opportunity to review the relevant paragraph IV filing. With respect to FLECTOR Patch, the Company cannot offer any assurance that a generic competitor will not attempt to invalidate or claim non-infringement with respect to the intellectual property covering the FLECTOR Patch. Furthermore, under the contract with IBSA for the FLECTOR Patch, IBSA has the first right, but not the duty, to institute infringement actions against third parties. Upon entry of a generic equivalent in the market, the Company's branded product could lose substantial sales and the price could materially decline.</P>
<B><P>The Company's <FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents.<U> </P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain of the Company's products and product candidates, including EMBEDA, and technologies, including its abuse deterrent technology, are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents. As a result, other companies may hold patents that may be used to challenge the Company's freedom to manufacture and sell certain products in the relevant jurisdictions. If such challenges are successful, the Company may be prevented from selling its products or required to license relevant patents and pay significant fees or royalties to third parties. Licenses may not be available on favorable terms to the Company. Alternatively, the Company may have to defend an infringement action and challenge the validity of third-party patents in court, a costly and time consuming process. The defense of such suits could result in unfavorable outcomes or could cause the Company to abandon its defense of such a suit and abandon and withdraw the relevant product(s). If the Company do
es not obtain a license in such a case, or if it is found liable for infringement and is unable to have such patents declared invalid or unenforceable, the Company may be liable for significant monetary damages, may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market, or may be precluded from manufacturing, using, or selling these products. </P>
</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's policies regarding sales returns, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers and other customers, may reduce the Company's revenue in future fiscal periods.</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on industry practice in the U.S., brand pharmaceutical manufacturers such as the Company have return policies, rebates paid to commercial and government entities in connection with sales made to enrollees in certain health plans, and chargebacks to wholesale customers in connection with sales they make to certain categories of customers, such as hospitals or group purchasing organizations. Although the Company establishes reserves based upon its prior experience and certain other information that reflect the Company's best estimate of the impact that these policies will have in subsequent periods, actual results could differ from these estimates and impact the Company's financial results. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's liability from accidents, product liability or other claims may exceed the Company's insurance coverage.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company seeks to obtain liability and direct damage insurance to protect it from liability due to accidents, product liability and other claims that arise in the course of doing business. While, based upon historical claims levels, the Company believes its present insurance is adequate for current and projected operations, insurance that the Company seeks to obtain in the future to protect itself against these potential liabilities may be inadequate, unobtainable or prohibitively expensive. A materially adverse result in the AH litigation relating to its 3-NITRO product (See "Legal Proceedings - Chicken Litter Litigation") could result in losses that exceed the Company's insurance coverage. The Company is subject to renewal of most of its insurance policies each year and changes are anticipated at each renewal. In past years, the Company has experienced increases in its insurance costs and certain coverage reductions, including coverage exclusions pert
aining to 3-NITRO and certain other products that it now manufacturers or may manufacture in the future. The Company's inability to obtain and maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to continue to pursue product-specific licensing and marketing agreements, co-development opportunities and other partnering arrangements. The Company may also pursue selective product and company acquisitions. The Company cannot be sure that it will be able to locate suitable partners for these transactions. In addition, assuming the Company identifies suitable partners, the process of effectively entering into these arrangements involves risks that the Company's management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns and that the Company may have difficulty integrating the new arrangements into its existing business. In addition, certain transactions could adversely impact earnings as the Company incurs development and other expenses related to the transactions and the Company could incur debt to complete these transactions. Debt instruments could contain contractual commitments and covenants that could adversely affect th
e Company's cash flow and its ability to operate its business.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, certain of the Company's partners, such as IBSA, have entered into arrangements with third parties relating to supply of the Company's products. The Company does not have any control over such third party arrangements.</P>
<B><P>Non-compliance with environmental waste discharge regulations could adversely affect production at two European plants of the Company. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"> During 2005, the environmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Copenhagen API manufacturing facility gave the Company notice of revised waste discharge levels. The Company believes it has taken the actions necessary to comply with the requirements, including certain plant alterations and modifications at a cost not material to the Company. The environmental authorities have not confirmed whether the Company's actions are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the notice.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2007, the Company paid a reduced criminal fine of $0.8 million in settlement of specified past accidental discharge activities at the Oslo API facility. Separately, in September 2007, the environmental authority having jurisdiction over the Oslo API plant of the Company gave the Company notice that it believes certain ordinary course discharge activities at the facility have not been in compliance with discharge levels permitted under the Company's permit during that period. The Company has responded to the authority's request for further information and indicated it believes it has been in compliance with its permit with respect to its ordinary course discharge activities. The environmental authority has procured additional testing and expert opinions that the Company believes support its position that such ordinary course discharge levels are in compliance with the Company's permit. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations could result in further criminal or civil actions affecting production at these facilities which could be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Past restatements of the Company's financial statements and certain matters related to internal controls may present a risk of future restatements and lead to an inability to report on the financial status of the Company on a timely and fair basis. </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2005, the Company revised its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 to disaggregate its U.S. Generics Pharmaceuticals ("USG") and Pharmaceuticals businesses as separate reportable segments. In May 2005, the Company revised its 2004 financial statements to change the classification of certain of its outstanding debt as current liabilities and to amend disclosures related to the Company's compliance with certain of its debt covenants at December 31, 2004 and 2003. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has made significant investments to enable it to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act"). Compliance with Section 404 of the Act was first required as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. The Company has undergone a significant effort to document, test, and assess its internal controls. At December 31, 2004, the Company identified four material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting: (i) ineffective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts at the Company's USG business; (ii) ineffective internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax accounts, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes payable and income tax expense; (iii) ineffective internal controls over the determination of proper segment disclosures; and (iv) ineffective controls to ensure the appropriate review and monitoring of its compliance 
with certain of its debt covenants. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the Company implemented actions to remediate the four material weaknesses identified at December 31, 2004. The Company believes the actions it took in 2005 and the enhanced control procedures it implemented served to remediate the four material weaknesses identified at December 31, 2004. However, at December 31, 2005, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting for income taxes related specifically to the timeliness and accuracy of tax accounting related to the disposition of the USG business and related fourth quarter transactions. In addition, management identified, and developed remediation plans to address certain other control deficiencies which were not material weaknesses at December 31, 2005. During 2006, the Company took actions and remediated the material weakness related to the financial reporting for income taxes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, utilizing the criteria described in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). The objective of this assessment was to determine whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. Based on that assessment, the Company believes that, at December 31, 2007, its internal control over financial reporting was effective.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In future years, there are no assurances that the Company will not have material weaknesses that would be required to be reported or that the Company will be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Act. A significant material weakness or the failure to meet the requirements of Section 404 could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">______________________________</P>
<B><P>Item 3. Legal Proceedings </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, of a nature considered normal to its business. It is the Company's policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of the Company, although the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with the following legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.</P>
<B><P>Chicken Litter Litigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is one of multiple defendants that have been named in several lawsuits which allege that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce manure that contains an arsenical compound which, when used as agricultural fertilizer by chicken farmers, degrades into inorganic arsenic and causes a variety of diseases in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields). The Company has provided notice to its insurance carriers and its primary insurance carriers have responded by accepting their obligations to defend or pay the Company's defense costs, subject to reservation of rights to later reject coverage for these lawsuits. In addition, one of the Company's carriers has filed a Declaratory Judgment action in state court in which it has sought a ruling concerning the allocation of its coverage obligations to the Company among the Company's several insurance carriers and, to the extent the Company does not have full insurance
 coverage, to the Company. In addition, this Declaratory Judgment action requests that the Court rule that certain of the carrier's policies provide no coverage because certain policy exclusions allegedly operate to limit its coverage obligations under said policies. Furthermore, the Company's insurance carriers may take the position that some, or all, of the applicable insurance policies contain certain provisions that could limit coverage for future product liability claims arising in connection with such AH product sold on and after December 16, 2003. &#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the approximately 152 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are asking for punitive damages and requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue. In September 2006, in the first trial, which was brought by two plaintiffs, the Circuit Court of Washington County, Arkansas, Second Division entered a jury verdict in favor of the Company. The plaintiffs have appealed the verdict. The court has ruled that future trials are on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. While the Company can give no assurance of the outcome of these matters, it believes that it will be able to continue to present credible scientific evidence that its product is not the cause of any injuries the plaintiffs may have suffered. There is also the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in these lawsuits, as well as additional lawsuits in other jurisdictions where the product has been so
ld. Worldwide sales of this product were approximately $23.1 million in 2005, $22.2 million in 2006 and $20.4 million in 2007.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brazilian Tax Claims</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the subject of tax claims by the Brazilian authorities relating to sales and import taxes which aggregate approximately $10.0 million. The claims relate to the operations of the Company's AH business in Brazil since 1999. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its position against these claims.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Environmental Regulations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the environmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Copenhagen API manufacturing facility gave the Company notice of revised waste discharge levels. The Company believes it has taken the actions necessary to comply with the requirements, including certain plant alterations and modifications at a cost not material to the Company. The environmental authorities have not confirmed whether the Company's actions are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2007, the Company paid a reduced criminal fine of $0.8 million in settlement of specified past accidental discharge activities at the Oslo API facility. Separately, in September 2007, the environmental authority having jurisdiction over the Oslo API plant of the Company gave the Company notice that it believes certain ordinary course discharge activities at the facility have not been in compliance with discharge levels permitted under the Company's permit during that period. The Company has responded to the authority's request for further information and indicated it believes it has been in compliance with its permit with respect to its ordinary course discharge activities. The environmental authority has procured additional testing and expert opinions that the Company believes support its position that such ordinary course discharge levels are in compliance with the Company's permit. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations could result in further criminal or civil actions affecting production at these facilities which could be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information Request</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 28, 2007, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain documents relating to the marketing of KADIAN. The subpoena did not disclose any allegations underlying this request. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FLSA Class Action</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purported class action lawsuit has been filed with the United States District Court in New Jersey. The complaint alleges that, among other things, (i) over 200 of the Company's U.S. based Pharmaceuticals sales representatives were denied overtime pay, in violation of state and federal labor laws, by being paid for forty hour weeks even though they worked in excess of fifty-five hours per week, and (ii) that the Company violated federal record-keeping requirements. Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class action will result in liability which would be material to the Company's financial position. <FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its positions in these lawsuits. Numerous other pharmaceutical companies are defendants in similar lawsuits. </P>
</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Average Wholesale Price Litigation </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, and in certain instances, Pharmaceuticals, are defendants in various lawsuits in state, city and county courts, based upon allegations that fraudulent Average Wholesale Prices ("AWP") were reported primarily in connection with KADIAN for varying numbers of years under governmental Medicaid reimbursement programs. The plaintiffs in these cases include state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drug at issue based on AWP. These lawsuits vary with respect to the particular causes of action and relief sought. The relief sought in these lawsuits includes statutory causes of action including civil penalties and treble damages, common law causes of action, and declaratory and injunctive relief, including, in certain lawsuits, disgorgement of profits. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its positions in these lawsuits. Numerous other pharmaceutical companies are defendants in similar law
suits. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Commercial Disputes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products. Given the fact that these disputes will most likely be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position. However, they could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows in the period in which resolution occurs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any further responsibilities for substantially all of the material contingent liabilities related to the Generics Business have been transferred to Actavis or entities owned by Actavis, subject to certain representations or warranties made by the Company to Actavis as a part of the transaction to the extent such representations and warranties were incorrect. The Company has retained certain specified liabilities that it believes are not material to the Company and, it is possible that the Company may be held responsible for certain liabilities of the Generics Business transferred to Actavis in the event Actavis fails or is unable to satisfy such liabilities.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Litigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, involved in other litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business. It is the view of management, after consultation with counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all other pending suits on an individual basis should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma Inc. ("Alpharma" or the "Company") is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals. The Company markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products that are contract manufactured by third-parties: a pain medication sold under the trademark KADIAN<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, in the U.S., and a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product marketed in the U.S., beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. Alpharma manufactures and markets a line of fermentation-based active pharmaceutical ingredients and one chemically synthesized active pharmaceutical ingredient (collectively "APIs") that are used primarily by third parties in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products. The Company manufactures and markets animal health products consisting of medicated feed additives ("MFAs") and water soluble therapeutics for
 production animals; principally, poultry, cattle and swine. The Company presently conducts business in more than 80 countries and has approximately 2,000 employees in over 20 countries. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company reported revenues of approximately $722.4 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September 2007, the Company's affiliate, Alpharma Pharmaceuticals LLC, closed on two license and distribution agreements with Institut Biochimique SA ("IBSA") to distribute and market two FDA approved products in the United States: the FLECTOR Patch and TIROSINT gel capsules (See Note 5).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 2007, the Company's affiliate, Alpharma Ireland Limited ("Alpharma Ireland"), closed on an agreement with IDEA AG, to license the exclusive U.S. rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ("NSAID") in clinical development (See Note 5). </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequent event</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February 2008, the Company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its API business to certain investment funds managed by 3i, a global private equity and venture capital company, for $395 million in cash. The final purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the closing net cash balance and working capital of the business and is expected to generate net proceeds, after taxes, fees, and expenses, of approximately $365 million. The Company will record a gain upon closing of the transaction, which is expected in the second quarter of 2008 (See Note 25).</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M32"></A>&#9;Until December 28, 2006, A.L. Industrier ASA ("A.L. Industrier") beneficially owned all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock, or approximately 22% of the Company's total common stock as of such date. Through its ownership of the Class B common stock, Industrier had voting power that provided it with effective control of the Company. On December 28, 2006, the Company purchased 100% (11,872,897 shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from Industrier at a price of $25.50 per share. Including related fees, the cost of the repurchase was approximately $307.4 million, which was paid using available cash on hand. Following the Class B share repurchase, control of the Company now rests in the holders of the Class A shares acting by the majority applicable under Delaware law and the Company's charter documents. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discontinued Operations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On December 19, 2005, the Company sold its worldwide human generic pharmaceutical business (the "Generics Business"), excluding ParMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("ParMed"), its generic pharmaceutical telemarketing distribution unit, to Actavis Group hf ("Actavis") for cash in the amount of $810 million. On March 31, 2006, the Company sold ParMed for cash in the amount of $40.1 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Generics Business and ParMed (collectively, the "Discontinued Operations"), are classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2007. See Discontinued Operations and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and analysis.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continuing Operations </P>
</B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main factors affecting the Pharmaceuticals business are</I>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>Pharmaceuticals is focused primarily on the pain management market in the United States. It markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products, a pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN and a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product marketed in the U.S., beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. Both drugs are manufactured by third parties. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Pharmaceuticals had product sales, consisting solely of KADIAN, of approximately $167.7 million and an operating loss of approximately $61.5 million. Included in this loss was a research and development charge of $60 million related to the initial upfront payment to IDEA AG for the exclusive U.S. rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, an NSAID in clinical development. KADIAN accounted for approximately 23% of the Company's total revenues in 2007.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pharmaceuticals realizes significant gross profit margins on its sales of KADIAN, but competes in a highly competitive market, and is subject to potential challenges from generic equivalents. The Company's business plan includes significant investments in research and development spending to broaden its product pipeline. This includes investments associated with the development of next-generation opioid pain products which include technology designed to deter abuse and potential milestone payments to IDEA AG for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical NSAID in clinical development. In connection with its January 2008 launch of the FLECTOR Patch, Pharmaceuticals has made significant investments in sales and marketing in support of an expanded sales force and promotional activities. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main factors affecting the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) business are:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API markets globally API's (primarily antibiotics) that are generally used by third parties in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products. API realizes strong gross profit margins and has experienced and expects continuing increased global competition on its products and associated pricing pressures. For the year ended December 31, 2007, API had product sales of $187.6 million and operating income of $34.0 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to expand the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next several years. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced the sale of vancomycin manufactured at the Hisun facility into limited markets, and began enhancing the site's manufacturing processes in preparation for regulatory approvals. In 2007 API finalized its collaboration with Hisun pursuant to which Hisun commenced the construction of a new plant located in Taizhou, China for the manufacturing of vancomycin that, subject to the regulatory approval process, will be owned and operated by the Company and will incorporate certain technology purchased from Hisun, in addition to certain API technology. The new facility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008. Another of API's main expansi
on initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company substantially completed the expansion of its Copenhagen facility to accommodate API's initiative to expand into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As previously discussed, in February 2008, the Company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its API business to certain investment funds managed by 3i, a global private equity and venture capital company (See Note 25).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<I>The main factors affecting the Animal Health (AH) business are:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's AH business is a global leader in the development, registration, manufacturing and marketing of medicated feed additives ("MFAs") and water soluble therapeutics for food producing animals; including poultry, cattle, and swine. Agricultural markets have historically had low growth rates. In addition, demand for the Company's products has been and could be reduced by bans or restrictions on the use of antibiotics used in food-producing animals. AH has increased its revenues and profitability through expanding and enhanced market positions, new products, new indications for existing products, and cost-reduction and other productivity improvement initiatives. Material increases in production costs, including commodity prices (e.g. corn and soy), may have a negative effect on the gross profits of the business. For the year ended December 31, 2007, AH had product sales of $367.1 million and operating income of $72.6 million.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A discussion of revenues and operating income by segment, follows:</P>
<B><P>Revenues:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals revenues, consisting solely of KADIAN, increased $29.5 million, or 21.3%, to $167.7 million in 2007 compared to $138.2 million in 2006. The revenue growth was principally attributable to increased volumes ($17.7 million) driven by growth in prescriptions, higher year-over-year pricing ($7.3 million), and the launch of additional dosage strengths (new line extensions) of KADIAN ($4.5 million). In preparation for the January 2008 launch of the FLECTOR Patch, the Company commenced shipment of the product to certain distributors in December 2007. As a result, at December 31, 2007, the Company recorded deferred revenue of approximately $3.0 million related to the FLECTOR Patch shipments. The Company expects to begin recognizing revenues related to its shipments of the FLECTOR Patch in the first quarter of 2008, utilizing prescription and other accumulated data as a basis for its estimation of the revenues to be recognized. </P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Revenues in API increased $18.9 million, or 11.2%, to $187.6 million compared to $168.7 million in 2006. A small portion of API revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Translation of these revenues into the U.S. dollar increased API revenues by approximately $4.4 million in comparison to 2006. Excluding the year-over-year effects of currency, API revenues increased 8.6% versus the prior year. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes, principally related to vancomycin. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH revenues increased $20.2 million or 5.8%, to $367.1 million in 2007 versus $346.9 million in 2006. Translation of revenues into the U.S. dollar increased AH revenues by approximately $6.8 million in comparison to 2006. Excluding the year-over-year effects of currency, AH revenues increased 3.9% versus prior year. The increase in revenues was due primarily to higher sales in U.S. poultry and livestock of approximately $5.6 million, as well as increased revenues in the European and Latin American markets of approximately $7.8 million.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gross Profit:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>On a Company-wide basis gross profit increased $27.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 56.7% in 2007, versus 58.4% in 2006, with the decline principally attributable to the unfavorable effects of currency, lower year-over-year pricing in API, and higher production costs in API and AH, primarily for raw materials partially offset by higher gross profits in Pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operating Expenses:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a consolidated basis, selling, general and administrative ("SG&amp;A") expenses increased $21.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of $6.4 million on the year-over-year change in SG&amp;A expenses. The remainder of the dollar increase principally relates to the expansion of the Pharmaceuticals sales force and related marketing expenses in preparation for the January 2008 launch of the FLECTOR Patch, as well as additional operational infrastructure to support increased revenues and growth initiatives in all three businesses. These increases were partially offset by lower corporate and unallocated expenses. As a percentage of revenues, SG&amp;A expense was 37.6% in 2007 versus 38.2% in 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development expenses increased $95.8 million compared to 2006, due primarily to the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA, and spending related to clinical trials related to abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs in Pharmaceuticals. As a percentage of revenues, R&amp;D expenses amounted to 19.4% (or 11.1%, excluding the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA) in 2007 compared to 6.8% in 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset impairments and other (income) expense amounted to income of $3.5 million in 2007 compared to income of $8.3 million in 2006. The income in 2007 pertains to facility exit cost adjustments and asset sales related to previously closed AH facilities. The income in 2006 primarily consists of a net curtailment gain of $7.5 million from the freezing of Norwegian and U.S. pension plans.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tax Provision:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's effective tax rate ("ETR") is dependent on many factors including: a.) the impact of enacted tax laws in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; b.) the amount of earnings by jurisdiction, due to varying tax rates in each country; and c.) the Company's ability to utilize various tax losses and credits. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $22.9 million. The Company's financial results include the $60.0 million up front payment made from Alpharma Ireland to IDEA in October 2007 (see Note 5). In connection with this payment, and other expenses incurred by Alpharma Ireland, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $7.6 million, representing the future potential tax benefits associated with these amounts. The Company recorded a corresponding full valuation allowance for this deferred tax asset, as Alpharma Ireland is a start-up operation for a product in development, and the Company has no basis to conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $32.5 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which became effective for the Company, January 1, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following summarizes revenues and operating income by segment:</P>
<B><P>Revenues:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals revenues increased $36.6 million, or 36.0%, to $138.2 million in 2006 compared to $101.6 million in 2005. The revenue growth was primarily a result of increased year-over-year prescriptions which contributed to volume increases of $17.5 million and higher price realization which contributed $19.1 million of the year over year increase. Included in the net volume gain is the impact of a reduction in wholesaler inventory levels in 2006 from approximately three months at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005, to approximately one and a half months at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006. </P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Revenues in API increased $30.3 million, to $168.7 million compared to $138.4 million in 2005. Revenues in 2006 included approximately $16.8 million of low margin sales of products that, in 2005, were reported as sales by the Company's divested Generics Business. The remainder of the revenue increase of $13.5 million, or 9.8%, was attributable to increase volumes, principally related to vancomycin, partially offset by pricing declines. The effect of translating revenues into U.S. dollars was insignificant.<FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH revenues increased $21.8 million or 6.7%, to $ 346.9 million in 2006 versus 2005, due primarily to higher volumes in U.S. livestock markets of approximately $13 million and increased sales into international markets of approximately $6.4 million. In addition, translation of revenues into the U.S. dollar increased AH revenues by approximately $1.7 million compared to 2005.<FONT FACE="Arial"> </P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Gross Profit:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Overall, the Company's<B> </B>gross profit increased $45.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 58.4% in 2006, versus 60.7% in 2005</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in gross profit dollars is the result of increased volumes in all three business segments and favorable price realization in Pharmaceuticals. The lower gross profit percentage is primarily a result of low margin sales of API products that, in 2005, were reported as sales by the Company's divested Generics Business. In addition, the decline in gross profit percentage reflects lower gross margins in the API business attributable to lower pricing on certain products and increased costs associated with new product development, geographic expansion, and certain asset write-downs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operating Expenses:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a consolidated basis, selling, general and administrative ("SG&amp;A") expenses increased $36.7 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. As a percentage of revenues, SG&amp;A expense was 38.2% in 2006 versus 38.5% in 2005. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority, or $26 million of the year-over-year increase, was across all three businesses for additional operational infrastructure to support the Company's growth initiatives and also reflects higher distribution costs in 2006. The remainder of the increase relates primarily to costs related to senior management retention and transition, and the discontinuance of the Company's performance unit plan, offset partially by a favorable insurance recovery. In addition, stock option expense contributed $2.4 million of the year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A and foreign exchange had a favorable impact of $1.1 million to the year-over-year change in SG&amp;A expenses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development expenses increased $17.5 million, or 64.9%, in 2006 compared to 2005. As a percentage of revenues, R&amp;D expenses amounted to 6.8% in 2006 compared to 4.9% in 2005. The increase in R&amp;D is due almost exclusively to Pharmaceutical's new product development spending. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset impairments and other amounted to a net $8.3 million gain in 2006 compared to a loss in 2005 of $1.2 million. The gain in 2006 primarily consists of a net curtailment gain of $7.5 million from the freezing of the Norwegian and U.S. pension plans. Also included in 2006 results was a gain of $1.9 million realized from a contractual settlement related to an AH business disposed in 2004, partially offset by a charge of $1.1 million related to a prior year contract dispute. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes: </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's effective tax rate ("ETR") is dependent on many factors including: a.) the impact of enacted tax laws in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; b.) the amount of earnings by jurisdiction, due to varying tax rates in each country; c.) the Company's ability to utilize various tax credits; and d.) the estimates of valuation allowances necessary to value deferred tax assets. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $32.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 35.2%. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income taxes for 2005 amounted to a benefit of $18.4 million compared to a pre-tax income of $43.8 million. This benefit was derived from the reversal of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets of $52.1 million, partially offset by income taxes of $28.6 million related to the repatriation of earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discontinued Operations:</P>

The net cash proceeds from this sale were used to repay all of the Company's outstanding debt, which amounted to $416.7 million at December 31, 2005. On March 31, 2006, the Company sold ParMed for cash in the amount of $40.1 million.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Net income from discontinued operations in 2006 include only the results of operations of ParMed for the three months ended March 31, 2006, prior to its sale on March 31, 2006.</P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inflation</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of inflation on the Company's operations during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not significant.</P>
<B><U><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. All professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 2007 have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Company has chosen to highlight certain policies, which include estimates that it considers critical to the operations of the business and its consolidated financial statements:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Revenue Recognition</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers. The Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment. Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenues from the launch of new and significantly unique products, for which the Company is unable to develop the requisite historical data on which to base estimates of returns, due to the uniqueness of the therapeutic area or delivery technology, as compared to other products in the Company's portfolio and in the industry, may be deferred until such time that a reliable estimate can be determined and when the product has achieved market acceptance, which is typically based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained during the period following launch.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Company's Pharmaceuticals and AH businesses, sales to certain customers require that the business remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates, discounts, promotional allowances, and other managed-care allowances. In addition, sales are generally made with limited right of return under certain circumstances.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provisions for these discounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a reduction of total revenues and amounted to $64.1 million and $47.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accruals related to these provisions are reflected on the balance sheet and classified as either a direct reduction of accounts receivable or, to the extent that amounts are due to entities other than customers, as accrued expenses. The reserve balances related to these provisions included in Accounts receivable, net amounted to $11.5 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amounts included in Accrued expenses amounted to $19.6 million and $17.6 million, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The most significant of these reserves relates to Medicaid accruals that are recorded as accrued expenses and estimated based upon experience within each state and information obtained from wholesalers regarding inventory levels. In t
he case of Medicaid accruals and all other reserves for discounts, the Company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these deductions from revenue by comparison of estimated amounts to actual experience. Operating results in 2007 and 2006 were favorably impacted by $2.0 million and $0.7 million in adjustments to prior year reserve balances, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The values assigned to goodwill and intangibles, as well as their related useful lives, are subject to judgment and estimation by the Company. In 2002, upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill and periodically reviews goodwill for impairment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations. These allocations, including an assessment of estimated useful lives, have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies. Valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets, while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset, including historical cash flows.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Asset Impairments</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets, including plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred, based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. If the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Goodwill is reviewed periodically for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the Company, including the determination of an event indicating impairment; the future cash flows to be generated by the asset, including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action; the risk associated with those cash flows; and the Company's cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Research and Development ("R&amp;D"), Including In-Process R&amp;D ("IPR&amp;D")</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to completed acquisitions, acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility, signified by FDA or comparable regulatory body approval, are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits. Estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&amp;D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Inventories</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventories determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval. The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained or the inventory's cost will not be recoverable based on other factors. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employee Benefit Plans</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has two primary defined benefit pension plans, one in the U.S. and one in Norway. Effective December 31, 2006, the Company froze these two pension plans; replacing both with enhanced defined contribution plans. In connection with the freezing of these plans, the Company recorded net pre-tax curtailment and settlement gains, net of special termination benefits, of $7.5 million in 2006.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirement, post-employment and health care benefits. The Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates, and health care cost and trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates, changes in historical experience, and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. Gains and losses arising from changes in assumptions are amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries. In determining pension costs for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, the Company used a discount rate of 6.00% in 2007, 5.75% in 2006, and 6.0
0% in 2005; and an assumed return on plan assets of 8.00% in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The Company used an assumed rate of compensation increases of 4.5% for both 2006 and 2005. The changes in these plan assumptions did not have a significant impact on net earnings for the years involved. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Litigation and Contingencies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and also to certain other contingencies (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 13 to the Financial Statements). The Company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred net of estimated realizable insurance recoveries. Additionally, the Company assesses, in consultation with its counsel, the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case-by-case basis. Reserves are recorded when the Company, in consultation with counsel, determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset. In the event the Company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is recorded. Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization, which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss 
carryforwards. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B><U>Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31, 2007, the Company&nbsp;had $302.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $311.0 of debt outstanding. Interest income earned on investments was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and is included in Interest income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the second quarter of 2007, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. that provided a maximum of $10.6 million of loans to certain of the Company's entities in The People's Republic of China (the "China Credit Facility"). The amount of the China Credit Facility was subsequently increased to $21.6 million during the fourth quarter 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding borrowings under the China Credit Facility were $10.6 million and are classified within Short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest expense associated with the China Credit Facility is calculated based on the amount borrowed, and amounted to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The effective interest rate on the China Credit Facility for year ended December 31, 2007, was 6.0%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In March 2007, the Company issued $300 million of Convertible Senior Notes, due March 2027. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting expenses, were $292.8 million. The net proceeds are being used to fund business development transactions and for general corporate purposes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $47.0 million including the $60.0 million payment to IDEA, compared to $42.9 million provided from operations in 2006. During 2007, the Company received net cash tax refunds of $1.9 million versus $64.4 million paid for cash taxes in 2006, which is included in the overall change. Included in the $64.4 million paid for cash taxes in 2006, was approximately $30 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and additional cash payments of approximately $25 million related to the settlement of accrued tax expenses associated with the Generics Business disposition. Cash provided by operating activities in 2006 includes the cash flows of discontinued operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $100.3 million related to the Company's licensing agreement with IBSA and $6.9 million related to the Company's acquisitions in China (See Notes 5 and 4, respectively). Cash flow used in investing activities also included capital expenditures of $60.5 million, of which approximately $9.6 million related to the manufacturing alliance with Hisun (See Note 4). Cash provided by investing activities for 2006 included the proceeds from the sale of ParMed of $40.1 million and, in 2005, the net proceeds from the sale of the Generics Business of $804.4 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $36.2 million in 2006 and $38.9 million in 2005. Cash from investing activities includes cash flows of discontinued operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cash flow provided by financing activities in 2007 was $310.4 million compared with a use of $732.8 million in 2006. Cash flow from financing activities in 2007 includes the net proceeds of $292.8 million from the issuance of $300 million in Convertible Senior Notes and net proceeds of $10.7 million primarily from a revolving credit facility for the Company's entities in The People's Republic of China. The use of funds in 2006 included $436.3 million related to the repayment of debt, including a call premium of $18.9 million. Also included in the use of funds in 2006 was the repurchase of all the Class B shares for $307.4 million. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Working capital, including cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2007, was $383.1 million compared to working capital of $198.0 million at December 31, 2006. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the $292.8 million of cash received in conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition to the increase in cash, the increase in current assets reflects increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels as a result of higher volumes and supply chain planning in anticipation of expected increased market demand for certain products. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the terms of certain business and product acquisition and licensing agreements, the Company may be required to make additional payments in future years upon the occurrence of specified events. Additionally, the Company has a number of conditional supply agreements which obligate the Company to purchase products or services from vendors based on Company forecasts which are updated on a regular basis and at prices subject to negotiation and change. Certain of the supply agreements may require minimum payments under certain circumstances if minimum quantities are not purchased. See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional information.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company's risk management practice includes the selective use, on a limited basis, of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Such instruments are used for purposes other than trading.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in U.S. Dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies. The Company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>At December 31, 2007, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in Euros, Danish Krones, Hungarian Forints, Norwegian Kroner, Swiss Francs, Swedish Krona and U.S. Dollars with a notional amount of $221.0 million. The fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material. All contracts expire in the first quarter of 2008. The cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non-functional currency transactions. The change in notional value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $23.0 million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable. Such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest Rate Risk</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Alpharma's interest rate risk relates primarily to the asset-based $75 million Senior Secured Credit Facility, which has variable interest rates which reset on a periodic basis. At December 31, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. In addition, the Company has a $21.6 million credit facility in China that is made available in local currency to the Company's Chinese subsidiaries. The facility has a variable interest rate (6.8% as of December 31, 2007), which resets on a periodic basis. At December 31, 2007, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">$10.6 million</FONT> was drawn under the credit facility in China.</P>
<P>The Company also has a $300.0 million Convertible Note which has a fixed interest rate of 2.125%.</P></DIR>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The disclosure controls and procedures involve participation by various individuals in the Company having access to material information relating to the operations of the Company. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, 
the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's CEO and CFO completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 as of December 31, 2007. Based on this evaluation, they concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company,</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the Company, and </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, utilizing the criteria described in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). The objective of this assessment was to determine whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. Based on that assessment the Company believes that, at December 31, 2007, its internal control over financial reporting was effective.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended December 31, 2007, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</P>

Executive Bonus Plan. Each such Named Executive Officer can receive more or less than his or her target bonus (from 0% to 200% of said target bonus) based upon the Company's ability to achieve certain operating income, cash flow and revenue growth targets for 2008. In addition, for Named Executive Officers who are responsible for a specific business segment of the Company, a portion of his or her bonus will depend on that business segment's ability to achieve certain income, cash flow and revenue targets for 2008.&nbsp; The target bonus level for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2008 fiscal year is 100% and for the other Named Executive Officers for the 2008 fiscal year is 50%.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alpharma Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alpharma, Inc. at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As described in Note 17, in 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," effective January 1, 2007.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Alpharma Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have audited Alpharma Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Alpharma Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
 of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, Alpharma Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Alpharma Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion. </P>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>The Company</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpharma Inc. and Subsidiaries, (the "Company") is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
On December 28, 2006, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Class B common stock from A.L. Industrier ASA ("Industrier"). Including related fees, the cost of repurchasing the B shares was $307,397. Through its ownership of the Class B common stock, Industier had voting power that provided it with effective control of the Company. Following the Class B share repurchase, control of the Company rests in the holders of the Class A shares acting by the majority applicable under Delaware law and Company's charter documents (See Note 18).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's businesses are organized in three reportable segments, as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Animal Health ("AH")</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products, a pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN and a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product sold in the U.S., as of January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR Patch. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API develops, manufactures and markets a range of antibiotic fermentation-based, and a chemically synthesized, active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of finished dose pharmaceutical products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH develops, registers, manufactures and markets medicated feed additives ("MFAs") and water soluble therapeutics for production animals, which include poultry, cattle and swine. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 6, 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients business to certain investment funds managed by 3i, a global private equity and venture capital company (See Note 25).</P>
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and other matters</P>
</U><P><BR>
Basis of Presentation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations have been presented for all periods to classify as Discontinued Operations, the Company's worldwide human generics pharmaceutical business (the "Generics Business", which was sold on December 19, 2005), and ParMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("ParMed", which the Company sold on March 31, 2006) (See Note 3). Consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows", the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have not been reclassified for activities of the discontinued operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has not reported its API business as an asset held for sale, or as discontinued operations, at December 31, 2007, as the applicable criteria in SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", were not met as of December 31, 2007 (See Note 25). </P>
<P>Principles of consolidation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and international subsidiaries. The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.</P>
<P><BR>
Use of estimates:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Cash equivalents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash equivalents include institutional money market funds and bank time deposits. All investments are highly liquid and, therefore, are available to the Company on a daily basis. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on historical write-off experience, current economic conditions and a review of individual accounts. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. A specific reserve for individual accounts is recorded when the Company becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables are further adjusted. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. There is no off-balance-sheet cred
it exposure related to the Company's customers. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Inventories:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for all inventories. The determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors, including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices. Inventory determined to be damaged, obsolete, or otherwise unsaleable is written down to its net realizable value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also purchases raw materials, and manufactures finished goods, for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval. The Company reviews these inventories on a case-by-case basis, and records a write-down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained or the cost of the inventory will not be recoverable based on other factors. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Property, plant and equipment:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss included in net income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciable assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. A loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the assets. Fair value is determined based upon a market quote, if available, or is based on valuation techniques.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest is capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of major construction and software development projects. No interest was capitalized in 2007 and 2006, and in 2005, $610 of interest costs were capitalized.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, which are generally as follows:</P>

<P>Goodwill and Intangible Assets:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company follows SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" for all goodwill and intangibles acquired in business combinations. Under SFAS No. 142, all goodwill and certain intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized; but, are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite useful lives, such as license and distribution rights, patents and trademarks, are amortized using the straight-line or an activity-based (units of volume) method, over their useful lives, generally 5-20 years, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." See Note 10 for additional detail relating to the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Foreign currency translation and transactions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using average rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in income. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. </P>
<P><BR>
Derivative Instruments:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company carries its derivative instruments at their fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts in current period earnings. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company selectively enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell certain cash flows in non-functional currencies and hedge certain firm commitments due in foreign currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts, other than hedges of firm commitments, are accounted for as foreign currency transactions and gains or losses are included in income.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Revenue Recognition:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers. The Company's subsidiaries have terms of FOB shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment. Additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product, for which the Company is unable to develop the requisite historical data on which to base estimates of returns, due to the uniqueness of the therapeutic area or delivery technology as compared to other products in the Company's portfolio and in the industry, will be deferred until such time that a reliable estimate can be determined and all of the conditions above are met and when the product has achieved market acceptance, which is typically based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained during the period following launch. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stock-based Compensation:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, "Share-Based Payments," effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation in net earnings. Stock-based compensation consists primarily of incentive stock options and restricted stock. Effective in March 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the award of equity-related incentives under the Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, which included a performance-based incentive; "Performance Based Restricted Class A Common Stock" ("Performance-Based Restricted Stock") awards. The Performance-Based Restricted Stock units awarded in March and May 2007, vest on the date the Company files its Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. Any Performance-Based Restricted Stock units awarded after May 2007 will vest on the later of the third anniversary of the grant date or the date the Company files its Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. Eff
ective in January 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved amendments to the Performance-Based Restricted Stock award agreements entered into in 2007 such that the target number of units will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and a new grant equal to an incremental number of units was granted in January 2008 which will vest in 2010. The fair value of the performance-based restricted stock is being amortized to expense over the requisite service period. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock at the dates of grant. Generally, stock options granted to employees vest in 25% increments each year and are fully vested four years from the grant date and have a term of 10&nbsp;years. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock options under the intrinsic value method described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations. The Company, applying the intrinsic value method, did not record stock-based compensation cost in net income because the exercise price of its stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123, will be recognized in net earnings in the periods after the date of adoption. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options 
for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the amounts of $1,777 and $2,383, respectively. The Company also recorded tax-related benefits for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the amounts of $569 and $792, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS 123R requires the Company to present pro forma information for periods prior to adoption, as if it had accounted for all stock-based compensation under the fair value method of that Statement. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R to its stock-based compensation for the period indicated: </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities between amounts recorded for financial statement and tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method as required by SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes." A valuation allowance is established, as needed, to reduce the carrying value of net deferred tax assets, if realization of such assets is not considered to be "more likely than not."</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," requires segment information to be prepared using the "management" approach. The management approach is based on the method that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

Shipping Costs:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for shipping costs in selling, general and administrative expenses for purposes of classification within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. These costs for continuing operations were approximately $17,000, $15,000, and $13,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and Development:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternate future uses are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with agreements with third parties are generally expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval, absent any alternative future uses. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are generally capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Software and Development Costs:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company capitalized purchased software from third-party vendors and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization begins as portions of the projects are completed, ready for their intended purpose and placed in service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the projects which are estimated to be five to seven years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized software costs related to the Company's Enterprise Resource Planning System, net of amortization, through December 31, 2007 and 2006 amounted to approximately $4,403 and $7,404, respectively, and are included in other assets. </P>

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) number APB 14-a, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)", is expected to be discussed by the FASB in the first quarter of 2008. If adopted, it will be effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, with retrospective application. Early adoption is not permitted. FSP APB 14-a specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If FSP number APB 14-a is adopted, the Company's accounting for its $300,000 Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") will be impacted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact; but estimates that implementation would result in an approximately $80,000 reduction in its March 31, 2007 Note balance outstanding, with a corresponding increase in equity. The Company also estimates that if adopted, the 2008 and retrospective 2007 application of the standard would result in increased interest expense of approximately $10,000 and $7,000 for the years ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States and will be applied to existing accounting and disclosure requirements in GAAP that are based on fair value. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes a "market-based" as opposed to an "entity-specific" measurement perspective, establishes a hierarchy of fair value measurement methods and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements including methods and assumptions and the impact on earnings. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of SFAS 157, the proposed effective date of which is fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 related to non-financial assets and liabilities, and November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, and 
for interim periods within those years. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 provides an option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value primarily to reduce the complexity and level of volatility in the accounting for financial instruments resulting from measuring related financial assets and liabilities differently under existing U.S. GAAP. SFAS 159 is effective January 1, 2008. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of SFAS 159. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users, all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009, thus the Company cannot assess the impact the standard will have on its financial statements at this time. Early application of SFAS 141R is prohibited.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 requires all entities to report noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements, and eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions. SFAS 160 is effective January 1, 2009, and early adoption is prohibited. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of SFAS 160.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. <U>Acquisitions and Alliances</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2007, the Company announced it had completed its previously disclosed alliance agreements with Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd ("Hisun") that, over the next several years, will enable the Company's Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API") business to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity for one of its major active pharmaceutical ingredients, vancomycin, subject to the receipt of required FDA and European regulatory approvals. Since 2006, Alpharma has purchased vancomycin from Hisun pending the completion of the construction and regulatory approval process of a new vancomycin manufacturing facility in Taizhou, China. The new facility, which will be owned and operated by Alpharma, is expected to be completed in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company invested approximately $9,600 in capital expenditures at the Taizhou facility. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2007, the Company acquired certain assets of Yantai JinHai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. ("Yantai") located in Yantai City, Shandong Province. The Company's Animal Health ("AH") business plans to utilize this site to blend products it currently produces in its U.S. facilities and sells in Asia. The purchase of these assets is expected to provide supply chain flexibility, and expand the Company's regulatory base in Asia. The acquisition includes product registrations that the Company plans to utilize to expand its Asian product offering. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2007, the Company acquired assets of Shenzhou Tongde Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd ("Tongde") in Shenzhou City, China. Tongde was a supplier to the Company's AH business and manufactures and markets zinc bacitracin. Tongde's 2006 annual sales approximated $5,000. Following the acquisition, the Company continues to support the current customer base of Tongde while also exporting the product to other markets. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase price for the acquisitions of Yantai and Tongde totaled approximately $6,900. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>License and Collaboration Agreements</U> </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDEA AG ("IDEA")</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2007, the Company's affiliate, Alpharma Ireland Limited ("Alpharma Ireland"), closed on an agreement with IDEA AG ("IDEA"), a privately held biopharmaceutical company with headquarters in Munich, Germany. The agreement provides the Company with an exclusive license to the United States rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ("NSAID") in Phase III clinical development. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the license agreement between Alpharma Ireland and IDEA include a $60,000 payment that was made in connection with the October 2007 closing. The agreement also includes three clinical and regulatory progress milestone payments ("progress milestone payments") totaling $77,000 that are expected to be paid over the next 12 to 18 months, based upon IDEA's achievement of contractually-specified conditions. An additional milestone payment of either $45,000 or $65,000 is conditioned on U.S. product approval (with the higher amount dependent upon the achievement of a specified end point in one of the clinical trials). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDEA has agreed to pay the costs of specified studies it is undertaking to obtain FDA approval of ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel. Under the terms of the agreement, IDEA has the option, during the period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009, to receive a loan of up to $20,000 from Alpharma Ireland in support of its clinical development program. Any outstanding loan amounts will become due and payable by IDEA immediately upon its receipt of both the first and second progress milestone payments, totaling $37,000. All outstanding loan amounts will bear interest at a rate of one month LIBOR plus 1.5% and, if not due earlier, will be due on December 31, 2009. There are no loan amounts currently outstanding. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the agreement also include the issuance of two series of stock warrants to IDEA for the purchase of shares of the Company's Class A common stock. Both series vest only upon FDA approval of the product in the United States. The amount and pricing of the Phase III Milestone ("Series A") warrants are tied to positive phase III results, and the Form of Approval ("Series B") warrants are tied to FDA approval. The strike price for the Series A warrants will be determined by applying a 50% premium to the 30 day average stock price immediately preceding the announcement of positive phase III results; with a minimum exercise price per share of $22.50. The strike price for the Series B warrants will be determined by applying a 25% premium to the 30 day average stock price immediately following the FDA approval date; with a minimum exercise price per share of $18.75. For both the Series A and B warrants, the number of shares eligible to be purchased under th
e warrants will be determined by dividing $50,000 for each series by the respective strike price for each series. Upon vesting at the time of FDA approval, both series of warrants have a term of approximately five years, with a limit of ten years from the date of entering into the agreement. The fair value of these warrants will be recognized upon FDA approval. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement includes commitments whereby the Company is required to spend pre-determined minimum amounts for the commercialization of the product, (including selling, marketing and medical educational expenses) during the first four years following the product's launch. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement also includes the future payment of royalties based on annual net sales applied to a tiered structure. The Company's royalty payments to IDEA will be calculated starting at 5% of annual net sales of the product up to a maximum royalty rate of 24%, based upon contractually agreed annual net sales levels. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The license agreement expires upon the later of the expiration of all U.S. patent rights licensed by IDEA to Alpharma Ireland or 2029.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the closing in October 2007, Alpharma Ireland paid $60,000 to IDEA, which was recorded as research and development expense, and issued both series of stock warrants. In addition, during the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Company recorded approximately $2,300 in transaction-related costs. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Institut Biochimique SA ("IBSA") </P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2007, the Company's affiliate, Alpharma Pharmaceuticals LLC, closed on two license and distribution agreements (the "IBSA License and Distribution Agreements") with IBSA, a privately-owned, global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland. The agreements have a ten year term, with automatic renewal options, and provide the Company with the exclusive license and distribution rights to market: 1) the FLECTOR Patch and 2) TIROSINT (synthetic levothyroxine sodium) gel capsules, in the United States. The patent-protected FLECTOR Patch, which was approved in the U.S. by the FDA in January 2007, delivers the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of patent-protected diclofenac epolamine through a topical patch, and is indicated for the topical treatment of acute pain due to minor strains, sprains, and contusions. TIROSINT was approved by the FDA in October 2006 and is indicated for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the IBSA License and Distribution Agreements called for a total of $100,000 in upfront payments upon closing. The Company paid IBSA $5,000 of this amount during the second quarter of 2007 and the remaining $95,000 at closing, in September 2007. In addition, on October 3, 2007, in accordance with the terms of the FLECTOR Patch agreement, the Company issued to IBSA a warrant for the purchase of up to one million shares of the Company's Class A common stock. These stock warrants were issued with a $35 strike price and a three-year term, through August 16, 2010. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the IBSA License and Distribution Agreements for TIROSINT, as amended, the Company must undertake to launch the TIROSINT gel capsules by January 2009. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial supply of the FLECTOR Patch will be provided by IBSA, at contractually determined prices, through a manufacturing agreement IBSA has with a Japanese supplier. It is expected that IBSA will supply the TIROSINT product, at contractually determined prices, from its own manufacturing facility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IBSA License and Distribution Agreements include certain annual minimum purchase commitments for both the FLECTOR Patch and TIROSINT gel capsules. The minimum commitments increase each year over the first three years from product launch and remain at year three levels (or, in the case of TIROSINT agreement, at the slightly reduced year four level) for the remaining years of the agreements. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $100,000 cash payments to IBSA and transaction-related costs have been capitalized as an addition to intangible assets as of September 30, 2007. The Black-Scholes value of the stock warrants ($1,780) was capitalized in the fourth quarter of 2007 as an addition to intangible assets. These intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated commercial lives of the products, using a sales-activity-based methodology. </P>

<FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>The amount of dilution attributable to stock options, determined by the treasury stock method, depends on the average market price of the Company's common stock for each period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, stock options to purchase 783, 641, and 1,355 shares, respectively, were not included in the diluted EPS calculation because the option price was greater than the average market price of the Class A common shares. </P>

The effects of the 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 (the "05 Notes") were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2005 because the result was anti-dilutive. On April 1, 2005, the Company repaid the 05 Notes ($9,752 as of March 31, 2005). In addition, the effects of the 3% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "06 Notes") were not included in the calculation of the diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2005 because the result was anti-dilutive.

In addition, stock warrants issued to IBSA and the effects of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the "Notes") were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2007 because the results were anti-dilutive.</P>

Additions to goodwill relate to two AH acquisitions in China during 2007 (See Note 4).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In May 2006, the Company's API business acquired the remaining 80% of Nippon Dumex for approximately $1,089 resulting in goodwill of $537.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As required, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company performed the required annual test for impairment. The assessment was made in conjunction with the budgeting and long-range planning by each segment. The assessment utilized forecasted cash flows discounted at a rate of 10.5%. </P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Short-term debt amounted to $11,032 at December 31, 2007, primarily consisting of outstanding borrowings under the Chinese Credit Facility. </P>
<P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Long-Term Debt</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2007, the Company issued $300,000 of Convertible Senior Notes, due March 15, 2027 ("the Notes"), with interest payable semi-annually, in arrears, on March 15 and September 15, at a rate of 2.125% per annum. The Notes are unsecured obligations and rank subordinate to all future secured debt and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries. The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 30.6725 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, subject to adjustment. The conversion rate is based on an initial conversion price of $32.60 per share. The maximum number of shares a note-holder may receive as a result of such adjustments is 41.40. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option commencing on or after March 15, 2014. The holders have one day put rights on March 15, 2014, 2017 and 2022, to require the Company to repurchase the Notes at 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unp
aid interest. Beginning with the period commencing on March 20, 2014 and during any six-month interest period thereafter, the Company will pay contingent interest if the average trading price of the Notes is above a specified level. The net proceeds from the issuance were $292,772 after deducting expenses, and are being used to fund business development transactions and for general corporate purposes. Deferred loan costs in the amount of $7,228 are being amortized over seven years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2007 Long-term debt outstanding was $300,000. There was no Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On October 26, 2005, the Company entered into a five-year, Senior Secured Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A. consisting of a $175,000 asset-based, revolving loan facility and a $35,000 term loan. The Company used $119,122 of this facility to repay and retire the 2001 U.S. Bank Credit Facility in October 2005. The Senior Secured Credit facility was subsequently repaid in full in December 2005 with the proceeds from the sale of the Generics business. The Senior Secured Credit Facility was amended and restated on March 10, 2006 reducing the asset-based, revolving loan facility to $75,000 and canceling the term loan. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Secured Credit Facility, which was amended and restated on March 10, 2006, is secured by the accounts receivable, inventory and certain fixed assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The amount that is available to the Company to be borrowed is determined monthly based upon the calculation of a Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under this Facility. The interest rate that the Company would pay on outstanding amounts is based upon a spread over LIBOR or Base Rate. The spread ranges between 1.25% to 2.00% over LIBOR and 0% to 0.50% over the Base Rate. The determination of the spread is based upon the amount of availability under the facility with a lower spread payable based upon greater availability. As long as the Company does not have average availability less than $15,000 over a consecutive 10 day period, there are no financial covenants. In the event that the Company were to breach the avail
ability threshold, the Company would be subject to a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1:1.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.<B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><U>Contingent Liabilities and Litigation </P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, of a nature considered normal to its business. It is the Company's policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of the Company, although the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with the following legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.</P>
<B><P>Chicken Litter Litigation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is one of multiple defendants that have been named in several lawsuits which allege that one of its AH products causes chickens to produce manure that contains an arsenical compound which, when used as agricultural fertilizer by chicken farmers, degrades into inorganic arsenic and causes a variety of diseases in the plaintiffs (who allegedly live in close proximity to such farm fields). The Company has provided notice to its insurance carriers and its primary insurance carriers have responded by accepting their obligations to defend or pay the Company's defense costs, subject to reservation of rights to later reject coverage for these lawsuits. In addition, one of the Company's carriers has filed a Declaratory Judgment action in state court in which it has sought a ruling concerning the allocation of its coverage obligations to the Company among the Company's several insurance carriers and, to the extent the Company does not have full insurance
 coverage, to the Company. In addition, this Declaratory Judgment action requests that the Court rule that certain of the carrier's policies provide no coverage because certain policy exclusions allegedly operate to limit its coverage obligations under said policies. Furthermore, the Company's insurance carriers may take the position that some, or all, of the applicable insurance policies contain certain provisions that could limit coverage for future product liability claims arising in connection with such AH product sold on and after December 16, 2003. &#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the potential for personal injury damages to the approximately 152 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are asking for punitive damages and requesting that the Company be enjoined from the future sale of the product at issue. In September 2006, in the first trial, which was brought by two plaintiffs, the Circuit Court of Washington County, Arkansas, Second Division, entered a jury verdict in favor of the Company. The plaintiffs have appealed the verdict. The court has ruled that future trials are on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. While the Company can give no assurance of the outcome of these matters, it believes that it will be able to continue to present credible scientific evidence that its product is not the cause of any injuries the plaintiffs may have suffered. There is also the possibility of an adverse customer reaction to the allegations in these lawsuits, as well as additional lawsuits in other jurisdictions where the product has been s
old. Worldwide sales of this product were approximately $23,100 in 2005, $22,200 in 2006 and $20,400 in 2007.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brazilian Tax Claims</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the subject of tax claims by the Brazilian authorities relating to sales and import taxes which aggregate approximately $10,000. The claims relate to the operations of the Company's AH business in Brazil since 1999. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its position against these claims.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Environmental Regulations</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, the environmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Copenhagen API manufacturing facility gave the Company notice of revised waste discharge levels. The Company believes it has taken the actions necessary to comply with the requirements, including certain plant alterations and modifications at a cost not material to the Company. The environmental authorities have not confirmed whether the Company's actions are in compliance with the requirements outlined in the notice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2007, the Company paid a reduced criminal fine of $780 in settlement of specified past accidental discharge activities at the Oslo API facility. Separately, in September 2007, the environmental authority having jurisdiction over the Oslo API plant of the Company gave the Company notice that it believes certain ordinary course discharge activities at the facility have not been in compliance with discharge levels permitted under the Company's permit during that period. The Company has responded to the authority's request for further information and indicated it believes it has been in compliance with its permit with respect to its ordinary course discharge activities. The environmental authority has procured additional testing and expert opinions that the Company believes support its position that such ordinary course discharge levels are in compliance with the Company's permit. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations could result in further criminal or civil actions affecting production at these facilities which could be materially adverse to the Company.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information Request</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 28, 2007, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain documents relating to the marketing of KADIAN. The subpoena did not disclose any allegations underlying this request. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FLSA Class Action</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purported class action lawsuit has been filed with the United States District Court in New Jersey. The complaint alleges that, among other things, (i) over 200 of the Company's U.S. based Pharmaceuticals sales representatives were denied overtime pay, in violation of state and federal labor laws, by being paid for forty hour weeks even though they worked in excess of fifty-five hours per week, and (ii) that the Company violated federal record-keeping requirements. Based upon the facts as presently known, the Company does not believe that it is likely that the class action will result in liability which would be material to the Company's financial position. <FONT FACE="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its positions in these lawsuits. Numerous other pharmaceutical companies are defendants in similar lawsuits. </P>
</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Average Wholesale Price Litigation </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company, and in certain instances, Pharmaceuticals, are defendants in various lawsuits in state, city and county courts, based upon allegations that fraudulent Average Wholesale Prices ("AWP") were reported primarily in connection with KADIAN for varying numbers of years under governmental Medicaid reimbursement programs. The plaintiffs in these cases include state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drug at issue based on AWP. These lawsuits vary with respect to the particular causes of action and relief sought. The relief sought in these lawsuits includes statutory causes of action including civil penalties and treble damages, common law causes of action, and declaratory and injunctive relief, including, in certain lawsuits, disgorgement of profits. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend its positions in these lawsuits. Numerous other pharmaceutical companies are defendants in similar law
suits. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Commercial Disputes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is engaged in disputes with several suppliers, customers and distributors regarding certain obligations with respect to contracts under which the Company obtains raw materials and under which the Company supplies finished products. Given the fact that these disputes will most likely be resolved over more than one year, management does not believe that the disputes in the aggregate will be material to the Company's financial position.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains two qualified noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering its U.S. (domestic) employees: the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan which was frozen effective December 31, 2006 and the previously frozen Faulding Inc. Pension Plan. The benefits payable from these plans are based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five years compensation during the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Ideally, the Plan assets will approximate the accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO"). The plan assets are held by two custodians and managed by two investment managers. Plan assets are invested in equities, government securities and bonds. In addition, the Company has unfunded supplemental executive pension plans providing additional benefits to certain employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an unfunded postretirement medical and nominal life insurance plan ("postretirement benefits") covering certain domestic employees who were eligible as of January 1, 1993. The plan has not been extended to any additional employees. Retired eligible employees are required to make premium contributions for coverage as if they were active employees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension plans and other postretirement plans.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stock Options</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to May 19, 2003, the Company granted options to key employees to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock under the 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan"). The maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Plan was 8,000,000. In addition, the Company had a Non-Employee Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan") which provided for the issue of up to 350,000 shares of Class A Common stock. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan could not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Options granted expired from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options were exercisable in annual installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. The Plan permitted a cash appreciation right to be granted to certain employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 19, 2003, the Company's stockholders approved the Alpharma Inc. 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Incentive Compensation Plan"). The Incentive Compensation Plan permits stock option grants, stock appreciation rights grants ("SARs"), annual incentive awards, stock grants, restricted stock grants, restricted stock unit grants, performance stock grants, performance units grants, and cash awards. Upon adoption of the Incentive Compensation Plan, no additional options were granted under the previously existing plans (Alpharma Inc. 1997 Stock Option and Appreciation Right Plan and the Alpharma Inc. Non-Employee Director Option Plan) and all shares reserved under these existing plans were returned to the Company's supply of authorized but unissued shares, not reserved for any purpose, although outstanding options granted pursuant to the previously existing plans remained outstanding. Upon adoption, the maximum number of Class A shares available for grant under the Incenti
ve Compensation Plan was 4,750,000 and the number of shares that were permitted to be issued for Awards other than stock options or SARS (both with a grant price equal to at least fair market value at date of grant), were not to exceed a total of 2,000,000 shares. Options granted expire from three to ten years after the grant date. Generally, options are exercisable in annual installments of 25% beginning one year from date of grant. If an option holder ceases to be an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason prior to vesting of any options, all options which are not vested at the date of termination are forfeited. As of December 31, 2007, there were 2,025,907 shares available for future grant under the Incentive Compensation Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock at the dates of grant. Generally, stock options granted to employees vest in 25% increments each year and are fully vested four years from the grant date and have a term of 10&nbsp;years. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. Included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the statement of operations, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the amounts of $1,777 and $2,383, respectively. The Company also recorded tax-related benefits for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the amounts of $569 and $792, respectively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company estimated the fair value, as of the date of grant, of options outstanding in the plan using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following assumptions:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Black-Scholes assumptions for stock options include the expected volatility of the Company's stock and the expected term of the options. The Company calculates volatility using a weighted average of historical share price volatility. The Company estimates expected life for options by calculating the average of the vesting and expiration periods. The changes in assumptions in 2007 did not have a material effect on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, and reflect the changing profile of the Company since the divestiture of the Generics Business.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The risk-free interest rates for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were based upon U.S. Treasury instrument rates with maturity approximating the expected term. The weighted average interest rates in 2007, 2006 and 2005 amounted to 4.5%, 4.7%, and 3.8%, respectively. The weighted average fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $9.41, $13.81, and $6.33, respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Restricted Stock and Performance Based Restricted Stock</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for restricted stock is recorded based on the market value of the stock on the grant date. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company capitalized the full amount of the restricted stock as unearned compensation, with an offset to additional paid-in capital. Effective January 1, 2006, in accordance with SFAS 123R, the Company reversed the unamortized balance of $5,395 against additional paid-in capital. The fair value of restricted stock is amortized to expense over the requisite service period. Amortization expense related to restricted stock amounted to $3,848, $2,461 and $4,320 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan also provided for the issuance of performance units that were valued based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return as compared to a market index of peer companies and the satisfaction of a free cash flow threshold. Each performance unit had a potential value between zero and $200. In conjunction with the sale of the Generics Business, which made the peer group comparison no longer relevant, the Company froze the performance unit plan effective December 18, 2005. The Company fixed the final payout for each outstanding performance unit at $100 per unit. The value of the performance units, net of forfeitures, was paid out at the end of the plan's original three year vesting period, December 31, 2007. The total value of performance units outstanding at December 31, 2007 was $2,112, and is fully accrued at December 31, 2007.

<P>* Includes valuation allowance on NOLs and tax credits, as shown in the table below, and other deferred assets.</P>
<P>The year-over-year increase in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance is attributable to the change in and establishment of foreign valuation allowances, partially offset by valuation allowance decreases, primarily associated with the expiration of state net operating losses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net deferred tax assets include $1,034 and $1,382 for unrecognized loss on pensions, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in other comprehensive income was a tax benefit of $348 that the Company recognized in 2007. Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has state loss carryforwards in several states which are available to offset future taxable income. The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset related to these loss carryforwards. Based on analysis of current information, which indicates that it is not more likely than not that the state losses will be realized, a valuation allowance of $19,667 has been established for the tax benefits of these loss carryforwards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gross short-term deferred tax liabilities of $2,800 and $3,334 are included within accrued and deferred income taxes, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Long-term deferred income tax liabilities amount to $27,358 and $27,885 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Short-term deferred tax assets are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and, net of valuation allowances, amount to $10,122 and $18,925 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other assets and deferred charges include long-term deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, of $40,397 and $48,817 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Included in the foreign net operating losses is a $60,000 upfront payment made in 2007 from Alpharma Ireland in connection with its license agreement with IDEA AG. The Company recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately $7,600 in connection with losses (principally related to this upfront payment) incurred by Alpharma Ireland in 2007. As Alpharma Ireland is a start-up operation for a product in development, the Company has no basis to conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized and, accordingly has provided a full valuation allowance for those assets.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") provided for a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by allowing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In 2005, the Company repatriated foreign earnings under the Act. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes approximately $28,600 related to this repatriation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2007 the Company had unremitted earnings of approximately $40,000 in foreign subsidiaries for which no provisions for U.S. taxes have been made, because it is expected that these earnings will be reinvested indefinitely.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company and some of its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2004. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2003 for state and local income taxes, and tax years before 2002 for non-U.S. income taxes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes", on January 1, 2007. As a result of its initial adoption of FIN 48, the Company recognized $4,712 as an increase in its accumulated deficit and a non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007.

23.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Information Concerning Business Segments and Geographic Operations</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The Company's businesses are organized in three reportable segments, as follows: <A NAME="OLE_LINK1">Pharmaceuticals</A> ("Pharmaceuticals"), Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients ("API"), and Animal Health ("AH"). Each business has a segment president who reports to the CEO. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of each segment are evaluated based on earnings before interest and taxes (operating income). Unallocated costs include corporate expenses for administration, finance, legal and certain unallocated expenses primarily related to stock-based compensation and other long-term incentive compensation, as well as certain costs related to business development activities and the implementation of a company-wide enterprise resource planning system. Segment data includes immaterial inter-segment revenues which are eliminated in the consolidated accounts. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Geographic revenues represent sales to third parties by country in which the selling legal entity is domiciled. Operating assets directly attributable to business segments are included in identifiable assets (i.e. sum of accounts receivable, inventories, net property, plant and equipment and net intangible assets). Operating assets for Pharmaceuticals do not include manufacturing property, plant and equipment. Cash, prepaid expenses, and other corporate and non-allocated assets are included in unallocated. Discontinued operations include the Generics Business and the ParMed Business. For geographic reporting, long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and net intangibles. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AH revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 include one product that individually accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues; Chlortetracyline ($117,900). Pharmaceuticals revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 are entirely comprised of KADIAN sales, and account for more than 10% of consolidated revenues. One Pharmaceuticals' wholesale customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.</P>

<P>November 9, 2007</P>
<P>Mr. Carl-Aake Carlsson</P>
<P>Batstojordet 93</P>
<P>N-1363 Hovik, Norway</P>
<P>Dear Carl-Aake:</P>
<P>Alpharma AS (the "Company") recognizes you as a valuable member of the team charged with responsibility for completing the sale of all or substantially all of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Business (which consists of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient business segment reported by Alpharma Inc. ("Alpharma") under the Securities Act of 1934, and hereafter called the "API Business "). In order to incentivize you to remain with the Company, and to protect you in the event your employment is terminated, the Company is providing you with the retention and severance benefits set forth in this letter agreement (this "Agreement").</P>
<P>This Agreement will remain in effect until December 12, 2008; <U>provided that</U>, if a Qualifying Transaction (as defined below) occurs prior to such date, it shall remain in effect for two years after such Qualifying Transaction.</P>
<B><U><P>Retention Award </P>
</B></U><P>Without regard to the occurrence of a Qualifying Transaction (as defined below), on the 15<SUP>th</SUP> day of the month following the full execution this letter agreement, you will receive a long-term incentive award in the form of Restricted Stock under the Company's 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "<U>Omnibus Plan</U>") consisting of 10,000 shares of the Alpharma's Class A Common Stock. As you may know, restricted stock is stock that Alpharma holds for you, pending the satisfaction of the restrictions set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement,. At the time that the restrictions set forth in the award agreement lapse, the shares of stock will be "released" to you. You may retain, sell or otherwise dispose of the shares of stock subject to restrictions on the sale of the stock that are imposed by law and Alpharma's normal stock sale "black-out" provisions applicable generally to senior executives. You will be responsible for any taxes or sales costs associated with this awar
d or the sale of the related Alpharma stock. </P>
<P>The Restricted Stock Award Agreement will include a provision providing for 100% vesting of such restricted stock on the third anniversary date of the Grant Date (as defined therein) provided that you are an active employee of the Company on such date. The Award Agreement will also include certain other provisions under which vesting could occur earlier in the event of a Qualifying Transaction. You will have no right to the Restricted Stock unless and until it vests in the manner set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement. All terms of this award are subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement which shall prevail should there be any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Award Agreement.</P>
<B><U><P>Additional Benefits Upon a Qualifying Transaction</P>
</B></U><P>If prior to December 12, 2008, either a (x) a Sale of the API Business (as defined below) or (y) a "Change in Control" of Alpharma under Alpharma's Change in Control Plan occurs while both you are an active employee of the Company and the companies constituting the API Business are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Alpharma (each a "Qualifying Transaction"), you will be entitled to the benefits described below. The benefits provided herein will be in lieu of the benefits set forth in Alpharma's Severance or Change in Control Plans or any employment letter or agreement, including the letter agreement dated December 12, 2005 between the Company and you (the "2005 Letter"), or any other plan or arrangement in existence prior to the date of this Agreement.</P>
<U><P>Transaction Bonus.</P>
</U><P>In recognition of your past and expected efforts in this regard, and in recognition of the fact that a Sale of the API Business could materially change the nature of your continuing responsibilities with the Company, the Company is granting you a Transaction Bonus (as defined below) provided that both of the following conditions are satisfied:</P><DIR>

<P>1.The consummation on or before December 12, 2008 of the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and business of the API Business to any person, entity or group unaffiliated with Alpharma in a transaction that does not result in a "Change in Control" of Alpharma Inc. under the Alpharma Change in Control Plan (a "Sale of the API Business"). For avoidance of doubt, any transaction which results in a "Change in Control" of Alpharma shall not entitle you to a Transaction Bonus but the Sale of the API Business does not, by itself, constitute a "Change in Control" of Alpharma under the Alpharma Change in Control Plan, and </P>
<P>2. You continue to be an employee of the Company or the entity that acquires the Company or the API Business (the "Acquiring Company") until the first to occur of (a) six months after the date of the Sale of the API Business, or (b) the date after the Sale of the API Business upon which (i) the Company or the Acquiring Company terminates your employment for any reason other than "Cause," or (ii) you terminate your employment due to a "Constructive Termination," as further described in this letter and you accept such termination without making any claim for damages, payments or entitlements ("Damages") not provided in this letter (including any Damages under Norwegian law) and provide the Company with an executed release of any right to receive such Damages in form and substance which the Company's Norwegian counsel advises is sufficient to release the Company from any obligation to pay Damages. For the purposes of this letter, a termination for Cause shall mean your termination by the Company or the Acqui
ring Company due to (a) conviction of a felony, or (b) substantial and willful neglect of job duties or willful misconduct, in either case having a material and demonstrable effect on the Company or the Acquiring Company or (c) termination for any other reason justifiable under Norwegian law.</P></DIR>

<P>The Transaction Bonus ("Transaction Bonus") shall be equal to an amount as provided on Appendix A hereto.</P>
<P>Any Transaction Bonus due hereunder shall be payable in cash within ten (10) business days after the satisfaction of the employment criteria set forth in (2) above. </P>
<U><P>Treatment of Annual Bonuses and Equity Awards.</P>
</U><P>A.&#9;<U>Annual Bonus</U>.</P>
<P>If a Qualifying Transaction occurs while you are an active employee of the Company and prior to December 12, 2008, your annual cash bonus for the calendar year of such Qualifying Transaction will be treated as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;&#9;(1)&#9;if the Qualifying Transaction is either (x) a Sale of the API Business that occurs on or prior to June 30 of any calendar year, or (y) a "Change in Control" of Alpharma under Alpharma's Change in Control Plan, which occurs at anytime during the calendar year, the Company will pay you a pro-rata bonus based on your target annual bonus opportunity, as in existence immediately prior to the Qualifying Transaction, under the Executive Bonus Plan based on the portion of such calendar year that occurred prior to the Qualifying Transaction, payable ten (10) business days after the applicable Qualifying Transaction; or</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;(2)&#9;if the Qualifying Transaction is a Sale of the API Business that occurs after June 30 of any calendar year, the Company will pay you a pro-rata bonus for that year based on actual performance under the criteria established in accordance with the terms of the Executive Bonus Plan based on the portion of such calendar year that occurred prior to the Qualifying Transaction, payable between January 1 and March 15 of the following calendar year.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>B.&#9;<U>Equity Awards</U>.</P>
<P>If a Qualifying Transaction occurs while you are an active employee of the Company, then any Stock Options, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units of Alpharma issued to you prior to the date of such Qualifying Transaction under either the 1997 Incentive Stock Option and Appreciation Rights Plan or the 2003 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (or any successor plans) shall immediately vest (but otherwise be governed by the terms of such applicable grant document and Incentive Plan); provided that, if such Qualifying Transaction is a "Change in Control" of Alpharma under Alpharma's Change in Control Plan, then any such vesting with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall instead occur upon the earliest of (i) the vesting date set forth in the applicable grant document, or (ii) the termination of your employment with the Company or the entity that acquires the Company (the "Acquiring Company") prior to the second anniversary of the Qualifying Transaction either by your employer withou
t Cause or by you pursuant to a Constructive Termination of employment, as further described below.<I> </P>
</I><U><P>Special Severance Arrangement</U>.</P>
<P>Should a Qualifying Transaction occur while you are an active employee of the Company and your employment with the Company or the Acquiring Company is terminated on or after the Qualifying Transaction, but on or prior to the second anniversary of the Qualifying Transaction (either by your employer without Cause or pursuant to a Constructive Termination of employment, as further described below), you shall receive from the Company the severance benefits and payments set forth in Appendix B of this Agreement.</P>
<P>For purposes of this Agreement, a Constructive Termination means your voluntary termination following (i) any material reduction in your base salary or in your target annual bonus opportunity, as in existence immediately prior to the Qualifying Transaction, (ii) your relocation to a base office or site that is more than 50 miles from the location of your present base office or site, (iii) any material reduction in your health, welfare and pension benefits in the aggregate or (iv) the assignment of duties substantially inconsistent with, or a substantial diminution of, the duties, responsibilities or status of your position with the Company immediately prior to the Qualifying Transaction; provided that, if you are eligible to voluntarily terminate employment pursuant to a Constructive Termination of employment within the first six months after the date of the Qualifying Transaction, the Company or the Acquiring Company may request that you continue as a full time employee to assist with transition and othe
r activities reasonably appropriate to your position, your background and history with the Company with no reduction in base salary, target annual bonus opportunity or benefits, and no relocation, as described above in the definition of "Constructive Termination" until six months after the Qualifying Transaction and any benefits and payments required under this paragraph shall be payable only upon your completion of such service, or your death or termination due to Disability. In any of the foregoing events, in order to qualify as a Constructive Termination of employment, you must have provided written notice to your employer of the circumstances that entitle you to terminate due to a Constructive Termination, and the employer must be afforded 30 days in which to cure such circumstances before you can resign due to a Constructive Termination.</P>
<B><U><P>Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Obligations</U>.</P>
</B><P>The payments and benefits provided for hereunder are conditional on your agreement not to engage in competition with, or to solicit employees of, the Company and its affiliates, as further provided in Appendix C of this Agreement.</P>
<B><U><P>No Mitigation</U>.</P>
</B><P>Unless expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company agrees that any income or other employment benefits received by you from any and all sources other than the Company, the Acquiring Company and their respective affiliates for any reason whatsoever shall in no way reduce or otherwise affect the Company's obligations to make payments and afford benefits under this Agreement.</P>
<B><U><P>Miscellaneous</U>.</P>
</B><P>You confirm that you have previously received copies of all Plans, employment letters and other agreements referred to in this Letter Agreement.</P>
<P>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws Norway.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, no other benefits shall be provided to you upon or after the occurrence of a Qualifying Transaction, including benefits set forth in Alpharma's Severance or Change in Control Plans or any employment letter or agreement, or other plan or arrangement, in existence prior to the date of this Agreement and no amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken into account for purposes of any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any affiliate of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that the Company or an Acquiring Company makes a payment or payments to you under Norwegian or other applicable law as a result of a Qualifying Transaction or any termination of employment within two years after a Qualifying Transaction, the amount of such payment shall reduce, by an equal amount, (i) first, any payments due to you under the Special Severance Arrangement set forth above and; (ii) if said payments made under
 applicable law exceed the amount of the Special Severance Arrangement, then, payments due under the Transaction Bonus. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon execution of this Agreement, the 2005 Letter, shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect without regard to the occurrence or a Qualifying Transaction.</P>
<P>Payments to you by the Company and its affiliates shall be subject to all applicable legal requirements with respect to withholding of taxes and you shall be responsible for all applicable Norwegian taxes which, under applicable laws and regulations, are payable by you or otherwise your responsibility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto, any successors to or assigns of the Company and your heirs and the personal representatives of your estate. If the Company or the Acquiring Company consolidates with or merges into or sells all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation, partnership or other entity or person, the Company (or the Acquiring Company, as the case may be) shall require such corporation, partnership or other entity or person to assume this Agreement, and upon such assumption, the successor corporation, partnership or other entity or person shall become obligated to perform all of the terms and conditions set forth herein.</P>
<P>This Agreement may not be modified, amended or waived in any manner except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision in this Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed to operate as a waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any subsequent breach by such party of any provision of this Agreement.</P>
<P>This Agreement is not an offer or promise of continuing employment by the Company. In addition, the Company shall have no responsibility or liability for your employment by an Acquiring Company other than with respect to payments due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</P>
<P>We ask that you acknowledge that, by countersigning this Agreement, you are agreeing to maintain a strict level of confidence regarding all information disclosed, developed or learned by you in the performance of your duties with the Company, including any facts, circumstances or discussions that could lead to a Qualifying Transaction ("Confidential Information"). By countersigning this Agreement, you agree that, unless you first secure the written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Alpharma, you shall not disclose or use at any time, either during or after employment by the Company, any Confidential Information except to the extent that you are required to disclose or use such Confidential Information by law or in the performance of your assigned duties for the Company. This obligation is in addition to the confidentiality agreement that you have previously executed as an employee of the Company, the general obligation of confidentiality existing under the law and the Non-Competition and Non-Solic
itation obligations included herewith as Appendix C.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any payments hereunder that (i) are subject to United States Income Tax and (ii) would be subject to the additional income or excise tax imposed (x) by Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall be deferred until the earliest date that such payments may be made without the imposition of such tax, and any payments that would have been made to you but for this sentence shall be accumulated (without interest) and paid to you on such date or (y) by Section 4999 of the Code, shall be subject to the "Gross Up" provisions as set forth in Attachment B of this Letter Agreement.</P>
<P>We believe that the Retention Award, Transaction Bonus and other potential payments and benefits set forth above clearly reflect your value to this organization and provide you with enhanced financial benefits in connection with the potential Qualifying Transaction.</P>
<P>Please indicate your acknowledgement of this Agreement, and our acceptance of its terms, by countersigning this Agreement where indicated below and returning one copy to the Company.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>

<P>For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Consideration" shall mean the gross value of all cash, securities and other properties paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by the Acquiring Company in one transaction or in a series or combination of transactions, in connection with the Qualifying Transaction (including, without limitation, amounts paid pursuant to covenants not to compete or similar arrangements, but not consideration paid to employees of the API Business as a result of a "change in control", an incentive to complete the Qualifying Transaction, or severance). Consideration shall not include the amount of value of any liabilities of the API Business assumed by the Acquiring Company except any indebtedness for borrowed money and any pension liabilities and guarantees related to the API Business indirectly or directly assumed or acquired, or otherwise repaid or retired, by the Acquiring Company. Consideration shall include all amounts paid into escrow payable to the Company in connection with t
he Qualifying Transaction. If the Consideration to be paid is computed in any foreign currency, the value of such foreign currency shall, for purposes hereof, be converted into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate on the date or dates on which such Consideration is paid (including into escrow). Furthermore, the value of any securities (whether debt or equity) or other property paid or payable as part of the Consideration shall be determined as follows: (a) the value of securities that are freely tradable in an established public market will be determined on the basis of the last market closing price prior to the public announcement of the Qualifying Transaction; and (b) the value of securities that are not freely tradable or have no established public market, (or if the Consideration utilized consists of property other than securities, the value of such property), shall be the value thereof as mutually agreed by the Company and the Acquiring Company.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Appendix B</P>
<P>Special Severance Arrangement</P>
</U><P>The benefits and payments set forth in this Appendix B are as follows:</P>
<P>1.&#9;<U>Cash Severance</U> - Two and one-half (2.5) times the sum of (a) your base salary, plus (b) your target annual bonus opportunity, in both cases as in effect immediately prior to a Qualifying Transaction. Severance shall be payable in equal monthly installments over 30 months commencing on the first day of the calendar month after your termination of employment, except as otherwise provided herein.</P>
<P>2.&#9;<U>Medical, Dental and/or Life Insurance Coverage</U> - Continued coverage for medical, dental, accidental death and dismemberment and life insurance (including medical and dental coverage for your covered dependents, if any) under the Company's group benefits plan, as if you had remained an active employee of the Company, for a period of 30 months after termination of employment at the active employee rate. In the event you are ineligible under the terms of one or more of such plans to continue to be so covered, the Company shall provide you with substantially equivalent coverage through other sources to the extent permitted by applicable law. </P>
<P>3.&#9;<U>Outplacement</U> - Outplacement support in accordance with the Company's outplacement policies in effect on the date of this Agreement.</P>
<P>4.&#9;<U>Employee Benefits</U> - Without duplication of the above, any benefits to which you are entitled under the terms of any Company pension or welfare benefit plan or program, other than any severance plan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Appendix C</P>
</U><P>&#9;1.&#9;<U>Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Interference</P>
</U><P>For the benefit of Alpharma and the Company and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Protected Parties"), you hereby agree as follows:</P>
<P>(i)&#9;<U>Non-Competition</U>. During the 12-month period after the Qualifying Transaction, you will not, directly or indirectly:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(A)&#9;engage in any business that competes with any business that Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries was conducting immediately prior to the date of the Qualifying Transaction (the "<U>Relevant Date</U>"), including, without limitation, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Business and any businesses that Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries is actively considering conducting on the Relevant Date, so long as you know or reasonably should have known about such plan(s) in any geographical area that is within 100 miles of any geographical area where Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries provides its products or services as of the Relevant Date (a "<U>competitive Business</U>")</P>
<P>(B)&#9;enter the employ of, or render any services to, any person or legal entity (or any division or controlled or controlling affiliate of any person or legal entity) who or which is a Competitive Business as of the date you enter such employment or render such services; or</P>
<P>(C)&#9;acquire a financial interest in, or otherwise become actively involved with, any Competitive Business which is a Competitive Business as of the date of such acquisition or involvement, directly or indirectly, as an individual, partner, shareholder, officer, director, principal, agent, trustee or consultant.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The foregoing shall not prohibit you from (1) investing, as a passive investor, in any publicly held company provided that your beneficial ownership of any class of such publicly held company's securities does not exceed two percent (2%) of the outstanding securities of such class or (2) providing services to a subsidiary or affiliate of an entity that controls a separate subsidiary or affiliate that is a Competitive Business, so long as the subsidiary or affiliate for which you may be providing services is not itself a Competitive Business and you are not, as an employee of such subsidiary or affiliate, engaging in activities that would otherwise cause such subsidiary or affiliate to be deemed a Competitive Business.</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;<U>Non-Interference with Business Relationships</U>. During the 30-month period after the Qualifying Transaction (such period, the "<U>Restricted Period</U>"), you will not interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, business relationships (whether formed before, on or after the date of this Agreement) between any Protected Party and its customers, suppliers or partners, in any such ease determined as of the Relevant Date.</P>
<P>The provisions of subsections (i) and (ii) may be waived in writing in whole or in part by the Chief Executive Officer of Alpharma (after consulting with the Compensation Committee of Alpharma's Board of Directors).</P>
<P>(iii) &#9;<U>Non-Solicitation of</U> <U>Employees; Non-Solicitation of</U> <U>Consultants</U>. During the Restricted Period, you will not, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person or entity, directly or indirectly:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(A)&#9;solicit or encourage any employee of Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries to leave the employment of Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries; or</P>
<P>(B)&#9;hire any such employee who was employed by Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries as of the Relevant Date or who left the employment of Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries coincident with, or within one year prior to or after, the Relevant Date; or</P>
<P>(C)&#9;solicit or encourage to cease to work with Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries any consultant that you know, or reasonably should have known, is then under contract with Alpharma or its affiliates or subsidiaries.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(iv) <U>Enforcement</U>. It is expressly understood and agreed that although the Company, Alpharma and you consider the restrictions contained in this Appendix C to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Appendix C is an unenforceable restriction against you, the provisions of this Appendix C shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable (provided that in no event shall any such amendment broaden the time period or scope of any restriction herein). Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Appendix C is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained h
erein.</P>
<P>&#9;2.&#9;<U>Parachute Tax Gross-Up</P>
</U><P>(i)&#9;If (a) it shall be determined that any payment, benefit or distribution (or combination thereof) by the Company, the Acquiring Company or any of their respective affiliates, or one or more trusts established by the Company for the benefit of its employees, to or for your benefit (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or otherwise) (a "<U>Payment</U>") is subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by you with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "<U>Excise Tax</U>"), and (b) such Excise Tax would be equal to $50,000 or less, then such Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the Payment is equal to 2.99 times your "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code). If (x) it shall be determined that any Payment is subject to Excise Tax and (y) such Excis
e Tax would be greater than $50,000, then you shall be entitled to receive from the Company an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by you of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and the Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, you retain an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;All determinations required to be made under this Paragraph 2, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by BDO Seidman, LLP or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Company (the "<U>Accounting Firm</U>") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and you within ten business days of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company; <U>provided</U> that for purposes of determining the amount of any Gross-Up Payment, you shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rates applicable to individuals in the calendar year in which any such Gross-Up Payment is to be made and deemed to pay state and local income taxes at the highest effective rates applicable to individuals in the state or locality o
f your residence or place of employment in the calendar year in which any such Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes, taking into account limitations applicable to individuals subject to federal income tax at the highest marginal rates. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Paragraph 2, shall be paid by the Company to you (or to the appropriate taxing authority on your behalf) when due, but in no event later than the end of the taxable year next following the taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the IRS or other taxing authority. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by you, it shall so indicate to you in writing. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and you. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 
4999 of the Code, it is possible that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment determined by the Accounting Firm to be due to (or on behalf of) you was lower than the amount actually due ("<U>Underpayment</U>"). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Paragraph 2(iii) and you thereafter are required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of you.</P>
<P>(iii) You shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of any Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after you are is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. You shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty day period following the date on which you give such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies you in writing prior to the expiration of' such period that it desires to contest such claim, you shall (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writi
ng from dine to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company, (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to effectively contest such claim and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; <U>provided,</U> <U>however</U>, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 2(iii), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and con
ferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct you to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and you agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; <U>provided,</U> <U>further</U>, that if the Company directs you to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to you, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that if you are required to extend the statute of limitations to enable the Company to contest such claim, you may limit this extension so
lely to such contested amount. The Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the ease may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.</P>
<P>(iv)&#9; If, after the receipt by you of an amount paid or advanced by the Company pursuant to this Paragraph 2, you become entitled to receive any refund with respect to a Gross-Up Payment, you shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Paragraph 2(iii)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund received (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by you of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Paragraph 2(iii), a determination is made that you shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify you in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.</P>

The Plan is an unfunded arrangement established and maintained by the Company for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to January 1, 2006, Participants were permitted to defer a portion of their Compensation to the Plan after their pre-tax deferrals under the Alpharma Inc.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No employee shall become a Participant in the Plan after December 31, 2005. Participants are no longer permitted to elect to defer Compensation effective as of the first payroll period ending in 2006. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder and related guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">DEFINITIONS</A></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever the following words and phrases are used in this Plan, with the first letter capitalized, they shall have the meanings specified below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1&#9;"Account" or "Accounts" shall mean all of such accounts as are established under this Plan from time to time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&#9;"Base Salary" shall mean a Participant's annual base compensation, excluding bonuses, commissions, incentive and all other remuneration for services rendered to Company and prior to reduction for any salary deferrals, including but not limited to, deferrals under plans established pursuant to Section 125 of the Code or qualified pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3&#9;"Beneficiary" or "Beneficiaries" shall mean the person or persons, including a trustee, personal representative or other fiduciary, last designated in writing by a Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Committee to receive the benefits specified hereunder in the event of the Participant's death. No beneficiary designation shall become effective until it is filed with the Committee. Any designation shall be revocable at any time through a written instrument filed by the Participant with the Committee with or without the consent of the previous Beneficiary. In the event that a Participant who designated his or her spouse as Beneficiary under the Plan subsequently becomes divorced or legally separated, then such prior Beneficiary designation shall automatically be deemed revoked as it relates to the spouse (or former spouse), unless it is subsequently ratified in writing by the Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is no such designation, or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, then the Participant's surviving spouse shall be the Beneficiary. If there is no surviving spouse, the duly appointed and currently acting personal representative of the Participant's estate (which shall include either the Participant's probate estate or living trust) shall be the Beneficiary. In any case where there is no such personal representative of the Participant's estate duly appointed and acting in that capacity within 90 days after the Participant's death (or such extended period as the Committee determines is reasonably necessary to allow such personal representative to be appointed, but not to exceed 180 days after the Participant's death), then Beneficiary shall mean the person or persons who can verify by affidavit or court order to the satisfaction of the Committee that they are legally entitled to receive the benefits specified hereunder. In the event any amount is payable under the Plan to
 a minor, payment shall not be made to the minor, but instead be paid (a) to that person's living parent(s) to act as custodian, (b) if that person's parents are then divorced, and one parent is the sole custodial parent, to such custodial parent, to act as custodian, or (c) if no parent of that person is then living, to a custodian selected by the Committee to hold the funds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the jurisdiction in which the minor resides. If no parent is living and the Committee decides not to select another custodian to hold the funds for the minor, then payment shall be made to the duly appointed and currently acting guardian of the estate for the minor or, if no guardian of the estate for the minor is duly appointed and currently acting within 60 days after the date the amount becomes payable, payment shall be deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the estate of the minor. Payment by the Company pursuant to any unrevoked Beneficiary des
ignation, or to the Participant's estate if no such designation exists, shall be considered complete satisfaction of all benefits owed under the Plan. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.4&#9;"Board of Directors" or "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of Company.</P>

<A NAME="_Toc467396950">PARTICIPATION</A></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&#9;<U>Eligibility</U>. The Board shall designate, as of the Effective Date and as of the beginning of each Plan Year, each employee as an Eligible Employee. The Committee may designate an employee as an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year, provided that such employee after the beginning of the Plan Year, (a) is hired by the Company, or (b) becomes a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. No employee shall become a Participant in the Plan after December 31, 2005.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2&#9;<U>Participation</U>. An Eligible Employee shall become a Participant in the Plan by timely executing a Compensation Deferral Election and a Payment Election, and filing them with the Committee in accordance with Article III of the Plan. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE III </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="_Toc467396951">DEFERRAL ELECTIONS</A> AND COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS</P>
</B><P><A NAME="_Toc467396952">3.1&#9;<U>Elections to Defer Compensation</U>.</A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Initial Election Period</U>. Each Eligible Employee may elect to defer Compensation by filing with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election that conforms to the requirements of this Section 3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that Committee may specify). Such Compensation Deferral Election, however, can only relate to Compensation that has not yet been earned. No later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that the Committee may specify), the Eligible Employee shall also file with the Committee a Payment Election with respect to such deferral of Compensation and related Company Matching Contributions, if any, on a form provided by the Committee. In the event that an Eligible Employee does not file a Payment Election during the Initial Election Period, the Eligible Employee shall be deemed to have elected a lump sum with respect to such deferra
l of Compensation and related Company Matching Contributions. The deemed election of the lump sum will continue in effect for future Plan Years until the Eligible Employee makes a new Payment Election pursuant to subsection (d). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>General Rule</U>. The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer is such Compensation to be earned after the time at which the Eligible Employee files with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a). The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer shall be a percentage of Compensation, which shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Eligible Employee's Compensation, provided that the total amount deferred by a Participant shall be limited in any calendar year, if necessary, to satisfy social security taxes (including Medicare), income taxes and employee benefit plan withholding requirements, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Committee. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Duration of Compensation Deferral Election</U>. An Eligible Employee's initial Compensation Deferral Election must be made prior to the Effective Date and is to be effective with respect to Compensation earned after such Compensation Deferral Election is processed. A Participant may increase, decrease or terminate a Compensation Deferral Election with respect to Compensation for any subsequent Plan Year by filing a new Compensation Deferral Election not less than 14 days prior to the beginning of the next Plan Year, which election shall be effective on the first day of the next following Plan Year. In the absence of an affirmative election by the Participant to the contrary, a Compensation Deferral Election for one Plan Year will continue in effect for future Plan Years. In the case of an employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Effective Date, such Eligible Employee shall have 30 days from the date he or she has become an Eligible Employee to make an Initial Election 
with respect to deferral of Compensation. Such Compensation Deferral Election shall be for the remainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced. All Compensation Deferral Elections made prior to December 31, 2005 shall be revoked with respect to compensation paid after the last payroll period in 2005.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Duration of Payment Election</U>. An Eligible Employee's initial Payment Election to defer Compensation must be made prior to the Effective Date and is to be effective with respect to Compensation earned after such Compensation Deferral Election is processed. The Payment Election as to timing and form of payment of such deferred Compensation is irrevocable for a given Plan Year, except as otherwise provided herein. A Participant may change his or her Payment Election with respect to Compensation for any subsequent Plan Year by filing a new Payment Election not less than 14 days prior to the beginning of the next Plan Year, which Payment Election shall be effective on the first day of the next following Plan Year. In the absence of an affirmative Payment Election by the Participant to the contrary, a Payment Election for one Plan Year will continue in effect for future Plan Years. In the case of an employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Effective Date, such Eligible E
mployee shall have 30 days from the date he or she has become an Eligible Employee to make an Initial Election with respect to payment of Compensation. Such Payment Election shall be for the remainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may modify his or her Payment Election for a prior Plan Year only in accordance with Section 6.1. All Payment Elections made prior to December&nbsp;31, 2005 shall be revoked.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;<U>Elections other than Elections during the Initial Election Period</U>. Subject to the limitations of Section 3.1(b) above, any Eligible Employee who has terminated a prior Compensation Deferral Election may elect to again defer Compensation, by filing a Compensation Deferral Election and a Payment Election, on forms provided by the Committee, not less than 14 days prior to the beginning of the Plan Year to which such Compensation Deferral Election relates. An election to defer Compensation must be filed in a timely manner in accordance with Sections 3.1(c) and (d).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&#9;<U>Timing of Deferrals</U>. Deferrals to the Plan made pursuant to a Participant's Compensation Deferral Election shall commence on the first day of the first payroll period immediately following the payroll period in which the Participant's pre-tax deferrals reach the applicable dollar amount under Section 402(g) of the Code for that year and shall continue until deferrals under the Plan reach the percentage specified in the Participant's Compensation Deferral Election. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3&#9;<U>Company Matching Contributions</U>. The Company shall credit a Company Matching Contribution to each Participant's Company Matching Contribution Account in an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the first six percent (6%) of the amount of Compensation deferred under the Plan:</P>

<BR>
<A NAME="_Toc467396950">PARTICIPATION</A></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&#9;<U>Eligibility</U>. The Committee shall designate, as of the Effective Date and as of the beginning of each Plan Year, such employee of the Company, as it determined in its sole discretion, as an Eligible Employee. The Committee may, from time to time, designate an employee as an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="_Toc467396951">DEFERRAL ELECTIONS</A> </P>
</B><P><A NAME="_Toc467396952">3.1&#9;<U>Elections to Defer Compensation</U>.</A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Initial Election Period</U>. Each Eligible Employee may elect to defer Compensation by filing with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election that conforms to the requirements of this Section 3.1, on a form provided by the Committee, no later than the last day of his or her Initial Election Period (or such earlier date that the Committee may specify). Such Compensation Deferral Election, however, can only relate to Compensation that has not yet been earned. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>General Rule</U>. The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer is such Compensation to be earned after the time at which the Eligible Employee files with the Committee a Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a). The amount of Compensation which an Eligible Employee may elect to defer shall be a percentage of Compensation, which shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the Eligible Employee's Compensation, provided that the total amount deferred by a Participant shall be limited in any calendar year, if necessary, in order to satisfy social security taxes (including Medicare), income taxes and employee benefit plan withholding requirements, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Committee. A Participant may elect to defer different percentages of his or her Base Salary and STIP.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>Duration of Compensation Deferral Election</U>. An Eligible Employee's Compensation Deferral Election for a Plan Year is irrevocable for that Plan Year. A Participant may increase, decrease or terminate a Compensation Deferral Election with respect to Compensation for any subsequent Plan Year by filing a new Compensation Deferral Election not less than 16 days prior to the beginning of the next Plan Year, which election shall be effective on the first day of the next following Plan Year. In the absence of an affirmative election by the Participant to the contrary, a Compensation Deferral Election for one Plan Year will continue in effect for future Plan Years. In the case of an employee who is hired by the Company during the Plan Year and is an Eligible Employee, such Eligible Employee shall have 30 days from the date he or she becomes an Eligible Employee to make an Initial Election with respect to deferral of Compensation. Such Compensation Deferral Election shall be for the re
mainder of the Plan Year (and future Plan Years, unless subsequently changed prior to the commencement of a given Plan Year) in the event the Plan Year has commenced. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Elections other than Elections during the Initial Election Period</U>. Subject to the limitations of Section 3.1(b) above, any Eligible Employee who has terminated a prior Compensation Deferral Election may elect to again defer Compensation, by filing a Compensation Deferral Election on forms provided by the Committee, not less than 16 days prior to the beginning of the Plan Year to which such Compensation Deferral Election relates. An election to defer Compensation must be filed in a timely manner in accordance with Section 3.1(c).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&#9;<U>Timing of Deferrals</U>. Deferrals to the Plan made pursuant to a Participant's Compensation Deferral Election shall commence on the first day of the first payroll period in each Plan Year and shall continue until the last payroll period in the Plan Year. In the case of a Participant who becomes a Participant during a Plan Year, deferrals to Plan pursuant to his or her Compensation Deferral Election shall commence on the first day of the first administratively practicable payroll period after the Participant submits his or her Compensation Deferral Election in accordance with Section 3.1(a) of the Plan.</P>

In making the designation pursuant to this Section 3.3, the Participant may specify that all or any percentage of his or her Account is to be deemed invested, in whole percentage increments, in one or more of the types of Funds deemed to be provided under the Plan, as communicated from time to time by the Committee. A Participant may change the designation made under Section 3.3 at any time. If a Participant fails to elect a type of Fund under this Section 3.3, he or she shall be deemed to have elected the Funds elected by the Participant (or otherwise in effect) under the Savings Plan.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Although the Participant may designate the type of investments, the Committee shall not be bound by such designation. The Committee shall select from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion, commercially available investments of each of the types communicated by the Committee to the Participant pursuant to Section 3.3(a) above to be the Funds.

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc467396955">4.1&#9;<U>Participant Accounts</U>.</A> The Committee shall establish and maintain, or cause to be established and maintain, an Account for each Participant under the Plan. Each Participant's Account shall be further divided into separate subaccounts ("Investment Fund Subaccounts"), each of which corresponds to a Fund elected by the Participant pursuant to Section 3.3(a). A Participant's Account shall be credited as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;As soon as administratively practicable after amounts are withheld and deferred from a Participant's Compensation, the Committee shall credit the Investment Fund Subaccounts of the Participant's Account with an amount equal to Compensation deferred by the Participant in accordance with the Participant's election under Section 3.3(a); that is, the portion of the Participant's deferred Compensation that the Participant has elected to be deemed to be invested in a certain type of Fund shall be credited to the Investment Fund Subaccount corresponding to that Fund; and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;Each business day, each Investment Fund Subaccount of a Participant's Account shall be credited with earnings or losses in an amount determined by multiplying the balance credited to such Investment Fund Subaccount as of the prior day, plus contributions credited that day to the Investment Fund Subaccount, by the Interest Rate for the corresponding Fund selected by the Company pursuant to Section 3.3(b).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc467396957">4.2&#9;<U>Trust Funding</U>.</A> The Company may create a trust with a trustee. In the event that the Company creates a trust, the Company may cause the trust to be funded each year. Although the principal of the trust and any earnings thereon shall be held separate and apart from other funds of the Company and shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of the Plan, Participants and Beneficiaries as set forth therein, neither the Participants nor their Beneficiaries shall have any preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership in, any assets of the trust prior to the time such assets are paid to the Participants or Beneficiaries as Plan benefits. All rights created under this Plan shall be unsecured contractual rights of Plan Participants and Beneficiaries against the Company. Any assets held in the trust will be subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors under federal and state law in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency as defined in the a
greement governing the trust. The assets of the Plan and trust shall never inure to the benefit of the Company, except to the extent required in the event of the Company's bankruptcy or insolvency, and the same shall be held for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their Beneficiaries and for defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan and trust.</P>

</B><P><A NAME="_Toc467396960">5.1&#9;<U>Distribution Upon Termination from Employment</A></U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of a Participant who Terminates from Employment with the Company, such Participant's Account shall be paid to him or her in the form of a lump sum on the Participant's Payment Date. The Participant's Account shall continue to be credited with earnings pursuant to Article IV of the Plan until all amounts credited to his or her Account under the Plan have been distributed. For purpose of this Section 5.1, whether a <A NAME="jumpdest_1409a1h1ii">Termination from Employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstances indicate that the Company and the Participant reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Participant would perform after such date (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immed
iately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services to the Company if the Participant has been providing services to the Company less than 36 months</A>). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.2&#9;<U>Distribution on Account of Participant's Death</U>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of a Participant who dies prior to the date that his or her Account is distributed, such Participant's Beneficiary shall receive the Participant's Account in a lump sum payment on the first day of the month following the Participant's death. In no event shall payment to the Participant's Beneficiary be made later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participants died, or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date on which the Participant died.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc467396962">5.3&#9;<U>Unforeseeable Emergency</U>.</A> A Participant shall be permitted to elect a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency from his or her Account prior to the Payment Date, subject to the following restrictions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The election to take such a distribution shall be made by filing a form provided by and filed with Committee prior to the end of any calendar month.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Committee shall have made a determination that the requested distribution constitutes an Unforeseeable Emergency in accordance with the terms of the Plan and Section 409A of the Code, and that the amount of the distribution is not in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the extreme financial emergency, plus any tax liability associated with the payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The amount determined by the Committee as a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be paid in a single cash lump sum on the last day of the calendar month in which the election is approved by the Committee, but in no event later than the last day of the second calendar month in which the election is approved by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.4&#9;<U>Distribution Upon a Change in Control</U>. A Participant's Account shall not be distributed upon a Change in Control. A "Change of Control" of shall be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of the one of the following events:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) &#9;A change in the ownership of the Company (as defined under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder); </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) &#9;A change in effective control of the Company (as defined under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder); and </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc467396963">5.5&#9;<U>Payment of Taxes</U>. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the timing of the distribution of a Participant's Account may be accelerated as may be necessary to pay Federal Insurance Contributions Act Tax ("FICA Tax") imposed under Sections 3101 and 3121(v)(2) of the Code. The timing of the distribution of a Participant's Account also may be accelerated as may be necessary to pay the income tax on wages imposed under Section 3401 of the Code on the FICA Tax amount, and to pay the additional income tax on wages attributable to the pyramiding of Section 3401 wages and taxes. However, the total payment amount that is accelerated must not exceed the aggregate of the FICA Tax amount, and the income tax withholding related to the FICA Tax amount.&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.6&#9;<U>Inability to Locate Participant</U>.</A> In the event that the Committee is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary within two years following the required Payment Date, the amount allocated to the Participant's Account shall be forfeited. If, after such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary later claims such benefit, such benefit shall be reinstated without interest or earnings.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 1</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Introduction</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1&#9;<U>The Plan and Its Effective Date</U>. The A. L. Pharma Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan (the "Plan") is maintained by Alpharma Inc. (the "Company"). The Plan was originally established by A. L. Pharma Inc. effective as of July 1, 1994 and was amended and restated effective January 1, 2005. The Plan is being amended and restated in its entirety effective January 1, 2008. With respect to benefits under the Plan that were not in "pay status" as of December 31, 2004, the Company intends that Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") shall apply. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2&#9;<U>Purpose</U>. The Company maintains the Alpharma Inc. Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") which is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan" under the Code. While the Code places limitations on the maximum amount of an employee's compensation that may be taken into account for determining benefits payable under a qualified plan, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), permits the payment under an "unfunded plan" of the benefits which may not be paid under a qualified plan because of such limitation. The purpose of this Plan is to provide a certain level of additional benefits which may not be provided under the pension plan because of the maximum compensation limitation of the Code. Effective January 1, 2006, participation in, and accruals under, the Plan were frozen. </P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 2</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Benefits</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1&#9;<U>Eligibility</U>. Only those highly compensated or key management employees of the Company or its affiliates, who participate in the Pension Plan and who were employed on June 30, 1994, shall participate in the Plan (the "Participants"), subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan. Highly compensated key management employees hired after June 30, 1994 and before January 1, 2006, shall be eligible to participate in the Plan at the discretion of the Committee. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2&#9;<U>Amount of Benefits</U>. Subject to Section 2.3 below, with respect to a Participant who becomes entitled to a pension benefit under the Pension Plan, and such benefit has been limited as a result of the maximum compensation limitation imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (as such maximum compensation limitation is incorporated in the Pension Plan and as it may be changed from time to time), he or she shall be entitled to receive under this Plan the portion of the Participant's benefit under the Pension Plan which exceeds the benefit payable to the Participant under the Pension Plan after applying the legal maximum compensation limitation; provided, however, that the annual compensation earned by a Participant for this purpose shall not exceed $235,840. Such estimated limitation shall be determined by the Committee (as defined in section 3.1). A Participant's benefit under this Plan shall be referred to hereinafter as a Participant's "Supplemental Pension Benefit." With respe
ct to determining a Participant's Supplemental Pension Benefit, service after December 31, 2005 and compensation paid after the last payroll period ending in 2005, shall not be taken into account. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3&#9;<U>Vesting</U>. If a Participant resigns or is dismissed from the employ of the Company and all of its controlled group members prior to completing at least five years of employment service with the Company or any member of its controlled group, the Participant shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participants (i) whose employment was transferred from the controlled group that includes the Company to the controlled group that includes Actavis Group hf. on or about December 16, 2005, or (ii) who were employees involuntarily terminated as a result of the sale of the Company's generics business, shall be entitled to a benefit under the Plan based on their service through their termination date, regardless of whether such Participants had completed at least five years of employment service on their termination date. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4&#9;<U>Payment of Benefits</U>. Upon a Participant's Termination from Employment, a Participant's Supplemental Pension Benefit under the Plan shall be paid to the Participant, or in the event of his or her death, the Participant's beneficiary, in a lump sum on the date that is six months after such Participant's Termination from Employment, but in event later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant has been Terminated from Employment for six months, or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date on which the Participant has been Terminated from Employment for six months. For purpose of this Section 2.4, whether a <A NAME="jumpdest_1409a1h1ii">Termination of Employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstances indicate that the Company and the Participant reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Particip
ant would perform after such date (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services to the Company if the Participant has been providing services to the Company less than 36 months</A>). The lump sum payment shall be determined using Applicable Interest Rate and the Applicable Mortality, both as defined under the Code and the regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to contrary, if a Participant is receiving his or her Supplemental Pension Benefit in the form of an annuity, upon the Participant's death, his or her beneficiary shall be entitled to survivor benefits provided under the form of annuity, if any. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4&#9;<U>Funding</U>. Benefits payable under this Plan to a Participant or his beneficiary shall be paid directly by the Company. The Company shall not be required to segregate on its books or otherwise any amount to be used for payment of supplemental pension benefits under this Plan. This Plan shall constitute an unfunded arrangement and any amounts actually set aside by the Company shall remain as Company assets, subject to the general creditors of the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 3</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">General Provisions</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1&#9;<U>Committee</U>. This Plan shall be administered by the pension plan administrative committee (the "Committee"). The Committee shall have, to the extent appropriate, the same powers, rights, duties and obligations with respect to this Plan as it has with respect to the pension plan. Each determination provided for in this Plan shall be made by the Committee under such procedure as may from time to time be prescribed by the Committee and shall be made in the absolute discretion of the Committee. Any determination so made shall be conclusive on all parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&#9;<U>Beneficiary</U>. A participant's "beneficiary" under this Plan means (i) any person who becomes entitled to benefits under the pension plan because of the participant's death, or (ii) if the Participant has no designated beneficiary for purposes of the pension plan as set forth in (i) above, or if his or her beneficiary designated for purposes of the pension plan as set forth in (i) above dies before the date of the participant's death, any one or more of the participant's estate and his or her relatives by blood or marriage, in such proportions as the Committee determines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3&#9;<U>Employment Rights</U>. Establishment of the Plan shall not be construed to give any participant the right to be retained in the Company's service or to any benefits not specifically provided by the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4&#9;<U>Withholding</U>. The Committee shall deduct from all payments under the Plan any taxes required to be withheld under the laws of the United States or any state, including but not limited to Federal and/or state income and employment taxes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.5&#9;<U>Interests Not Transferable</U>. Except as to withholding of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state, the interests of the participants and their beneficiaries under the Plan are not subject to the claims of their creditors and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred, assigned, alienated or encumbered. No participant shall have any right to any benefit payments hereunder prior to the Participant's termination of employment with the Company and all other companies which are part of the controlled group of companies which includes the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.6&#9;<U>Payment with Respect to Incapacitated Participants or Beneficiaries</U>. If any person entitled to benefits under the Plan is under a legal disability or in the Committee's opinion is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or her financial affairs, the Committee may direct the payment of such benefit to such person's legal representative or to a relative or friend of such person for such person's benefit, or the Committee may direct the application of such benefits for the benefit of such person in any manner which the Committee may select that is consistent with the Plan. Any payments made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section shall be a full and complete discharge of any liability for such payments. The Committee shall deduct from all payments any taxes required to be withheld under the laws of the United States or any state, including but not limited to Federal and/or state income and employment taxes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.7&#9;<U>Limitation of Liability</U>. To the extent permitted by law, no person (including the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, the Committee, any present or former member of the Board, or the Committee, and any present or former officer of the Company) shall be personally liable for any act done or omitted to be done in good faith in the administration of the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.8&#9;<U>Controlling Law</U>. To the extent not superseded by federal law, the laws of New Jersey shall be controlling in all matters relating to the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.9&#9;<U>Gender and Number</U>. Where the context admits, words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.10&#9;<U>Action by the Company</U>. Any action required of or permitted by the Company under the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or any person or persons authorized by resolution of such Board.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.11&#9;<U>Successor to the Company</U>. The term "Company" as used in the Plan shall include any successor to the Company by reason of merger, consolidation, the purchase of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.12&#9;<U>Miscellaneous</U>. The Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives, successors and assigns, and all persons entitled to benefits hereunder. Any notice given in connection with the Plan shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or by registered mail, return receipt requested. Any notice given by registered mail shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of delivery indicated on the registered mail return receipt, if correctly addressed.</P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 4</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Amendment and Termination</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Company expects to continue the Plan, it must necessarily reserve and hereby does reserve the right to amend the Plan from time to time or to terminate the Plan at any time; provided that no amendment of the Plan nor the termination of the Plan may cause the reduction or cessation of any benefits that were accrued as of the date of such amendment or termination and otherwise would be payable under this Plan, but for such amendment or termination. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Company may terminate the Plan only to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Company expect to continue the Plan, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, must necessarily reserve and hereby does reserve the right to amend the Plan from time to time, provided, that no amendment of the Plan may cause the reduction or cessation of any benefits that were accrued as of the date of such amendment and otherwise would be payable under the plan, but for such amendment. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors has delegated to the executive management Benefits Committee the authority to adopt administrative amendments to the Plan, provided, that such amendments do not involve a change in the costs or liability of the Company or alter the benefits payable thereunder. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Compensation Committee the authority to adopt all other amendments to the Plan, provided, that such amendments do not significantly increase or decrease benefit amounts, or are required to be adopted by the Board of Directors under the Code or the regulations thereunder. The Board of Directors retains the authority to adopt amendments to the Plan that significantly increase or decrease benefit amounts, or are required to be adopted by the Board of Directors under the Code or regulations thereunder.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Election to Defer</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;As a result of freezing the Plan, effective January 1, 2005, this Article IV no longer applies after such date. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.1. <U>Deferral Election</U>. (a) Prior to the first day of each Plan Year, each Participant may elect to enter into a salary reduction agreement with the Company, no later than December 31 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Compensation to which the salary deferral election relates is earned. In addition, prior to the beginning of the period to which a bonus relates, each Participant may elect to defer all or any portion of any bonus which he could earn in the following bonus period. Each salary deferral election must be filed with the Committee as directed by the Committee. Completion of such election form shall evidence the Participant's authorization of the Company to reduce his Compensation and/or bonus by the amount specified in the election. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) &#9;The election to defer the receipt of Compensation or bonuses shall thereafter be irrevocable for such Plan Year. If no election is made with respect to any Plan Year for which services have been rendered, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected not to defer any of his Compensation earned with respect to such Plan Year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) &#9;As soon as practicable after the end of each Plan Year but not later than January 31 of the next following Plan Year, the Committee will perform actual deferral percentage, actual contribution percentage and multiple use testing to determine the maximum amount of additional elective contributions that could be made for the current Plan Year, consistent with Section 402(g) of the Code, on behalf of each Participant as a participant in the Basic Plan. The lesser of the maximum allowable contribution so determined or the Participant's salary deferral under the Plan for the current Plan Year will be paid to the Participant as soon as practicable, but in no event later than March 15 of the Plan Year following the current Plan Year unless the Participant previously elected for the current Plan Year to have such amount contributed to the Basic Plan as an elective contribution. The Participant's election to have such amount contributed to the Basic Plan must be made at the same time as the
 Participant's election to enter into a salary reduction agreement with the Company under the Plan (which must be no later than December 31 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Compensation to which the salary deferral relates is earned). If the Participant so elects, the Company shall cause that amount to be contributed directly to the Basic Plan. No earnings credited under the Plan will be contributed to the Basic Plan. All such elective contributions and matching contributions made to the Basic Plan shall result in corresponding debits to each affected Participant's Account under the Plan. Any matching contributions associated with the elective contributions now made to the Basic Plan shall be in the same amounts as would be made if the elective deferrals were directly made to the Basic Plan, subject to the actual contribution and multiple use tests of Section 401(m) of the Code. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) &#9;Amounts paid to the Participant because such Participant does not elect to have such amounts contributed to the Basic Plan as an elective contribution will be includable in the Participant's gross income in the year in which the Compensation to which the salary deferral under the Plan relates was earned, and the Company will include this amount in the Participant's W-2 compensation for that year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) &#9;If a person becomes eligible to participate under this Article IV in the initial Plan Year or, if a new Participant becomes eligible to participate after a Plan Year has commenced, he may make an election to defer Compensation or bonuses related to services to be performed subsequent to his election by filing an election with the Committee. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.2. <U>Deferral Amount</U>. Each Participant for the Plan Year may elect to defer hereunder a percentage of his Compensation for the Plan Year; provided, however, in no event may the Participant's deferral under this Plan and the Basic Plan exceed more than ten percent of his Compensation for the Plan Year. No amount shall be deferred under this Plan to the extent such amount is permitted to be deferred under the Basic Plan. A Participant shall elect to defer such Compensation to his Retirement Deferral Account or his Education Deferral Account (both as defined below), in accordance with procedures established by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.3. <U>Retirement Deferral Account</U>. The Committee shall establish and maintain a deferred compensation account (the "Retirement Deferral Account") with respect to each Participant who has elected to defer Compensation to such Retirement Deferral Account under this Article IV. The Participant's Retirement Deferral Account shall be a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company and shall reflect the amount of Compensation or bonuses the Participant has elected to defer and the amount of the Company matching contribution which the Participant elects to have invested in the Retirement Deferral Account, and shall be credited or charged with the deemed investment earnings and losses thereon, if any, in accordance with Article VI. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.4. <U>Education Deferral Account</U>. The Committee shall establish and maintain a deferred compensation account (the "Education Deferral Account") with respect to each Participant who has elected to defer Compensation or bonuses to such Education Deferral Account under this Article IV. The Participant's Education Deferral Account shall be a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company and shall reflect the amount of Compensation and bonuses the Participant has elected to defer and the amount of the Company matching contribution which the Participant elects to have invested in the Education Deferral Account, and shall be credited or charged with the deemed investment earnings and losses thereon, if any, in accordance with Article VI. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 4.5. <U>Fixed Payout Account</U>. The Committee shall establish and maintain a deferred compensation account (the "Fixed Payout Account") with respect to each Participant who has elected to defer Compensation or bonuses to such Fixed Payout Account under this Article IV. The Participant's Fixed Payout Account shall be a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company and shall reflect the amount of Compensation and bonuses the Participant has elected to defer and the amount of the Company matching contribution which the Participant elects to have invested in the Education Deferral Account, and shall be credited or charged with the deemed investment earnings and losses thereon, if any, in accordance with Article VI. </P>

Each Participant shall designate from time to time, in such manner as may be satisfactory to the Committee, how the credits to his Accounts shall be deemed to be invested in one or more Permitted Investments. Such credits shall be deemed to be invested as specified by the Participant either (i) on the day following the later of (A) the date such Participant makes such designation, or (B) the date such credit is made to such Participant's Account, or (ii) on such other dates as may be reasonably determined by the Committee. In the event a Participant has not made a proper election, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected the investment funds selected by such Participant under the Basic Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) &#9;<U>Receipts</U>. Each Account shall be deemed to receive all interest, dividends, earnings and other property which would have been received with respect to a Permitted Investment deemed to be held in such Account if the Company actually owned such Permitted Investment. Cash deemed received with respect to a Permitted Investment shall be credited to the Account as of the date it would have been available for reinvestment if the Company actually owned the Permitted Investment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) &#9;<U>Disposition</U>. Each Participant may elect from time to time, in such manner as may be satisfactory to the Committee, to dispose of any one or more Permitted Investments deemed to be held in his Account.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) &#9;<U>Elections</U>. All elections to be made by a Participant pursuant to this Article VI shall be made only by such Participant, provided that if such Participant dies before his entire Account Balance is distributed, or if the Committee determines that such Participant is legally incompetent or otherwise incapable of managing his own affairs, the Committee shall have the authority to (i) itself make the elections pursuant to this Section 6.1 on behalf of such Participant, or (ii) designate such Participant's designated beneficiary, legal representative or some near relative of such Participant to make the elections pursuant to this Section 6.1 on behalf of such Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) &#9;<U>Actual Investment Not Required</U>. The Company need not actually make any Permitted Investment.

If a Participant Terminates from Employment with the Company (other than because of death or disability), the balance in the Participant's Retirement Deferral Account that relates to his deferred contributions and the earnings related thereto shall be 100% vested and nonforfeitable and, the remaining balance in his Retirement Deferral Account shall be 100% vested after completing three years of service with the Company or any member of the controlled group of companies that includes the Company (as defined in Section 414 of the Code) (the "
Controlled Group"). Such Account balances shall be distributed in accordance with Section 8.2 below. For purposes of the Plan, a Participant's "years of service" shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Basic Plan. </P>

A Participant who becomes employed by an unrelated employer upon the sale of (i) all or substantially all the assets used by the Company in the employing trade or business, or (ii) the Company's interest in the employing subsidiary, shall be deemed to have Terminated from Employment on the date immediately preceding the date that such Participant becomes an employee of the purchaser, unless the purchaser agrees in connection with the sale to be substituted for the Company as the sponsor of Plan. Such Participant shall be entitled to a distribution in accordance with the terms of Sections 8
.1 through 8.4.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.2. <U>Form of Distribution of Retirement Deferral Account</U>. Upon a Participant's Termination from Employment, the vested portion of the Participant's Account shall be distributed in the form of a lump sum on the date that is six months after such Participant's Termination from Employment, but in no event later than the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant has been Terminated from Employment with the Company for six months, or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date on which the Participant has been Terminated from Employment with the Company for six months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.3. <U>Distribution of Education Deferral Account</U>. If a Participant remains continuously employed by the Company until September 1 of the year in which his designated dependent (as defined below) attains age 18, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as possible after such September 1, and on each of the next three anniversaries thereof, a percentage of the vested portion of the Participant's Education Deferral Account. Such percentages shall be irrevocably designated by the Participant at the time the Participant elects his first deferral to his Educational Deferral Account, and the sum of such four distribution percentages shall equal 100%. If a Participant Terminates from Employment for any reason prior to the complete distribution of his Education Deferral Account, the balance in his Education Deferral Account shall be distributed in accordance with Section 8.2 above in the same manner in which his Retirement Deferral Account is distributed. If a designated depe
ndent dies prior to full payment of the amount credited to a Participant's Education Deferral Account, the balance in such Account shall be paid to the Participant as soon as administratively possible following the death of the designated dependent. A Participant shall always have a 100% vested and nonforfeitable interest in that portion of his Education Deferral Account which relates to his deferred contributions and the earnings related thereto. A Participant shall be 100% vested in his Education Deferral Account after completing three years of service with any member of the Controlled Group. For purposes of the above, a "designated dependent" shall be one dependent child of the Participant designated by the Participant who had not attained age 18 prior to September 1, 1994.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.4. <U>Distribution of Fixed Payout Account</U>. Upon the establishment of each Fixed Payout Account, a Participant shall designate, in the manner provided by the Committee, the distribution year for each Fixed Payout Account; provided that such election is made prior to January 1 of such payment year.

Any such distribution shall be for the sole purpose of enabling such Participant to meet his immediate and heavy financial needs arising as a result of personal injury, sickness, disability, substantial damage to real or personal property, or other unforeseen and extraordinary emergency of such Participant or a member of his immediate family. Children's educational expenses and the purchase or improvement of a residence are specifically excluded as events deemed to constitute an emergency for purposes of this Section 8.4. If an emergency payment is authorized, the Committee shall distribute to such Participant, within a reasonable time, an amount determined by the Committee to be sufficient to alleviate the financial hardship, but not in excess of the Participant's Account balances
 as of such date. In determining the amount to be distributed, the Committee may take into account amounts reasonably available from other resources of the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the portion of a Participant's Accounts that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, he or she shall be permitted to elect a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency from his or her vested account, subject to the following restrictions:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Committee shall have made a determination that the requested distribution constitutes an Unforeseeable Emergency in accordance with the terms of the Plan and Section 409A of the Code, and that the amount of the distribution is not in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the extreme financial emergency, plus any tax liability associated with the payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The amount determined by the Committee as a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be paid in a single cash lump sum on the last day of the calendar month in which the election is approved by the Committee, but in no event later than the last day of the second calendar month in which the election is approved by the Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 8.6. <U>Involuntary Distributions</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII, the Committee may on its own initiative authorize the Company to distribute to any Participant (or to a designated beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) all or any portion of the Participant's Account Balances. Such payment would be specifically authorized in the event there is a change in tax law, a published ruling or similar announcement issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a regulation issued by the Secretary of Treasury, a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction involving a Participant or a beneficiary, or a closing agreement made under section 7121 of the Code that is approved by the Internal Revenue Service and involves a Participant, and the Committee determines that a Participant has or will recognize income for Federal income tax purposes with respect to amounts deferred under this Plan prior to the time such amount are paid to the Participant. Not
withstanding the foregoing, with respect to the portion of a Participant's Account that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, the Committee may on its own initiative authorize the Company to distribute to any Participant (or to a designated beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) all or any portion of the Participant's Accounts only in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. </P>

Each Participant may name any person (who may be named concurrently, contingently or successively) to whom the Participant's Accounts under the Plan are to be paid if the Participant dies before the Accounts are fully distributed. Each such beneficiary designation will revoke all prior designations by the Participant, shall not require the consent of any previously named beneficiary, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee and will be effective only when filed with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime. If a Participant fails to designate a beneficiary before his death, as provided above, or if the beneficiary designated by a Participant dies before the date of the Participant's death or before complete payment of the Participant's Account balances, the Committee, in its discretion, may pay the Participant's Account balances to either (i) one or more of the Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage and in such 
proportions as the Committee determines, or (ii) the legal representative or representatives of the estate of the last to die of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<U>Grant and Acceptance of Restricted Stock Unit Award</U>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The Company granted to the Employee, subject to the restrictions, forfeiture risks and other terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, the Performance Based Restricted Stock Unit Award (the "Restricted Stock Unit Award"), which shall consist of restricted units in the amount of that Target Number of Restricted Units (defined above) (each, a <B>"<U>Restricted Unit</U>"</B>). Each Restricted Unit represents the Employee's right to receive, under the terms and conditions described in this Agreement, payment of one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock (the <B>"<U>Common Stock</U>"</B>) upon vesting of such Restricted Unit</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The Company hereby grants to the Employee, the Additional Target Number of Restricted Stock Units (defined above), which shall become part of the Employee's Restricted Stock Unit Award. The restrictions, forfeiture risks and other terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan otherwise applicable to the Employee's Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be applicable to the Employee's Additional Target Number of Restricted Stock Units. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The revised Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not be considered granted unless and until the Employee accepts the terms of this Agreement in writing. By so accepting the Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Employee is memorializing that he or she has accepted the Restricted Stock Unit Award as of the Grant Date and the Additional Grant Date. Thereafter, the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall vest on the Full Vesting Date and subject to <U>Sections 2 and 3</U>. (If the Company has no record of the Employee's acceptance of the terms of this Agreement, or any other document required by the Company in connection with the Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be ineffective and the Employee shall have no rights in the Restricted Stock Unit Award).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<U>Award </P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) &#9;<U>Award Amount</U>. The Company has determined that the Employee shall be entitled to on the Full Vesting Date one (1) share of Common Stock per Target Number of Restricted Units and Additional Target Number of Restricted Units granted. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>Vesting of Restricted Units</U>. The Employee shall become 100% vested in the Restricted Units on the Full Vesting Date, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, including <U>Section 2 and 3</U>, and shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock represented by the then-vested Restricted Units (the <B>"<U>Vested Shares</U>"</B>) (as determined in <U>Section 2(a))</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<U>Restrictions / Rights of Company and Employee</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<U>Forfeiture Rights of the Company Upon Termination</U>. Subject to the further provisions of this Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in <U>Section 3(b)</U> below, prior to the Full Vesting Date, in the event that the Employee ceases to be a continuing employee of the Company as a result of a termination of his or her Employment, other than as a result of the death, Disability, or Retirement of the Employee, the entire Restricted Stock Unit Award shall automatically be forfeited by the Employee, and shall, with no further action on the part of the Employee, revert to the full beneficial and record ownership of the Company (the <B>"<U>Forfeiture Event</U>"</B>). (The terms <B>"<U>Employment</U>"</B>, <B>"<U>Retirement</U>"</B> and <B>"<U>Disability</U>"</B> are defined in <U>Section 4</U> below.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<U>The Death or Disability of the Employee</U>. In the event that the Employee dies, or an event of Disability of the Employee, occurs prior to the Full Vesting Date, the Employee (or Beneficiary, in the case of death of the Employee) shall nonetheless become vested in the number of Restricted Units described in Section 2(a). As soon as practicable following the Employee's termination from employment as a result of death or Disability, the Employee (or Beneficiary, in the case of death of the Employee) shall receive the number of Vested Shares, as described in Section 2(a). The Employee and the beneficiary shall have no further rights under this Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<U>The Retirement of the Employee</U>. This <U>Section 3(c)</U> shall apply in lieu of <U>Section 3(a)</U> in the event that the Employee terminates employment with the Company as a result of Retirement prior to the Full Vesting Date. On the Full Vesting Date, the retired Employee will be treated as if he were employed on such date for purposes of this Agreement provided, however, that such retired Employee shall only become vested in a pro rata portion of the Restricted Units underlying the Restricted Stock Unit Award, as follows: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i)&#9;&nbsp;If the Employee's Retirement date is prior to the first anniversary of the Grant Date, his entire Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be forfeited.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)&#9;If the Employee's Retirement date is on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date and prior to second anniversary of the Grant Date, such retired Employee shall be 1/3 vested in the Restricted Units underlying his Restricted Unit Award. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii)&#9;If the Employee's Retirement date is on or after the second anniversary of the Grant Date and prior to the Full Vesting Date, such retired Employee shall be 2/3 vested in the Restricted Units underlying his Restricted Unit Award. </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;<U>Change in Control</U>. In the event that a Change in Control (as defined in the Alpharma Inc. Change in Control Plan, as amended from time to time (the <B>"<U>Change in Control Plan</U>"</B>)) occurs, the Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be governed by the Change in Control Plan and the provisions of this Agreement that contradict such Change in Control Plan shall become ineffective. For the Employee's reference, a copy of the Change in Control Plan is publicly available as an exhibit to the Company's securities filings, and is also available for review upon request.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<U>Definitions</U>. For purposes of this Agreement: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;An event of <B>"<U>Disability</U>"</B> shall mean the Employee's termination in good standing from the employ of the Company for reasons of disability under the then-established rules of the Company, consistent with all applicable federal, state and local (including international) laws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;An event of <B>"<U>Retirement</U>"</B> shall mean the Employee's voluntary termination of his or her Employment with the Company on or after attaining age 55 and completing at least 5 years of service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<B>"<U>Employment</U>"</B> shall mean the continuing status of the Employee as a full-time permanent salaried or hourly employee of the Company or another entity so long as that entity is, and at all relevant times continues to be, an affiliate (as that term is defined under the regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission) of the Company. Employment (i)&nbsp;shall include any period of illness or temporary disability during which the Employee continues to receive salary pursuant to the policies of the Company, as in effect from time to time, but (ii)&nbsp;shall not include any period of time during which the Employee is receiving salary continuation, payments in lieu of statutory or other notice, or during a statutory notice period, or other benefits as a result of the termination of Employment or any leave of absence of a duration longer than three (3) months. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<U>Issuance of Stock Certificate(s)</U>. Upon the occurrence of the Full Vesting Date and subject to <U>Sections 2 and 3</U>), the Secretary of the Company (the <B>"<U>Secretary</U>"</B>) shall promptly, upon written request, deliver to the Employee a stock certificate (or certificates) representing all Vested Shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>No Liability</U>. Neither the Company nor the Secretary shall be liable for any act it may do or omit to do with respect to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The Secretary is expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person or corporation, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In the event that the Secretary obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree, the Secretary shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction. The Secretary shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authorities or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
 purporting to execute or deliver the Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder. The Secretary shall be entitled to employ such legal counsel (which may be counsel to the Company) and other experts as it may deem necessary in connection with its obligations hereunder, it may rely upon the advice of such counsel, and it may cause the Company to pay such counsel reasonable compensation therefor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;<U>Disputes</U>. It is understood and agreed that should any dispute arise with respect to the delivery and/or ownership or right of possession of any Vested Shares or Restricted Units of the Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Secretary is authorized and directed to retain in its possession or to deliver into court without liability to anyone, all or any part of said Vested Shares until such disputes shall have been settled either by mutual written agreement of the parties concerned or by a final order, decree or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction after the time for appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected, but the Secretary shall be under no duty whatsoever to institute or defend any such proceedings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;<U>Prohibition on Transfer</U>. The Employee is subject to Section 8.3 of the Plan, which sets forth restrictions on the transferability, sale, pledge, assignment, etc. of the Restricted Stock Unit Award.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;<U>Tax Matters.</U> In the event that an Employee is subject to federal, state or local (including international) income tax and the Company becomes obligated to pay withholding of taxes as a result of this Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Employee or such other person entitled to receive such Restricted Stock Unit Award shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the amount of such withholding payment. The Company shall withhold the number of shares required in order to satisfy the withholding obligation unless the Employee tenders the withholding obligation in cash in a timely manner and with prior notification to the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;<U>Equitable Relief and Consent to Jurisdiction</U>. The Employee specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, the attempted transfer of all or part of the Restricted Stock Unit Award by the Employee in violation of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be adequate to compensate the Company, and, therefore, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any right to damages, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief from any court having competent jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&#9;<U>Employment</U>. The Company is not by this Agreement obligated to continue the Employee as an employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, and the Company or any affiliate employing the Employee may terminate his or her Employment or otherwise treat him or her without regard to the effect it may have upon him or her under this Agreement. The Company and the Employee understand and agree that any references herein to employment of the Employee by the Company shall include the Employee's Employment or service as an employee of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&#9;<U>Voting Rights and Dividends.</U> The Employee shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Restricted Units, including the right to vote and to receive regular or special cash dividends, prior to the issuance of Vested Shares with respect to such Restricted Units.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&#9;<U>Additional Securities</U>. If the Company shall pay a stock dividend or declare a stock split on or with respect to any of its Common Stock, or otherwise distribute securities of the Company to the holders of its Common Stock, the number of Restricted Units subject to this award shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights. If the Company shall distribute to its stockholders securities of another corporation, the securities of such other corporation, distributed with respect to the Restricted Units then subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, shall be added to the Restricted Units subject to the Company's Forfeiture Rights. If the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares or combined into a smaller number of shares, or in the event of a reclassification of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, or if the 
Company shall be a party to a merger, consolidation or capital reorganization, there shall be substituted for the Restricted Units then subject to this Agreement such amount and kind of securities (or cash) as are issued in such subdivision, combination, reclassification, merger, consolidation or capital reorganization in respect of the Restricted Units subject immediately prior thereto to the Company's Forfeiture Right pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, regular or special cash dividends paid by the Company on the Common Stock shall not affect the number of Restricted Units granted to the Employee under this Agreement. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.&#9;<U>Consent</U>. The Employee specifically acknowledges that the Company must use certain personal information of the Employee for the limited purpose of granting and administering the Restricted Stock Unit Award to the Employee, including sharing such information with third party administrators, and that such use may include the transfer of the Employee's personal information across international borders, and the Employee hereby consents to the use of his or her personal information for such purpose. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&#9;<U>Administration.</U> This Agreement and the Employee's rights hereunder are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations and administrative decisions that may be adopted thereunder. The Company may terminate, amend or modify the Plan at any time; provided that no such action shall in any way adversely affect the Employee's rights under this Agreement in any material way. For the Employee's reference, a copy of the Plan is available for the Employee's review as publicly filed with the Company's securities filings and with representative Company Human Resources personnel.</P>

If a Notice is delivered otherwise than as set forth above, it shall be deemed to have been given when received. The substance of any Notice shall be deemed to have been fully acknowledged in the event of refusal of acceptance by the party to whom the notice is addressed.</P>

This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Employee and the Company and their respective permitted successors, assigns, heirs, beneficiaries and representatives. This Agreement is personal to the Employee and may not be assigned by him or her without the prior written consent of the Company.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">19.&#9;<U>Severability</U>. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, but shall be interpreted as if it were written so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties waive any provision of law that renders any provisions hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">20.&#9;<U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.
