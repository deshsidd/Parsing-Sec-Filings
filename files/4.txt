                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    AAR  CORP. and its  subsidiaries are referred to  herein collectively as the
"Company," unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company was organized  in
1955  as the successor to  a business founded in  1951 and was reincorporated in
Delaware in 1966. The  Company supplies a variety  of products and services  for
aviation in the United States and abroad.

    Certain  of  the  Company's  aviation-related  activities  and  products are
subject to  licensing,  certification  and other  requirements  imposed  by  the
Federal Aviation Administration and other regulatory agencies, both domestic and
foreign.  The Company believes that it  has all licenses and certifications that
are material to the conduct of its business.

    The Company's trading activities include the  purchase, sale and lease of  a
wide variety of new, used and overhauled aviation products, principally aircraft
equipment  such as engines, avionics, accessories, airframe and engine parts and
components. The Company also provides customized inventory supply and management
programs  for  certain  aircraft  and  engine  parts  in  support  of   customer
maintenance  activities.  The  Company is  also  a distributor  of  new aviation
hardware and  parts. The  Company's  primary sources  of aviation  products  are
domestic  and  foreign  airlines,  independent  aviation  service  companies and
airframe, engine  and  other  original equipment  manufacturers.  The  Company's
trading activities also include the purchase, sale, lease and lease financing of
new and used jet aircraft.

    The Company provides a wide range of services, parts, component exchange and
other  products  as  part of  its  overhaul activities.  The  Company overhauls,
repairs and modifies components for commercial and military aircraft,  including
landing  gear and engine  components for most models  of commercial aircraft. It
provides aircraft terminal services (fueling and aircraft storage), maintenance,
modification,  special  equipment   installation  and   painting  services   for
commercial and business aircraft.

    The   Company  manufactures,  installs   and  repairs  specialized  aviation
products, including pallets, containers, cargo handling systems and  lightweight
air   logistics   shelters,  primarily   for   domestic  and   foreign  military
organizations, airframe manufacturers, commercial airlines and others.

    The Company furnishes Aviation Services directly through its own  employees.
Domestic  and foreign  airlines, airframe,  engine and  other original equipment
manufacturers,  aircraft  leasing  companies,  domestic  and  foreign   military
organizations  and  independent  aviation support  companies  are  the principal
customers for the Company's aviation trading activities. Principal customers  of
the  Company's aviation  overhaul activities  are commercial  airlines, aircraft
leasing  companies,  business  aircraft  operators,  military  overhaul  depots,
military  contractors and  original equipment  manufacturers. Sales  of Aviation
Services to commercial airlines  are generally affected by  such factors as  the
number,  type and  average age  of aircraft in  service, the  levels of aircraft
utilization (E.G., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators  and
the level of sales of new and used aircraft.

    The  Company is a  leading independent supplier of  Aviation Services to the
aviation aftermarket,  which  is highly  competitive.  Competition is  based  on
quality,  ability to provide  a broad range  of products and  services, speed of
delivery and price. During the past three years, demand for aviation aftermarket
products and  services declined  as airlines  reduced operations  and  curtailed
purchases  to counter the  impact of the airlines'  reduced traffic demand which
has not until recently  showed signs of  improvement. Additionally, during  this
period  many  airlines  continued  experiencing  financial  losses,  and certain
carriers ceased operations. Aggressive price competition among the airlines  has
led   carriers  to   continue  to   reduce  costs   and  to   defer  or  curtail

                                       2
<PAGE>
nonessential spending.  The  ongoing  soft  demand  for  aviation  products  and
services  was exacerbated by increased competition  due to availability of parts
removed from grounded  aircraft and from  entry onto the  market of  inventories
from  liquidated airlines. Aerospace manufacturers have  over the last few years
experienced reduced demand caused  by cancellations of  new aircraft orders  and
government spending cuts reducing their parts support requirements.

    The  Company competes  with other  independent distributors  and independent
support  facilities,  as   well  as   with  airlines   and  original   equipment
manufacturers,  including aerospace equipment manufacturers,  some of which have
greater resources than the Company. In certain of its leasing and commercial jet
aircraft trading  activities,  the  Company  faces  competition  from  financial
institutions,  syndicators,  commercial  and specialized  leasing  companies and
other entities that provide financing, some of which have greater resources than
the Company. The Company believes  it has maintained a satisfactory  competitive
position.

    In  addition to  its aviation-related  activities, the  Company manufactures
highly engineered proprietary products, including industrial floor cleaning  and
materials  handling equipment and nuclear  shielding material. The Company sells
these products directly and through  independent distributors to a wide  variety
of  commercial customers and  domestic and foreign  governments. The markets for
these products are highly competitive, based on price, quality and availability.

    At May 31, 1994, backlog believed  to be firm was approximately  $84,550,000
compared  to $77,520,000 at May 31,  1993. An additional $82,620,000 of unfunded
government options on  awarded contracts also  existed at May  31, 1994. Of  the
1994  year-end backlog that  is firm, $41,460,000  is attributable to government
contracts for  products  related  to  the  U.S.  Government's  rapid  deployment
programs.  It is expected that approximately  $70,523,000 of the backlog will be
shipped in fiscal 1995.

    Sales to the United  States government and  its agencies were  approximately
$77,500,000  (19.0% of total net sales),  $57,600,000 (15.0% of total net sales)
and $54,000,000  (12.8% of  total net  sales)  in fiscal  1994, 1993  and  1992,
respectively.  Because  such  sales  are  subject  to  competitive  bidding  and
government funding, no assurance can be  given that such sales will continue  at
levels   previously  experienced.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  government
contracts are  for  aviation products  and  services used  for  ongoing  routine
military  logistic  support activities;  unlike weapons  systems and  other high
technology military requirements, these products and services are less likely to
be affected by reductions in defense spending. The Company's contracts with  the
United  States  government and  its agencies  are  typically firm  agreements to
provide aviation products and services at a  fixed price and have a term of  one
year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods
of  one year  at the  option of  the government  agency. Although  the Company's
government  contracts  are  subject  to  termination  at  the  election  of  the
government,  in the event of such a termination the Company would be entitled to
recover from the government all allowable costs incurred by the Company  through
the date of termination.

    At May 31, 1994, the Company employed approximately 1,860 persons worldwide.

    For  information  concerning  the  Company's  Business  Segment  activities,
including classes of similar  products and services,  see Item 7,  "Management's
Discussion  and Analysis of Results of  Operations and Financial Condition." For
information concerning export sales, see "Business Segment Information" in  Note
1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    Aviation  trading activities are  conducted from two  buildings in Elk Grove
Village, Illinois, one owned by the Company, the other subject to an  industrial
revenue  bond  mortgage until  1995. In  addition to  warehouse space,  which is
mechanized for  efficient  access to  the  diverse inventory,  these  facilities
include  executive  offices,  sales  offices  and  a  service  center. Warehouse
facilities are

                                       3
<PAGE>
leased in  Cerritos, California  and  Hawthorne, New  York  for the  purpose  of
aviation  hardware  distribution and  in Hamburg,  Germany and  Nantgarw, United
Kingdom for the purpose of aviation part and component distribution.

    Aviation overhaul facilities  are located in  The Netherlands near  Schiphol
International  Airport (owned by  the Company); Garden City,  New York (owned by
the Company); Frankfort, New York (subject  to an industrial revenue bond  lease
to the Company until 2001, at which time the Company shall purchase the facility
for  a nominal consideration); Windsor, Connecticut  (in a building owned by the
Company); Miami, Florida (in leased facilities near the airport); Singapore  (in
leased   facilities  adjacent  to  the  airport);  London,  England  (in  leased
facilities); Paris, France  (in leased facilities)  and Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma
(in  facilities  leased  from  airport  authorities).  The  Company's experience
indicates that lease renewal  is available on  reasonable terms consistent  with
its business needs.

    The  Company's  principal manufacturing  activities  are conducted  at owned
facilities  in  Cadillac  and  Livonia,  Michigan.  Industrial  floor   cleaning
equipment  is  manufactured  in  a plant  located  in  Aberdeen,  North Carolina
(subject to an industrial revenue bond lease to the Company until October  1994,
at   which  time  the  Company  shall   purchase  the  facility  for  a  nominal
consideration) with a sales office in Bad Hamburg, Germany.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company  is not  a party  to any  pending legal  proceedings other  than
routine litigation incidental to its business.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    No  matter was  submitted to  a vote of  security holders  during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

    The  Company's Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Chicago Stock  Exchange.  On June  30,  1994, there  were  approximately  14,500
holders  of the Common Stock of  the Company, including participants in security
position listings.

    Certain of the Company's debt agreements contain provisions restricting  the
payment  of  dividends or  repurchase  of its  shares. See  Note  2 of  Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Under the most restrictive of
these provisions, the Company may not pay dividends (other than stock dividends)
or acquire  its capital  stock  if after  giving  effect thereto  the  aggregate
amounts  paid on or  after June 1, 1991  exceed the sum  of (i) $29,300,000 plus
(ii) 50% of Consolidated Net  Income of the Company after  June 1, 1991. At  May
31,  1994, unrestricted consolidated retained  earnings available for payment of
dividends  and  purchase   of  the  Company's   shares  totalled   approximately
$10,320,000.  Effective June 1, 1994 unrestricted consolidated retained earnings
increased to $15,067,000  due to the  inclusion of 50%  of the Consolidated  Net
Income of the Company for fiscal 1994.

    The table below sets forth for each quarter of the fiscal year indicated the
reported  high and low sales price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    The  Company  reports  its  activities  in  one  business  segment: Aviation
Services. The table  below sets  forth net sales  for the  Company's classes  of
similar  products and services  within this segment  for each of  the last three
fiscal years ended May 31.

THREE-YEAR NET SALES SUMMARY

    Any comparison of net sales for the last three fiscal years should be viewed
in light of the economic weakness of the aerospace/aviation industry during much
of this period. The  Company believes that  industry conditions have  stabilized
and in certain respects improved toward the end of this time frame. Airlines, in
general,  have recently experienced increased  aircraft utilization, seen growth
in revenue passenger and  freight miles and posted  modest operating gains.  The
Company  continued  to aggressively  pursue  market opportunities,  resulting in
improved revenues in fiscal 1994.

    A  decline  in  sales  of  aviation  fasteners,  due  to  lower  demand   by
aerospace/aviation  manufacturers,  offset  what otherwise  would  have  been an
increase in trading sales  during the three year  period. Further affecting  the
decline in fastener sales was the Company's election not to make significant new
investments  in inventory for fastener  programs with uncertain return potential
in a shrinking market. During this period the Company experienced an increase in
engine and airframe parts sales.

    Fiscal 1994 overhaul sales increased from the  prior year in part due to  an
increase  in  maintenance  services  at the  Company's  Oklahoma  City facility.
Additionally, sales of manufactured products  increased in fiscal 1994 from  the
prior  year  due  primarily  to  sales to  the  U.S.  government  for  the rapid
deployment program.

    The Company believes it  is well positioned to  take advantage of  available
opportunities in the improving aerospace/aviation industry.

FISCAL 1994 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1993

    The  Company's operating results improved in  fiscal 1994 despite the highly
competitive and economically  weak aerospace/aviation  market. Consolidated  net
sales  for fiscal 1994 increased $24,974,000 or  6.5% over the prior fiscal year
primarily as a result of increased manufacturing and overhaul sales. Net  income
increased  $9,211,000 over the prior year, which included restructuring expenses
of $11,000,000  ($7,200,000 after  tax)  related to  the write-down  of  certain
inventories.  Excluding restructuring expenses,  net income increased $2,011,000
or 26.9%  as the  result of  sales increases  and reduced  selling, general  and
administrative costs.

    Manufacturing  sales increased $18,287,000 or 23.5%, primarily from the sale
of products to the U.S. government. Overhaul sales increased $9,718,000 or  9.5%
due  to increased demand for maintenance  services at the Oklahoma City facility
and increased sales of rotable  landing gear inventory. Trading sales  increased
in    its   primary   products,    such   as   airframe    and   engine   parts;

                                       8
<PAGE>
however, these gains were  offset by reduced demand  for aviation fasteners  and
the Company's decision not to enter into fastener programs requiring significant
inventory  investment  with  uncertain  returns. These  factors  resulted  in an
overall decline in trading sales of $3,031,000 or 1.5%.

    Consolidated gross profit increased $3,474,000  or 5.1% over the prior  year
primarily  due to increased sales revenue. Fiscal 1994 consolidated gross profit
included $700,000  from  a reduction  in  the  interest rate  on  a  nonrecourse
leveraged  lease  obligation  negotiated  by the  Company,  and  $1,300,000 from
leveraged lease repricing  required to  adjust for tax  rate differentials.  The
consolidated  gross profit margin  was slightly lower than  the prior year, down
from 17.9% to 17.6%. Trading and  manufacturing margins improved year over  year
while  overhaul  margins  declined.  The  overhaul  margin  decline  was  due to
increased price  competition  resulting  from maintenance  overcapacity  in  the
industry  and airlines  using lower-cost  serviceable replacement  components in
preference to overhaul services.

    Consolidated operating  income increased  $16,481,000 over  the prior  year.
Without  the fiscal 1993 restructuring expenses of $11,000,000, operating income
increased $5,481,000  or  33.5% due  primarily  to  the increased  sales  and  a
reduction  of  $2,007,000  in  selling, general  and  administrative  costs. The
Company maintained its effort to contain costs, reduce nonessential spending and
create operating efficiencies wherever possible.

    Consolidated  net  income  increased  $9,211,000  notwithstanding  increased
interest  expense of $1,457,000  due to higher fixed-rate  interest on debt from
the issuance of  $50 million  of new 7.25%  long-term notes  issued in  October,
1993.  Proceeds from this fixed-rate debt  repaid $28 million of short-term bank
borrowings at lower interest rates. Higher  margins on fiscal 1994 export  sales
reduced  the  effective  tax rate,  which  also  contributed to  the  net income
increase.

FISCAL 1993 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1992

    Consolidated net sales for fiscal 1993 decreased $39,877,000 or 9% from  the
prior  fiscal year. Net income decreased $9,737,000  or 97% as the result of the
sales decrease, restructuring expenses of $11,000,000 (or $7,200,000 after  tax)
and  a reduction in the consolidated  gross profit margin. The operating results
of each major business  activity in fiscal 1993  were adversely impacted by  the
continued  weak  economic  environment, particularly  in  the aerospace/aviation
market.

    Trading activities benefitted from increased sales of its primary  products,
such  as airframe  and engine  parts. Even  with these  increases, trading sales
decreased $6,946,000  or  3%,  primarily  due to  reduced  demand  for  aviation
fasteners.   The  demand  for  fasteners  decreased  due  to  aerospace/aviation
manufacturers' reduced requirements  caused by delays  and cancellations of  new
aircraft   orders  and   government  budget   cuts  affecting   certain  defense
contractors. The  sales  of  overhaul services  decreased  $13,986,000  or  12%,
primarily  as a result of lower demand and the effect of downsizing the Oklahoma
City maintenance facility. The  lower demand was  caused by airlines  downsizing
their  active fleets and  focusing on lowering  maintenance costs. The resulting
maintenance overcapacity increased  competition which resulted  in lower  prices
and  a Company decision not to compete for certain overhaul work. Also, airlines
used  lower-cost  serviceable  components,  abundant  in  the  marketplace,   in
preference  to overhauling certain units. Simultaneously, the Company took steps
within its overhaul  activities to reduce  costs. Manufacturing sales  decreased
$18,945,000,  or  20%; however,  it should  be noted  that fiscal  1992 included
$11,000,000 of non-recurring product sales for the Persian Gulf conflict.  Sales
for  the government's rapid deployment program  increased during fiscal 1993 and
the order backlog was higher at the end  of fiscal 1993 as compared to the  same
period  in fiscal  1992. Further,  sales were reduced  due to  the reduction and
deferral  of  orders  for  commercial   and  military  aircraft  cargo   systems

                                       9
<PAGE>
and  spare parts, and  lower sales at the  Company's floor maintenance equipment
unit due to a recession-induced decline  in demand, intense competition and  the
effect of converting to a direct distribution system in Europe.

    Consolidated  gross profit  contribution decreased  $15,004,000 or  18% from
fiscal 1992 due to  a reduction in  sales and a  decrease in consolidated  gross
profit margin from 19.7% to 17.9%. Lower production and sales levels in relation
to  fixed costs at a  few units, as well  as increased competition, hampered the
margin; the  Company's  floor  maintenance  equipment  unit  was  most  affected
incurring  a loss for the year.  Following aggressive cost-reduction efforts and
an improvement in  sales, operating  performance significantly  improved in  the
third  and fourth quarters. The consolidated gross profit margin benefitted from
sales of airframe and engine parts at margins consistent with the prior year and
the effect of cost  reductions at the Oklahoma  City maintenance facility.  Cost
reductions  implemented  company  wide  during  fiscal  1993  benefitted ongoing
operations.

    The Company reduced selling, general and administrative expenses  $4,817,000
or  8% in response to a decrease in sales and competitive market conditions. The
Company continued its  focus on  cost containment and  improvement in  operating
efficiencies in an effort to maintain its operating margins.

    In  February, 1993  the Company  recorded noncash  restructuring expenses of
$11,000,000 for the writedown of  certain inventories and associated costs.  The
inventories  most  affected  were  parts  for  older-model  commercial aircraft,
certain  manufactured  products  and  material  supporting  original   equipment
manufacturers.  The  writedown resulted  from  the Company's  assessment  of the
impact on  inventories of  then very  recent changes  in the  aerospace/aviation
market,  as well as the continued recessionary environment. The Company believes
the  reduction  in  inventory  value  improved  its  competitive  position   and
facilitated sale of the inventories.

    The  income tax  benefit of $2,200,000  reported in fiscal  1993 included an
expense reduction of $1,200,000 from the reversal of income tax liabilities. The
income tax benefit before the expense reduction was higher than that  determined
using  the statutory  rate as  the result  of state  income tax  refunds and the
effect of tax benefits on exempt  earnings from export sales. The provision  for
income  taxes  in fiscal  1992  was lower  than  the amount  computed  using the
statutory Federal income  tax rate  due to  tax benefits  generated from  export
sales  and an income tax  expense reduction of $700,000.  The income tax expense
reductions were  for income  tax liabilities  recorded in  prior years,  but  no
longer  required due to  the conclusion by  the Internal Revenue  Service of its
examination of the Company's Federal income tax returns for prior years.

    Fourth quarter fiscal 1993 sales decreased  $8,009,000 or 7% as compared  to
the  same quarter  of the  prior year;  however, net  income increased $300,000.
Sales and earnings continued  to be impacted by  adverse market conditions.  The
fourth  quarter fiscal  1993 operating results  improved from  the third quarter
fiscal 1993 as  the result of  a 22%  increase in consolidated  sales and  lower
operating  costs.  Fiscal  1992's  fourth  quarter  operating  results  included
restructuring expenses of $5,800,000,  or $3,800,000 after  tax, related to  the
Oklahoma City maintenance facility.

FISCAL 1992

    Consolidated  net sales decreased $43,885,000 or 9% primarily as a result of
a cessation  of shipments  of manufactured  logistics support  products for  the
Allied Coalition in the Persian Gulf conflict and reduced sales at the Company's
Oklahoma  City maintenance facility amounting to  $53,000,000 in the prior year.
These reductions were partially  mitigated by increases  in certain trading  and
overhaul  activities stemming  from the  provisioning of  transitioned aircraft,
maintenance part  activities, and  component  overhaul activities,  despite  the
difficult   economic   environment   and  airline   customer's   curtailment  of
nonessential spending.

    Consolidated operating  income decreased  $9,671,000  primarily due  to  the
reductions  in consolidated net sales described above and restructuring expenses
of $5,800,000 recorded for restructuring and reduction in size of the  Company's
Oklahoma  City maintenance  facility. The  reduction in  the overhaul subsidiary
resulted from continued operating losses  being experienced by an  industry-wide
overcapacity  for  certain  maintenance  services,  which  led  to  facility and
workforce underutilization.

    Consolidated net  income decreased  $4,781,000  as a  result of  the  events
impacting  consolidated  net  sales and  the  restructuring  expenses previously
described. The impact of these events were moderated by interest expense savings
attributed to a decline in short-term  interest rates and a lower provision  for
income  taxes  resulting from  tax benefits  generated from  export sales  and a
reduction of previously recorded tax liabilities  no longer required due to  the
conclusion  by the Internal Revenue Service of its examination of previous years
Federal income tax returns of the Company.

                              FINANCIAL CONDITION

AT MAY 31, 1994 COMPARED WITH MAY 31, 1993

    In fiscal 1994, the Company's primary sources of liquidity were the proceeds
of $50,000,000 from the issuance of  7.25% unsecured ten-year notes in  October,
1993  and cash  provided from  operations of  $6,697,000. The  proceeds from the
issuance of the notes were used  to repay all outstanding short-term bank  debt,
thus  making available to  the Company the  full amount of  its credit lines and
borrowing facilities. The  balance of the  note proceeds were  used for  working
capital  requirements,  primarily inventory  and  accounts receivable.  Net cash
provided from operating activities decreased $10,109,000 in fiscal 1994 from the
prior year  as a  result  of new  inventory  investments to  support  government
contracts  and deposits made on  purchases of inventory (see  note 7 in Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements)  to  support  new  inventory   provisioning
contracts  entered into  during fiscal  1994. Cash  provided in  excess of these
requirements was used primarily for capital expenditures and to pay dividends.

    The Company's financial  condition remains solid.  The Company improved  its
current ratio and working capital position during the year in spite of operating
in  an  aerospace/aviation industry  that continued  to be  financially troubled
although improving.  The Company's  improved financial  condition and  available
sources  of financing,  including its  unused bank  credit lines  and facilities
amounting to  $132,500,000, will  enable  the Company  to meet  its  anticipated
working capital requirements and pursue advantageous business opportunities.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
  OF AAR CORP.:

    We  have audited the  accompanying consolidated balance  sheets of AAR CORP.
and subsidiaries  as of  May 31,  1994  and 1993  and the  related  consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in  the  three-year  period ended  May  31, 1994.  These  consolidated financial
statements  are   the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our  opinion, the  consolidated financial  statements referred  to  above
present  fairly, in all  material respects, the financial  position of AAR CORP.
and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1994 and 1993 and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for  each of the years in  the three-year period ended  May
31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As  discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted the  provisions of  the Financial  Accounting Standards  Board's
Statement  of  Financial Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No.  109,  ACCOUNTING FOR
INCOME TAXES,  as  of June  1,  1993. As  discussed  in Notes  1  and 6  to  the
consolidated  financial statements, the  Company also adopted  the provisions of
the Financial Accounting Standards Board's  SFAS No. 106, EMPLOYERS'  ACCOUNTING
FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, as of June 1, 1993.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

    The  accompanying consolidated financial statements  include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts  and
transactions.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

    Sales  and related cost  of sales are recognized  primarily upon shipment of
products and  performance  of services.  Sales  and  related cost  of  sales  on
long-term  contracts are  recognized as units  are delivered,  determined by the
percentage of completion method based on  the relationship of costs incurred  to
date  to estimated total costs under  the respective contracts. Lease revenue is
recognized as earned.

  ACCOUNTING CHANGES

    Effective  June  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of   Financial
Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No.  109  "Accounting for  Income  Taxes." Prior
years' results were not restated. The cumulative effect of the accounting change
was a tax  benefit of  $900,000 ($.06  per share)  recorded in  the three  month
period ended August 31, 1993. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 changes the Company's
method  of accounting  for income taxes  from the deferred  method of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion  ("APB") No. 11  to the asset  and liability method  of
accounting.  Under  the  asset and  liability  method, deferred  tax  assets and
liabilities  are   recognized  for   the  estimated   future  tax   consequences
attributable  to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and  liabilities and  their respective tax  bases. Deferred  tax
assets  and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates in effect for the
year in  which those  temporary  differences are  expected  to be  recovered  or
settled.  The effect on deferred  tax assets and liabilities  of a change in tax
rates will  be recognized  in the  consolidated results  of operations  for  the
period  in which the changes occurred. Pursuant to the deferred method under APB
No. 11, which was  applied in 1993  and prior years,  deferred income taxes  are
recognized for income and expense items that are reported in different years for
financial  reporting and income  tax purposes using the  tax rate applicable for
the year  of calculation.  Under the  deferred method,  deferred taxes  are  not
adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.

    Effective  June  1,  1993,  the Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106 "Employers'
Accounting for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other  than  Pensions."  Prior  years'
results  were not restated. SFAS No. 106 requires that the projected future cost
of nonpension postretirement benefits be  recognized as an expense as  employees
render  services instead of when claims are incurred, as the Company had done in
the past. Upon adoption, the Company  elected, as permitted under SFAS No.  106,
to  record a one-time transition obligation of $1,350,000 ($890,000 after tax or
$.06 per share) which  represents that portion of  future retiree benefit  costs
related  to service already rendered by both  active and retired employees up to
the date of adoption. The initial accumulated postretirement benefit  obligation
of  $1,350,000  primarily represented  health  and life  insurance  benefits for
certain current employees and retirees.

  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less  to be  cash equivalents.  At May  31, 1994  cash equivalents  of
approximately  $5,717,000  held by  the Company  represent investments  in funds
holding  high-quality  commercial   paper,  Eurodollars   and  U.S.   government
agency-issued  securities. The carrying amount  of cash equivalents approximates
fair value at May 31, 1994.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
  MARKETABLE SECURITIES

    The Company recorded net proceeds of $1,593,000 in fiscal 1993 from the sale
of marketable securities  and included a  $57,000 net loss  in the  consolidated
results  of  operations.  Marketable securities  were  carried at  the  lower of
aggregate cost or market value.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY

    Gains and  losses  on  foreign currency  translation  and  foreign  exchange
contracts  are determined in accordance with the method of accounting prescribed
by SFAS  No.  52.  All  balance  sheet  accounts  of  foreign  subsidiaries  are
translated  at year-end exchange rates. Revenues  and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates  during the  year. Translation  adjustments are  excluded
from  the  results of  operations and  are recorded  in Stockholders'  equity as
Cumulative translation adjustments.

    The Company from time to time uses forward exchange contracts or options  to
hedge  its loss exposure from the translation of foreign subsidiaries results of
operations from  functional  currencies  into  United  States  dollars.  Forward
exchange  contracts or options  losses are included in  results of operations in
the period  the loss  is determinable.  Gains are  recorded when  realized  upon
contract settlement. At May 31, 1994 there were no forward exchange contracts or
options  outstanding. Foreign  subsidiaries incur  transaction gains  and losses
upon settlement  of  obligations  in  currencies  other  than  their  functional
currency.  The aggregate net transaction gains (losses), including those related
to forward exchange contracts, reported in results of operations were $(32,000),
$(578,000) and $25,000 for fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF MARKET OR CREDIT RISK

    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of market or credit  risk consist principally of  forward exchange contracts  or
options  and trade receivables.  The forward exchange  contracts discussed above
subject the Company to  market risk from  exchange rate movements.  Accordingly,
the  Company recognizes losses in the period such losses are determinable. While
the Company's trade receivables are diverse based on the number of entities  and
geographic  locations, the  majority are concentrated  in the aerospace/aviation
industry. The  Company performs  evaluations of  customers' financial  condition
prior to extending credit privileges and performs on-going credit evaluations of
payment  experience, current financial condition, and risk analysis. The Company
typically requires  collateral  in the  form  of security  interest  in  assets,
letters  of  credit, or  obligation guarantees  from financial  institutions for
transactions other than normal trade terms.

    SFAS No.  107  "Disclosures  About Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments,"
requires  disclosure of the  fair value of  certain financial instruments. Cash,
accounts  receivable,  short-term  borrowing,   accounts  payable  and   accrued
liabilities  are reflected in the financial  statements at fair value because of
the short-term maturity of these instruments. Marketable securities are recorded
in  the  financial  statements  at  current  market  values.  Non-current  notes
receivable  and long-term debt bearing a variable interest rate are reflected in
the financial statements at fair value. Those bearing a fixed interest rate have
fair values based on estimates using discounted future cash flows at an  assumed
discount  rate for borrowing currently prevailing in the marketplace for similar
instruments.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant
market  information  about  the   financial  instrument.  These  estimates   are
subjective  in  nature  and  involve uncertainties  and  matters  of significant
judgement  and  therefore  cannot  be  determined  with  precision.  Changes  in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

  INVENTORIES

    Inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by
either  the specific  identification or first-in,  first-out method. Inventoried
costs relating to  long-term contracts  and programs  are stated  at the  actual
production  costs,  including factory  burden and  initial tooling,  incurred to
date, reduced by amounts identified with revenue recognized on units  delivered.
The  costs attributed to units delivered  under long-term contracts and programs
are based on the estimated average cost  of all units scheduled to be  produced.
Progress   billings  under  government  contracts  are  based  on  an  allowable
percentage of  the  cost of  material  received  and labor  and  factory  burden
incurred.

  EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES

    Lease  revenue is recognized as earned. The cost of the asset under lease is
original purchase price plus overhaul costs.  Depreciation of the cost is  based
on  the straight-line method over the lease term. Maintenance costs are expensed
as incurred. The assets are  available for sale at the  end of each lease  term.
The balance sheet classification is based on the lease term. Leases with a fixed
term under twelve months are considered short-term and all others are classified
as long-term.

    Equipment  on short-term lease consists of  aircraft engines and parts on or
available for lease to satisfy  immediate short-term customer requirements.  The
leases  are renewable  with fixed  terms, which generally  vary from  one to six
months.

  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

    Depreciation is computed on  the straight-line method  over useful lives  of
10-40  years  for  buildings  and improvements  and  3-10  years  for equipment,
furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the  estimated
useful life or the term of the applicable lease.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
    Repairs  and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or
disposal, cost and accumulated  depreciation are removed  from the accounts  and
related gains and losses included in results of operations.

  LEVERAGED LEASES

    The  Company acts as an equity  participant in leveraged lease transactions.
The equipment cost in excess of equity contribution is furnished by third  party
financing  in the form  of secured debt.  Under the lease  agreements, the third
parties have no recourse against the Company for non-payment of the obligations.
The third party debt  is collateralized by the  lessees' rental obligations  and
the  leased equipment. The Company has ownership rights to the leased assets and
is entitled to the  investment tax credits, and  benefits of tax deductions  for
depreciation  on  the  leased  assets  and  for  interest  on  the  secured debt
financing.

  COST IN EXCESS OF UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES

    The cost in excess of underlying  net assets of companies acquired is  being
amortized  over a period of forty years. Amortization was $240,000, $240,000 and
$228,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993  and 1992, respectively. Accumulated  amortization
is  $2,950,000,  $2,710,000  and $2,470,000  at  May  31, 1994,  1993  and 1992,
respectively.

  INCOME TAXES

    Income taxes  are determined  in accordance  with the  method of  accounting
prescribed by SFAS No. 109.

    Federal  income  taxes are  not provided  on  the undistributed  earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries (approximately  $14,600,000 and $13,300,000 at  May
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively), as it is the Company's intention to reinvest a
portion  of these earnings indefinitely in  the foreign operations. From time to
time, as the earnings are treated as  taxable in the United States, the  related
tax expense would be offset substantially by foreign tax credits. Foreign income
taxes  are provided  at the  local statutory  rates and  reflect estimated taxes
payable.

    The benefits  of investment  tax credits  are recognized  for book  purposes
under the deferral method of accounting for leveraged leases. The investment tax
credits are recognized in the year earned for income tax purposes.

consolidated retained earnings available for  payment of dividends and  purchase
of  the Company's shares  was approximately $10,320,000.  Effective June 1, 1994
unrestricted consolidated retained earnings increased to $15,067,000 due to  the
inclusion of 50% of the consolidated net income of the Company for fiscal 1994.

    The  deferred tax provisions for the fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 result
primarily from differences between book and tax income arising from depreciation
and leveraged leases.  Refundable income  taxes included  within Prepaid  income
taxes, deposits and other, principally represent refunds of Federal income taxes
resulting  from additional tax benefits generated  from export sales and foreign
tax credits  carried  back against  prior  years. Interest  income  relating  to
refundable  income taxes  was $576,000, $390,000  and $910,000  for fiscal 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

    The  balance  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  arises  from  the
differences  in the timing of the  recognition for transactions between book and
income tax purposes and consists of the following components:

3.  INCOME TAXES -- (CONTINUED)
    The Company has determined, more likely than not, that a valuation allowance
is not required, based upon the  Company's history of prior operating  earnings,
its  expectations for  continued future earnings  and the  scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities,  primarily related to  leveraged leases, which  exceed
the amount of the deferred tax assets.

    The  provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the United States statutory  Federal income tax rate  of 34.0% for fiscal  1994,
1993 and 1992 for the following reasons:

</TABLE>

    The  provision for  income taxes was  reduced by $1,200,000  and $700,000 in
fiscal 1993  and 1992,  respectively, due  to the  reversal of  tax  liabilities
previously  recorded but no longer  required as the result  of the resolution of
issues arising from the  Internal Revenue Service's  examination of the  Federal
income  tax returns for  the fiscal years  1979 through 1989.  The years are now
closed to assessments, therefore certain tax accruals previously provided are no
longer required.

    The fiscal 1993 income tax benefit before the reversal of tax liabilities on
consolidated pre-tax income was higher than the statutory rate primarily as  the
result  of state income tax  refunds received and the  effect of tax benefits on
exempt earnings from export sales.  Pretax income from foreign subsidiaries  was
approximately  $1,300,000, $1,200,000 and  $2,300,000 at May  31, 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively. Total foreign income taxes provided were in excess of  total
local  statutory rates in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 due to net operating losses
of certain subsidiaries not deductible for tax purposes.

    The  options are granted at prices equal  to the closing market price on the
date of grant, become exercisable at such times as may be specified by the Board
of Directors or as otherwise provided  by the applicable stock option plan,  and
expire five to ten years from date of grant. Upon exercise of stock options, the
excess of the proceeds over par value, or cost in the case of treasury stock, is
credited to Capital surplus in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    The  AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan also  provides for the grant of restricted
stock awards.  Restrictions are  released at  the end  of applicable  restricted
periods.  The number of shares and the  restricted period, which varies from two
to ten  years, are  determined by  the Compensation  Committee of  the Board  of
Directors.  The market value of the award on  the date of grant is recorded as a
deferred expense,  common stock  and capital  surplus. The  deferred expense  is
included in results of operations over the restricted term. The expense relating
to  outstanding restricted stock  awards was $538,000,  $610,000 and $640,000 in
fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    The AAR CORP. Employee Stock Purchase Plan  is open to all employees of  the
Company (other than officers, directors or participants in other option plans of
the  Company)  having  six months  of  service.  The plan  permits  employees to
purchase common stock  in periodic offerings  at the lesser  of the fair  market
value  on date  of offering  and 85%  of the  fair market  value on  the date of
exercise. A participating employee pays for  shares by payroll deduction over  a
two-year  period. Upon  completion of the  purchase, the excess  of the proceeds
over the  par value  (or cost  in the  case of  treasury stock)  is credited  to
capital surplus.

</TABLE>

    Pursuant to a shareholder rights plan  adopted in 1987 and amended in  1989,
each  outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock carries with it a Right to
purchase one  additional share  at  a price  of  $85 (subject  to  anti-dilution
adjustments).  The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when
certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 20% or more of  the
common stock by a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") or the commencement of
a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of the Common Stock.

    In  the event that  an Acquiring Person  acquires 20% or  more of the Common
Stock, or if the Company is the  surviving corporation in a merger involving  an
Acquiring  Person,  or  if the  Acquiring  Person  engages in  certain  types of
self-dealing transactions, each Right  entitles the holder  to purchase for  $85
(or the then current exercise price) shares of the Company's Common Stock having
a  market value of  $170 (or two  times the exercise  price), subject to certain
exceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other  business
combination  or 50% or more  of its assets or earning  power is sold, each Right
entitles the holder to purchase at  the then current exercise price that  number
of  shares of Common Stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of
two times  the exercise  price. The  Rights,  which do  not entitle  the  holder
thereof  to vote or  to receive dividends, expire  on August 6,  1997 and may be
redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right under certain circumstances.

    On September 21,  1990, the  Board of  Directors authorized  the Company  to
purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock on the open market
or through privately negotiated transactions. As of May 31, 1994 the Company had
purchased  308,927 shares of Common Stock on  the open market under this program
at an average price of $11.51 per share.

5.  NET INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

    Primary net  income per  share is  computed by  dividing net  income by  the
weighted  average number of shares of  common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during the year. Shares granted as restricted stock awards under The
AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan are considered outstanding from the date of  grant.
Common  Stock equivalents consist of the  average number of shares issuable upon
the exercise of  all dilutive  employee stock  options, less  the common  shares
which  could  have  been purchased,  at  the  average market  price  during each
quarter, with the assumed proceeds from the exercise of the options.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
    The Company  has  defined contribution  or  defined benefit  plans  covering
substantially  all  full-time domestic  employees and  certain employees  in the
Netherlands.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)
  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

    The pension  plans for  domestic salaried  employees have  benefit  formulas
based  primarily on years  of service and compensation.  The pension benefit for
hourly employees is generally based on a  fixed amount per year of service.  The
Company  follows  the  provisions of  SFAS  No. 87,  "Employers'  Accounting for
Pensions," for all domestic operations.

    The Company's funding policy for  domestic plans is to contribute  annually,
at  a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes and
that is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits.  Contributions
are  intended to  provide for  benefits attributed  to service  to date  and for
benefits expected to be earned  in the future. The  assets of the pension  plans
are  invested primarily in  mutual funds, common  stocks, investment grade bonds
and United States government obligations.

    Certain international subsidiaries also have  pension plans. In most  cases,
the  plans are defined benefit  in nature. Assets of  the plans are comprised of
insurance contracts. Benefit formulas are similar  to those used by U.S.  plans.
It  is the  policy of these  subsidiaries to  fund at least  the minimum amounts
required by local law and regulation.  Effective June 1, 1993, all  non-domestic
pension plans have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 87.

    The  following  table sets  forth the  plans' funded  status and  the amount
recognized in the Company's Consolidated  Balance Sheets. The plans are  grouped
according  to  the  portion  of the  accumulated  benefit  obligation  funded as
follows:

    The projected benefit obligation for  domestic plans is determined using  an
assumed  weighted  average  discount rate  of  8.0%  for fiscal  1994  and 1993,
respectively and  an  assumed average  increase  of 4.6%  in  compensation.  The
expected  long-term rate of return on assets  is 10.0% for fiscal 1994 and 1993.
Unrecognized  net  loss,  prior  service  cost  and  transition  obligation  are
amortized  on a  straight line basis  over the estimated  average future service
period.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)
    The projected benefit obligation for non-domestic plans are determined using
an assumed weighted average discount rate of 7.0% for fiscal 1994 and an assumed
average  compensation  increase  of  2.0%  for  the  first  5  years  and  4.0%,
thereafter.  The expected long-term rate of return  on assets is 6.5% for fiscal
1994.

    The provisions of SFAS No.  87 "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"  require
recognition  in the balance sheet of an additional minimum liability, equity and
related intangible assets for pension plans with accumulated benefits in  excess
of  plan assets. At May 31, 1994 the  Company has a minimum pension liability of
$3,400,000 reported  within Retirement  benefit obligation  in the  Consolidated
Balance Sheet with $1,000,000 charged to Stockholders' equity in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 87.

  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

    The defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended  to
qualify  as  a 401(k)  plan under  the  Internal Revenue  Code. Under  the plan,
employees may contribute  up to  15% of  their pretax  compensation, subject  to
applicable  regulatory limits. The Company may make matching contributions up to
6% of  compensation. Participants  vest  immediately in  Company  contributions.
Expense  charged to results of operations was $800,000, $430,000 and $860,000 in
fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  LONG TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN

    The long term performance incentive plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors.  The plan provides for incentive awards  to
certain key employees designated by the Compensation Committee based on the long
term  performance of the Company. No awards were earned under the Plan in fiscal
1994, 1993 nor 1992, therefore, no expense was charged to results of operations.

  SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

    Supplemental Retirement agreements provide  benefits to certain current  and
former  key employees. During  fiscal 1993 and 1992,  $260,000 and $570,000 were
deposited into trust funds for payment of these benefits. The amounts are  being
amortized  over the remaining terms of employment. Expense charged to results of
operations was $470,000, $570,000  and $460,000 in fiscal  1994, 1993 and  1992,
respectively.   The  unamortized  amount   of  $880,000  at   May  31,  1994  is

reported with Prepaid  income taxes, retirement  benefits, notes receivable  and
other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At May 31, 1994, the trust fund assets
were adequate to provide for the estimated retirement benefits.

  BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RETIREMENT PLAN

    The  Company adopted a Directors' Retirement  Plan for its outside directors
in April,  1992. The  Plan provides  for  a benefit  to outside  directors  upon
retirement  on or after age 65 provided  they have completed at least five years
of service as  a director. Benefits  are payable  as a quarterly  annuity in  an
amount  equal to 25% of the annual retainer fee payable by the Company to active
outside directors. Payment of benefits  commences upon retirement and  continues
for  a  period equal  to the  total number  of years  of the  retired director's
service as a  director to a  maximum of  ten years, or  death, whichever  occurs
first.  The Directors' Retirement  Plan is unfunded,  with costs and obligations
recognized in  accordance  with SFAS  No.  87.  Expense charged  to  results  of
operations was $75,000 and $120,000 in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

    The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible
employees  and retirees under  a variety of plans.  Generally these benefits are
contributory, with retiree contributions  adjusted annually. The  postretirement
plans  are unfunded and the Company has the  right to modify or terminate any of
these plans  in  the  future,  in certain  cases  subject  to  union  bargaining
agreements.

    Effective  June  1,  1993,  the Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  106 "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other  Than Pensions."  Prior to  fiscal
year 1994, the Company recognized retiree health and life insurance expense when
benefits  were paid. Prior years' results  were not restated. Upon adoption, the
Company elected  to  record  a  one-time  transition  obligation  of  $1,350,000
($890,000  after tax)  which represents that  portion of  future retiree benefit
costs related to service already rendered  by both active and retired  employees
up to the date of adoption.

    Net  periodic  postretirement  benefit  cost for  fiscal  1994  included the
following components:

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS -- (CONTINUED)
    The funded status of the plans at May 31, 1994 were as follows:

</TABLE>

    The assumed discount  rate used  to measure  the accumulated  postretirement
benefit obligation was 8.0%. The assumed rate of future increases in health care
costs was 10.0% in fiscal 1994, declining to 6.0% by the year 2004 and remaining
at  that rate thereafter. A one percent increase in the assumed health care cost
trend  rate  would  increase   the  accumulated  postretirement  obligation   by
approximately  $100,000 as of May 31, 1994 and would not result in a significant
change to the annual postretirement benefit expense.

7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    The Company  leases  certain  facilities under  agreements  that  expire  at
various  dates through 2011.  Rental expense under  these leases was $4,840,000,
$5,320,000 and $4,850,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Future minimum payments under leases with initial or remaining terms of  one
year  or more at  May 31, 1994  were $4,820,000 for  fiscal 1995, $3,490,000 for
fiscal 1996,  $3,310,000  for  fiscal  1997,  $2,850,000  for  fiscal  1998  and
$10,310,000 for fiscal 1999 and thereafter.

    The   Company  regularly  places  deposits   with  suppliers  on  short-term
commitments to purchase inventory. These conditional contractual commitments are
made in  the ordinary  course  of business.  At May  31,  1994 the  Company  had
$10,700,000 of deposits outstanding with suppliers.

    The  Company is involved in various claims  and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course  of  business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  ultimate
disposition  of these  matters will  not have a  material adverse  effect on the
Company's consolidated financial condition.

writedown of  certain  inventories and  associated  costs in  fiscal  1993.  The
inventories  most  affected  were  parts  for  older-model  commercial aircraft,
certain manufactured products as well as material supporting original  equipment
manufacturers.  The  writedown resulted  from  the Company's  assessment  of the
impact on inventories of  the changes in the  aviation/aerospace market and  the
recessionary  economic  environment.  The  noncash  restructuring  expenses that
established inventory realization reserves (see note 13 in Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) had a remaining balance of approximately $4,488,000 at May
31, 1994. As the inventory for  which the realization reserves were  established
is  disposed  of,  the  realization reserve  balance  is  to  be correspondingly
reduced.

    The Company recorded expenses of $5,800,000  in fiscal 1992 relating to  the
restructuring  of its Oklahoma City  maintenance facility. The expenses included
the excess  of net  book  over estimated  recoverable  value of  idle  leasehold
improvements   and  equipment,  excess   inventory  and  uncollectible  accounts
receivable, as well as  related personnel termination  costs and other  facility
reduction expenses. These expenses had been fully realized as of May 31, 1994.

12. AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES
    The  Company  is an  owner participant  in  four leveraged  lease agreements
entered into between March 1986 and May 1988. These agreements cover four narrow
body commercial  aircraft and  spare parts.  The transactions  involve  aircraft
currently  operated by major  carriers. The remaining terms  of the leases range
from 7 to 10 years. The Company's equity investment in these aircraft represents
approximately one third of the  aggregate equipment cost. The remaining  portion
of the equipment cost is financed by third-party nonrecourse debt.

    The  Company has ownership rights  to the equipment subject  to the right of
the lessees to exercise certain  purchase, renewal and termination options.  For
Federal income tax purposes, the Company receives investment tax credits and has
the  benefit of tax deductions for  depreciation on the aggregate equipment cost
and  interest   on   the  nonrecourse   debt.   During  the   early   years   of

12. AIRCRAFT LEASING ACTIVITIES -- (CONTINUED)
the  lease  Federal  income tax  deductions  exceeded the  lease  rental income,
allowing excess deductions to be applied against the Company's other income.  In
the  later years of  the lease, rental  income exceeds the  deductions and taxes
will be recorded in accordance with  SFAS No. 109. Further, deferred taxes  were
provided  net of the Company's Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) position. In fiscal
1994, the Company's  Investment in leveraged  leases was repriced  approximately
$2,000,000 for the impact of an interest rate reduction on nonrecourse long-term
debt  secured by aircraft under  leveraged lease, the tax  rate change under the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1993 and  the Company's  AMT position  in
accordance with SFAS No. 13 "Accounting for Leases."

    In  August 1990, the  Company sold a  partial residual interest  in a Boeing
737-300 aircraft currently subject to a leveraged lease. The lease term  expires
in  March  2001. The  principal  portion of  the  proceeds from  this  sale were
received in the form of a $2,000,000  note and are included with Prepaid  income
taxes,  retirement  benefits, notes  receivable  and other  on  the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. This note  has an interest  rate of 9.9%.  The note and  accrued
interest  of $3,600,000 are due  in March 2001. The  carrying amount of the note
receivable approximates its fair value at May 31, 1994.

    The condensed operating results and balance sheet financial information  for
aircraft leasing activities were as follows:

                                 AMENDMENT TO
                           THE AAR CORP. BY-LAWS


      WHEREAS, AAR CORP. (the "Company") has adopted a form of by-laws (the
      "By-Laws") and reserves the right to amend the By-Laws; and

      WHEREAS, the Company has amended the By-Laws from time to time in the
      past, and now desires to amend the By-Laws further to provide that shares
      abstaining on a vote not be counted as having voted;

      NOW, THEREFORE, the By-laws are hereby amended effective April 12, 1994 in
      the following respect:

            Article II, Section 10 of the Amended By-Laws of AAR CORP. is hereby
            amended to read as follows:

                        "SECTION 10.  VOTING.  Each share of stock shall
            entitle the holder thereof to one vote.  In the election of
            directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall elect.  Any other
            action shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast except
            where the General Corporation Law prescribes a different percentage
            of votes and/or a different exercise of voting power.  In
            determining whether a proposal has been approved, shares abstaining
            or not voting but otherwise present at the meeting will not be
            counted as having been voted on the proposal.  All elections of
            directors shall be written ballots.  Voting by ballot shall not be
            required for any other corporate action except as otherwise provided
            by the General Corporation Law."

This Amendment has been executed by the Company by its duly authorized officer
effective as of April 12, 1994 and attested by its Secretary.

                                          AAR CORP.

                                  AAR CORP.


                            A Delaware Corporation

                                  ARTICLE I

                                   OFFICES

            SECTION 1.  PRINCIPAL OFFICE.  The principal office shall be at
229 South State Street, in the City of Dover, County of Kent, State of Delaware,
and the name of the resident agent in charge thereof is THE PRENTICE-HALL
CORPORATION SYSTEM, INC.

            SECTION 2.  OTHER OFFICES.  The corporation may also have an
office or offices at such other place or places, within or without the State of
Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate or the
business of the corporation require.


                                 ARTICLE II

                           STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

            SECTION 1.  TIME.  The annual meeting of the stock-
holders of the corporation for the election of directors and the transaction of
such other business as may properly come before such meeting shall be held each
year on the second Wednesday in October at three o'clock P.M. (Chicago time), or
if said day be a legal holiday, then on the next succeeding day not a legal
holiday, or shall be held on such other time and date as shall be determined by
the Board of Directors.  A special meeting of the stockholders


*as of April 12, 1994


<PAGE>




shall be held on the date and at the time fixed by those persons authorized by
the Certificate of Incorporation to call such meeting.

            SECTION 2.  PLACE.  Annual meetings and special meetings shall be
held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, as the directors
may, from time to time, fix. Whenever the directors shall fail to fix such
place, the meeting shall be held at the registered office of the corporation in
the State of Delaware.

            SECTION 3.  CALL.  Annual meetings may be called by the directors
or by any officer instructed by the directors to call the meeting.

            SECTION 4.  NOTICE OR WAIVER OF NOTICE.  Written notice of all
meetings shall be given, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting.  The
notice of an annual meeting shall state that the meeting is called for the
election of directors and for the transaction of other business which may
properly come before the meeting, and shall (if any other action which could be
taken at a special meeting is to be taken at such annual meeting), state the
purpose or purposes.  The notice of a special meeting shall in all instances
state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  If any action is
proposed to be taken which would, if taken, entitle stockholders to receive
payment for their shares of stock, the notice shall include a statement of that
purpose and to that effect.  Except as otherwise provided by the General
Corporation Law, a copy of the notice of any meeting shall be


                                       2
<PAGE>




given, personally or by mail, not less than ten days nor more than sixty days
before the date of the meeting, unless the lapse of the prescribed period of
time shall have been waived, and directed to each stockholder at his record
address or at such other address which he may have furnished by request in
writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  Notice by mail shall be deemed to
be given when deposited, with postage thereon prepaid, in the United States
mail.  If a meeting is adjourned to another time, not more than thirty days
hence, and/or to another place, and if an announcement of the adjourned time
and/or place is made at the meeting, it shall not be necessary to give notice of
the adjourned meeting unless the directors, after adjournment, fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.  Notice need not be given to any stockholder who
submits a written waiver of notice by him before or after the time stated
therein.  Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written
waiver of notice.

            SECTION 5.  STOCKHOLDER LIST.  The officer who has charge of the
stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged


                                       3
<PAGE>


in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be
open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior
to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be
held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be
produced and kept at the time and place where the meeting is to be held.  The
list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders
entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list required by this section or the
books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders.

            SECTION 6.  CONDUCT OF MEETING.  Meetings of the stockholders shall
be presided over by one of the following officers in the order of seniority and
if present and acting -- the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice-Chairman of
the Board, if any, the President, Executive Vice President, a Vice President,
or, if none of the foregoing is in office and present and acting, by a chairman
to be chosen by the stockholders.  The person presiding over the meeting shall
have authority to prescribe the agenda for the meeting and to control the length
and order of discussion.  The Secretary of the corporation, or in his absence,
an Assistant


                                       4
<PAGE>


Secretary, shall act as Secretary of every meeting, but if neither the Secretary
nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the Chairman of the meeting shall appoint
a secretary of the meeting.

            SECTION 7.  PROXY REPRESENTATION.  Every stockholder may authorize
another person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a
stockholder is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any
meeting, voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent
without a meeting.  Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by his
attorney-in-fact.  No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period.  A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and as long
as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power.  A power may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with
which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the
corporation generally.

            SECTION 8.  INSPECTORS AND JUDGES.  The directors, in advance of
any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors of election or
judges of the vote, as the case may be, to act at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.  If an inspector or inspectors or judge or judges are not appointed,
the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more
inspectors or judges.  In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector
or judge fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made
by the directors in advance of the


                                       5
<PAGE>


meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat.  Each inspector or
judge, if any, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and
sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector or judges at such
meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.  The
inspectors or judges, if any, shall determine the shares of stock represented at
the meeting, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes,
ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in
connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or
consents, determine the results, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the
election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.  On request of the person
presiding at the meeting, the inspector or inspectors or judge or judges, if
any, shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter
determined by him or them and execute a certificate of any fact found by him or
them.

            SECTION 9.  QUORUM.  The holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of stock present or represented by proxy at any such meeting of
stockholders shall constitute a quorum at such meeting for the transaction of
any business.  The stockholders present may adjourn the meeting despite the
absence of a quorum.

            SECTION 10.  VOTING.  Each share of stock shall entitle the holder
thereof to one vote.  In the election of directors, a plurality of the votes
cast shall elect.  Any other action shall be authorized by a majority of the
votes cast except where the General Corporation Law prescribes a different
percentage of votes and/or


                                       6
<PAGE>


a different exercise of voting power.  In determining whether a proposal has
been approved, shares abstaining or not voting but otherwise present at the
meeting will not be counted as having been voted on the proposal.  All elections
of directors shall be written ballots.  Voting by ballot shall not be required
for any other corporate action except as otherwise provided by the General
Corporation Law.


                                 ARTICLE III

                                  DIRECTORS

                            CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

            SECTION 1.  FORM AND TRANSFERS.  The interest of each stockholder
of the corporation shall be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock,
certifying the number of shares represented thereby and in such form not
inconsistent with the Certificate of Incorporation as the Board of Directors may
from time to time prescribe.

      Upon compliance with any provisions restricting the transferability of
shares that may be set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws,
or any written agreement in respect thereof, transfers of shares of the capital
stock of the corporation shall be made only on the books of the corporation by
the registered holder thereof, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power
of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation, or
with a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as in Section 4 of this
Article provided, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates for such
shares

properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon.  The person in whose
name shares of stock stand on the books of the corporation shall be deemed the
owner thereof for all purposes as regards the corporation; provided that
whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not
absolutely, such fact, if known to the Secretary of the corporation, shall be so
expressed in the entry of transfer.  The Board may, from time to time, make such
additional rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with
these by-laws, concerning the issue, transfer, and registration of certificates
for shares of the capital stock of the corporation.

      The certificates of stock shall be signed by or in the name of the company
by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or
a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the
Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, certifying the number of shares owned by
such named holder, and sealed with the seal of the corporation.  Such seal may
be a facsimile, engraved or printed. Any of or all the signatures on the
certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the company with the same
effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of
issue.

            SECTION 2.  RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDERS.  For the

purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to or
dissent from any corporate action in writing without a meeting, or for the
purpose of determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend
or other distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise
any rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock, or for
the purpose of any other lawful action, the directors may fix, in advance, a
date as the record date for any such determination of stockholders.  Such date
shall not be more than sixty days nor less than ten days before the date of such
meting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.  If no record date
is fixed:  (1) the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action by the Board
of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent
is expressed; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.  When a determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders has been made as provided in this paragraph, such determination
shall apply to any adjournment thereof; provided,


                                       15

however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

            SECTION 3.  LOST, STOLEN, DESTROYED OR MUTILATED CERTIFICATES.  No
certificates for shares of stock in the corporation shall be issued in place of
any certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or stolen, except on
production of such evidence of such loss, destruction or theft and on delivery
to the corporation, if the Board of Directors shall so require, of a bond of
indemnity in such amount (not exceeding twice the value of the shares
represented by such certificate), upon such terms and secured by such surety as
the Board of Directors may in its discretion require.

            SECTION 4.  TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR.  The Board of Directors
may appoint one or more transfer clerks or one or more transfer agents and one
or more registrars, and may require all certificates of stock to bear the
signature or signatures of any of them.

            SECTION 5.  EXAMINATION OF BOOKS BY STOCKHOLDERS.  The Board shall
have power to determine, from time to time, whether and to what extent and at
what times and places and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and
books and documents of the corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the
inspection of the stockholders; and no stockholder shall have any right to
inspect any account or book or document of the corporation.
