ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGE AND EMPLOYEE DATA)

    AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as "AAR"
or the "Company," unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company was
organized in 1955 as the successor to a business founded in 1951 and was
reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. The Company is a worldwide leader in
supplying aftermarket products and services to the global aviation/aerospace
industry.

    Certain of the Company's aviation-related activities and products are
subject to licensing, certification and other requirements imposed by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulatory agencies, both
domestic and foreign. The Company believes that it has all licenses and
certifications that are material to the conduct of its business.

    The Company reports its activities in one business segment: Aviation
Services. Three classes of similar products and services are included within
this segment: (i) Aircraft and Engines, (ii) Airframe and Accessories and
(iii) Manufacturing.

    The Company's Aircraft and Engines activities include (i) the purchase, sale
and lease of used commercial jet aircraft, (ii) the purchase, sale and lease of
a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engines and engine products for
the aviation aftermarket, including a broad range of spare engines and engine
parts and other engine components and accessories, and (iii) the overhaul,
repair and exchange of a wide range of engine parts and components and other
engine support services for its commercial and military customers. The Company
also provides customized inventory supply and management programs for engine
parts and components in support of customer maintenance activities. The Company
has two FAA licensed repair stations in the U.S. to perform engine component
overhaul services which cover a broad range of internal engine parts and
components. The Company also provides turbine engine overhaul and parts supply
services to industrial gas and steam turbine operators. The Company's primary
sources of aviation products for its Aircraft and Engine activities are domestic
and foreign airlines, independent aviation service companies, aircraft leasing
companies and original equipment manufacturers.

    The Company's Airframe and Accessories activities consist of (i) the
purchase, sale and lease of new, overhauled and repaired airframe parts and
accessories for the aviation aftermarket, and (ii) the overhaul, repair and
exchange of a wide variety of airframe and accessory parts and components for
its commercial, military and general aviation customers. The Company also
provides customized inventory supply and management programs for certain
airframe parts and components in support of customer maintenance activities. The
Company's primary sources of airframe parts for its Airframe and Accessories
activities are domestic and foreign airlines, independent aviation service
companies, aircraft leasing companies and original equipment manufacturers. The
Company is also an authorized distributor for more than 150 leading
aviation/aerospace product manufacturers.

    The Company's Airframe and Accessories overhaul and repair capabilities
include most commercial aircraft landing gear, a wide variety of avionics,
instruments, electrical, electronic, fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic components
and a broad range of internal airframe components. AAR also operates an aircraft
maintenance facility providing maintenance, modification, special equipment
installation, painting services and aircraft terminal services for various
models of commercial, military, regional, business and general aviation
aircraft. AAR's overhaul and repair of parts and components also support the
sale, lease and inventory management activities of the Company. AAR has nine
FAA-licensed repair stations in the U.S. and two in Europe to perform
airframe/component overhaul services.

    The Company's Manufacturing activities include (i) the design, manufacture
and installation of in-plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial
and military aircraft and helicopters,

                                       2
<PAGE>
(ii) the design and manufacture of advanced composite materials for commercial,
business and military aircraft, (iii) the manufacture and repair of a wide array
of containers, pallets and shelters in support of military and humanitarian
rapid deployment activities, (iv) the design and manufacture of a line of
specialized protective transport cases that are used to transport sensitive and
calibrated tools and instruments, and a variety of vacuum storage containers
that protect machinery and equipment during long-term storage.

    The Company furnishes aviation products and services primarily through its
own employees. The principal customers for the Company's products and services
are domestic and foreign commercial airlines, regional/commuter airlines,
business aircraft operators, aviation original equipment manufacturers, aircraft
leasing companies, domestic and foreign military organizations and independent
aviation support companies. Sales of aviation products and services to
commercial airlines are generally affected by such factors as the number, type
and average age of aircraft in service, the levels of aircraft utilization
(e.g., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators and the level of
sales of new and used aircraft.

    Competition in the worldwide aviation/aerospace aftermarket is based on
quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of
delivery and price. Competitors in the parts supply business include the
original equipment manufacturers, commercial airlines, and other independent
suppliers of parts and services. In certain of its leasing and commercial jet
aircraft trading activities, the Company faces competition from financial
institutions, syndicators, commercial and specialized leasing companies and
other entities that provide financing. AAR also competes with various repair and
overhaul organizations, which include the service arms of original equipment
manufacturers, the maintenance departments or divisions of large commercial
airlines (some of which also offer maintenance services to third parties) and
independent organizations. AAR's pallet, container and shelter manufacturing
activities compete with several modest-sized private companies, and its cargo
systems competitors include a number of divisions of large corporations.
Although certain of the Company's competitors have substantially greater
financial and other resources than the Company, the Company believes that it has
maintained a satisfactory competitive position through its responsiveness to
customer needs, its attention to quality and its unique combination of trading
expertise, technical capabilities and financial strength.

    At May 31, 2000, backlog believed to be firm was approximately $84,800
compared to $83,600 at May 31, 1999. An additional $4,100 of unfunded government
options on awarded contracts also existed at May 31, 2000. It is expected that
approximately $84,600 of the May 31, 2000 backlog will be shipped in fiscal
2001.

    Sales to the U.S. Government, its agencies and its contractors were
approximately $132,048 (12.9% of total sales), $98,954 (9.4% of total sales) and
$83,114 (9.7% of total sales) in fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. Because such sales are subject to competitive bidding and
government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at
levels previously experienced. The majority of the Company's government
contracts are for aviation products and services used for ongoing routine
military logistic support activities; unlike weapons systems and other
high-technology military requirements, these products and services are less
likely to be affected by reductions in defense spending. The Company's contracts
with the U.S. Government and its agencies are typically firm agreements to
provide aviation products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one
year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods
of one year at the option of the government agency. Although the Company's
government contracts are subject to termination at the election of the
government, in the event of such a termination the Company would be entitled to
recover from the government all allowable costs incurred by the Company through
the date of termination.

    At May 31, 2000, the Company employed approximately 2,900 persons worldwide.

activities, including classes of similar products and services, see Item 7,
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations." For information concerning export sales, see "Business Segment
Information" in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    The Company's principal aircraft and engine sales and leasing activities as
well as engine and airframe components and aftermarket parts distribution
activities are conducted from one building, which is owned by the Company, in
Wood Dale, Illinois. In addition to warehouse space, the facility includes
executive, sales and administrative offices. The Company also owns and operates
one building in Elk Grove Village, Illinois for the purpose of the distribution
of new aviation parts. Warehouse facilities are leased in Petropolis, Brazil;
Hannover, Germany; Nantgarw, Wales; and Brussels, Belgium for the purpose of
aviation parts distribution.

    Aviation overhaul facilities are located in The Netherlands near Schiphol
International Airport in a building owned by the Company; Garden City, New York
in a building owned by the Company; Frankfort, New York (subject to an
industrial revenue bond to the Company until 2001, at which time the Company
expects to purchase the facility for nominal consideration); Windsor,
Connecticut in a building owned by the Company; Miami, Florida in leased
facilities; Roswell, New Mexico in leased facilities; London, England in leased
facilities, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in facilities leased from airport
authorities. The Company's experience indicates that lease renewal is available
on reasonable terms consistent with its business needs.

    The Company's principal manufacturing activities are conducted at owned
facilities in Clearwater, Florida (subject to an industrial revenue bond); Port
Jervis, New York; and Cadillac and Livonia, Michigan.

    The Company believes that its owned and lease facilities are suitable and
adequate for its existing business.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company is not a party to any material, pending legal proceedings
(including any governmental or environmental proceedings) other than routine
litigation incidental to its existing business.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
         (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE INFORMATION, PERCENTAGE DATA AND NUMBER
         OF STOCKHOLDERS)

    The Company's Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Chicago Stock Exchange. On June 30, 2000, there were approximately 11,000
holders of the Common Stock of the Company, including participants in security
position listings.

    Certain of the Company's debt agreements contain provisions restricting the
payment of dividends or repurchase of its shares. See Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Under the most restrictive of
these provisions, the Company may not pay dividends (other than stock dividends)
or acquire its capital stock if, after giving effect to the aggregate amounts
paid on or after June 1, 1995, such amounts exceed the sum of $20,000 plus 50%
of Consolidated Net Income of the Company after June 1, 1994. At May 31, 2000
unrestricted consolidated retained earnings available for payment of dividends
and purchase of the Company's shares totaled approximately $19,504. At June 1,
2000, unrestricted consolidated retained earnings increased to $37,086, due to
inclusion of 50% of Consolidated Net Income of the Company for fiscal 2000.

    The table below sets forth for each quarter of the fiscal year indicated the
reported high and low market prices of the Company's Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange and the quarterly dividends declared.

THREE-YEAR SALES SUMMARY

    Over the last three fiscal years, consolidated sales, before pass through
sales, increased from $782,123 in fiscal 1998 to $957,525 in fiscal 2000. Total
sales, which include pass through sales, increased from $856,637 in fiscal 1998
to $1,024,333 in fiscal 2000. The growth in sales was the result of the growing
demand for the Company's broad line of products and services in the aviation/
aerospace market, whose rate of growth declined slightly the last two fiscal
years. In fiscal 1998, most of the world's major airlines, excluding those in
Asia, reported record or near record operating earnings driven by strong revenue
growth and their various initiatives to control costs. In 1999 and 2000,
however, many of the world's airlines experienced lower operating earnings
compared to 1998 reflecting slower revenue growth and higher expenses. Certain
domestic aviation/aerospace original equipment manufacturers also experienced
lower operating earnings during the latter half of the three-year period
reflecting the overall softening aviation/aerospace market. In addition, during
the latter part of the three-year period, many airlines replaced older aircraft,
such as the 727 and DC-9, powered by the JT8D engine family, and older 747s,
generally powered by the JT9D engine family, in favor of newer aircraft, such as
the 737-300, 747-400, 777, A320 and A330/A340. The Company continues to develop
new repair and overhaul capabilities and other support programs for the newer
generation aircraft and engines.

    During fiscal 1998 and 1999, the Company's sales before pass through sales
benefited from the aggressive pursuit of market opportunities in the relatively
strong aviation/aerospace market. Sales in Aircraft and Engines benefited from
new inventory management programs and higher sales of its aircraft and engine
sales and leasing products. Sales in Airframe and Accessories increased as a
result of greater demand for the Company's repair and overhaul services and the
impact from the acquisition of a new aircraft parts distribution company during
1998. Sales in Manufacturing increased in 1999 compared to 1998 from strong
demand of the Company's products supporting U.S. deployment needs.

    During fiscal 2000, sales, before pass through sales, increased due to
greater demand for the Company's repair and overhaul services, as well as the
Company's aircraft and engine sales and leasing products. Sales in Aircraft and
Engines during fiscal 2000 were negatively impacted by lower engine part sales
reflecting fewer shop visits at a main customer's engine overhaul facilities.
Sales in Manufacturing during fiscal 2000 were lower mainly as a result of the
divestiture of the Company's

                                       8
<PAGE>
floor maintenance products manufacturing facility which occurred in the second
quarter of fiscal 1999.

    Pass through sales increased in fiscal 1999 compared to 1998 mainly as a
result of new engine parts inventory management programs, but declined in fiscal
2000 primarily as a result of the aforementioned fewer shop visits at a certain
customer's engine overhaul facilities.

    The Company believes that its established global market position, its
ability to respond to changes in the industry, including technological changes,
and its diverse customer base, position the Company to take advantage of future
opportunities in the aviation/aerospace market.*

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1999

    Consolidated sales in fiscal 2000, before pass through sales, increased 4.3%
to $957,525 from $918,036 in fiscal 1999. This increase was attributable to
higher demand for the Company's aircraft and engine sales and leasing products,
as well as strong demand for the Company's repair and overhaul services. Sales
in Aircraft and Engines increased $24,306 or 5.8%, as the Company experienced
strong demand for its whole engine and aircraft products, partially offset by a
continued decrease in sales from engine parts inventory management programs.
This decrease is primarily the result of reduced demand by a major customer for
certain engine parts due principally to significantly fewer engine shop visits
to this customer for the engine types the Company supports. The Company is
working to resolve pending issues with this customer, but no assurance can be
given that sales to this customer will continue at historical levels in the
future. The Company is aggressively pursuing inventory management programs with
other customers and building its engine parts manufacturing capabilities to
offset potential future reduced sales to this customer.* Sales in Airframe and
Accessories increased $20,831 or 5.5%, reflecting increased demand for the
Company's aircraft maintenance and landing gear and small component overhaul and
repair services. These increases were partially offset by lower new aircraft
parts sales to general aviation customers. Sales in Manufacturing declined
$5,648 or 4.5%, as a result of the divestiture of the Company's floor
maintenance products manufacturing subsidiary in November 1998, partially offset
by higher sales of the Company's products supporting U.S. deployment needs. Pass
through sales were $66,808 compared to $132,572 in the prior year. As certain of
the Company's inventory management programs have matured, pass through sales
have declined as the Company has sourced more of its customer's parts
requirements with used, serviceable parts, rather than with factory-new parts.
The reduction in pass through sales during the current fiscal year is
attributable to the maturation of the Company's existing long-term inventory
management programs, as well as a decline in the number of shop visits for the
engine types the Company supports at certain long-term inventory management
programs.

    Consolidated gross profit was essentially even with the prior fiscal year.
The fiscal 2000 consolidated gross profit margin, excluding the impact from pass
through sales, was 18.1% in the current fiscal year, compared to 18.9% in the
prior year. The reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was primarily
due to the unfavorable impact of the mix of inventories sold. Selling, general
and administrative expenses increased $6,317 or 6.6% as a result of a $4,000
fourth quarter charge to increase bad debts reserve in response to the Company's
accounts receivable exposure, which included two airlines that filed for
bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2000, as well as increased information
technology costs incurred as a result of the Company's e-business activities.
Interest expense increased $4,864 principally as a result of increased average
short-term borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2000 as compared to prior
year, and interest income increased $1,327 as a result of an increase in average
outstanding interest-bearing notes receivable during the current year compared
to prior year.

    Consolidated net income declined $6,508 or 15.6% from the prior year as a
result of the above factors.

FISCAL 1999 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1998

    Consolidated sales in fiscal 1999, before pass through sales, increased
17.4% to $918,036 from $782,123 in fiscal 1998. This increase was attributable
to continued strong demand for the Company's broad range of products and
services and, among other things, full-year sales from businesses acquired in
fiscal 1998. Aircraft and Engines sales increased $76,897 or 22.7%, resulting
from higher sales of engine parts, driven primarily from strength in inventory
management programs, and increased aircraft sales and leasing revenues. These
increases were partially offset by the impact of certain engine parts sales
which were recorded by Turbine Engine Asset Management L.L.C. (an unconsolidated
joint venture company) during fiscal 1999, but were recorded by Aircraft and
Engines during the first half of fiscal 1998. Airframe and Accessories sales
increased $42,976 or 12.9%, driven primarily by the impact of full-year sales
from the new-parts distribution companies acquired during fiscal 1998, as well
as increased demand for aircraft maintenance and landing gear overhaul repair
capabilities. Manufacturing sales increased $16,040 or 14.6%, due to increased
sales of products supporting the U.S. Government's rapid deployment program, the
inclusion of full-year sales from AAR Composites (acquired in fiscal 1998) and
higher sales of cargo handling systems. These gains were partially offset by the
unfavorable impact on sales as a result of the divestiture of the Company's
floor maintenance products manufacturing subsidiary in November 1998. Pass
through sales were $132,572 compared to $74,514 in the prior year. The increase
in pass through sales in the current year as compared to the prior year was
attributable to the addition of new inventory management programs during fiscal
1999 and late fiscal 1998.

    Consolidated gross profit increased $24,853 or 16.7%, due to increased
consolidated net sales. The fiscal 1999 consolidated gross profit margin of
18.9%, excluding the impact from pass through sales, is slightly less than the
consolidated gross profit margin of 19.0% of the prior year. Consolidated
operating income increased $12,665 or 19.6% over the prior year on the strength
of increased sales, partially offset by increased selling, general and
administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lower
as a percentage of consolidated net sales; however, total expenses increased due
to the impact from companies acquired during fiscal 1998, as well as increased
marketing support and information technology costs, which include Year 2000
compliance costs. Interest expense increased $4,073 or 28.1% over the prior year
primarily due to the full-year effect of the $60,000 of unsecured 6.875% Notes
issued in December 1997.

    Consolidated net income increased $6,014 or 16.9% over the prior year as a
result of the above-noted factors.

FISCAL 1998 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1997

    Consolidated net sales, before pass through sales, increased $192,795 or
32.7% over the prior fiscal year, reflecting strong demand for the Company's
broad range of products and services and the effect of acquisitions during
fiscal 1998. Acquisitions, net of prior year dispositions, contributed $77,234
to the sales increase over the prior year. Aircraft and Engines sales increased
$76,225 or 29.0%, resulting from higher sales in its engine and engine parts
businesses, as well as increased aircraft sales. Airframe and Accessories sales
increased $111,850 or 50.5%, driven primarily by sales from the new-parts
distribution companies, which were acquired in fiscal 1998, and increased demand
for the Company's aircraft maintenance and aircraft component overhaul and
repair capabilities. Sales in Manufacturing increased $4,720 or 4.5%, reflecting
increased cargo loading and handling system sales and the inclusion of sales
from ATR (AAR Composites), which was acquired in October 1997, partially offset
by lower sales from products supporting the U.S. Government's rapid

                                       10
<PAGE>
deployment program. Pass through sales were $74,514 compared to $44,225
reflecting strong demand of engine parts in the Company's inventory management
programs.

    Consolidated gross profit increased $39,865 or 36.7%, due to increased
consolidated net sales and an increase in the consolidated gross profit margin
to 19.0%, excluding the impact from pass through sales, from 18.4% in the prior
year. The increase in the consolidated gross profit margin during fiscal 1998
reflected the favorable mix of inventories sold and improved margins in certain
manufactured products.

    Consolidated operating income increased $21,826 or 50.9% over the prior
fiscal year as a result of the increase in net sales and the higher gross profit
margin, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative
expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lower as a
percentage of consolidated net sales; however, total expenses increased
principally due to the inclusion of recently acquired companies and increased
personnel costs. Interest expense increased $3,708 or 34.4% over the prior year,
principally due to the impact of the Company's sale of $60,000 of unsecured
6.875% Notes in December 1997.

    Consolidated net income increased $12,632 or 54.9% over the prior year as a
result of the factors previously discussed.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    At May 31, 2000, the Company's liquidity and capital resources included cash
and cash equivalents of $1,241 and working capital of $347,451. At May 31, 2000,
the Company's long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio was 34.7% compared to 35.7%
at May 31, 1999, and the Company's total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 37.8%
at May 31, 2000, compared to 35.7% at May 31, 1999. The Company continues to
maintain its external sources of financing with $153,326 of unused available
bank lines and a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under which up to $200 million of common stock, preferred
stock or medium- or long-term debt securities may be issued or sold subject to
market conditions.

    During fiscal 2000, the Company generated $10,051 of cash flow from
operations compared to $28,525 and $22,823 during fiscal 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The reduction in cash flow generated from operations was
principally due to a reduction in accounts and notes payable and accrued
liabilities during the current fiscal year.

    During fiscal 2000, the Company's investing activities used $23,209,
primarily reflecting the Company's investment in property, plant and equipment
of $22,344.

    During fiscal 2000, the Company's financing activities generated $6,029 of
cash, reflecting proceeds from short-term borrowings of $25,885, partially
offset by the purchase of the Company's stock of $10,530 and the payment of cash
dividends of $9,218.

    The Company believes that its liquidity and available sources of capital
will continue to provide the Company with the ability to meet its ongoing
working capital requirements, make anticipated capital expenditures, meet
contractual commitments and pay dividends.*

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains certain statements relating to future results, which are
forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are identified by an asterisk(*). These
forward-looking statements are based on beliefs of Company management, as well
as assumptions and estimates based on information currently available to the
Company, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from historical results or those
anticipated, depending on a variety of factors, including: ability to acquire
inventory at favorable prices; integration of acquisitions; marketplace
competition; economic and aviation/aerospace market stability and Company
profitability. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize
adversely, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual
results may vary materially from those described.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

    The Company's exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuating interest
rates under its unsecured bank credit agreements and foreign exchange rates.
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company did not utilize derivative financial
instruments to offset these risks.

    At May 31, 2000, $65,300 was available under credit lines with domestic
banks, $84,115 was available under revolving credit and term loan agreements
with domestic banks, and $3,911 was available under credit agreements with
foreign banks (credit facilities). Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit
facilities is based on an overnight bid rate. As of May 31, 2000, the
outstanding balance under these agreements was $25,885. A hypothetical
10 percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities
would not have had a material impact on the results of operations for the
Company during fiscal 2000.

    Revenues and expenses of the Company's foreign operations in The Netherlands
are translated at average exchange rates during the year and balance sheet
accounts are translated at year-end exchange rates. Balance sheet translation
adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in
stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). A hypothetical 10 percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the
U.S. dollar would not have a material impact on the financial position or
results of operations of the Company.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
  OF AAR CORP.:

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AAR CORP.
and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended May 31, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AAR CORP.
and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended May 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

              (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PERCENTAGE DATA)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

    AAR CORP. (the Company) supplies a variety of products and services to the
worldwide aviation/aerospace industry. Products and services are sold primarily
to commercial, domestic and foreign airlines; business aircraft operators;
aviation original equipment manufacturers; aircraft leasing companies; domestic
and foreign military agencies and independent aviation support companies.

  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

    The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions.

    The Company conducts portions of its business through joint venture
investments accounted for under the equity method. These equity affiliates are
primarily engaged in the distribution of certain engine parts and aircraft
rotable spares to worldwide aviation customers. The financial position and
results of operations for the joint ventures during fiscal 2000 and 1999 are not
material.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

    Sales and related cost of sales are recognized primarily upon shipment of
products and performance of services. Lease revenue is recognized as earned.

    In connection with certain long-term inventory management programs, the
Company purchases factory-new products on behalf of its customers from original
equipment manufacturers. These products are purchased from the manufacturer and
"passed through" to the Company's customer at the Company's cost. Previously,
the Company disclosed these "pass through" sales in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements and excluded these transactions from sales and
cost of sales.

    During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) No. 101 summarizing the SEC's view in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition. As a result of SAB No. 101, the
Company now believes that pass through sales should be included in sales. Prior
to issuance of SAB No. 101, the Company believed that excluding pass through
sales from sales was appropriate given the limited nature of the services
provided for these transactions. Beginning with the third quarter Form 10-Q, the
Company reported pass through sales and the related cost of sales on the
Consolidated Income Statement. This change has no impact on the current period
or historical net income, earnings per share, condensed consolidated balance
sheets, statements of cash flows or comprehensive income.

  SEGMENT INFORMATION

    SFAS No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information" establishes standards for public companies to report financial and
descriptive information about reportable operating segments in annual financial
statements and interim financial reports issued to stockholders. The Company
operates in one segment: Aviation Services. The Company's determination of its
reportable segment is based on the commonalities among the products and services
within its Aviation Services segment, and is consistent with the manner in which
the Company's management reviews and evaluates operating performance.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

    SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for certain hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company is evaluating
the new Statement's provisions to determine the impact, if any, and will adopt
SFAS No. 133 in its first quarter of fiscal 2002.

  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. At May 31, 2000 and 1999, cash
equivalents of approximately $122 and $116, respectively, represent investments
in funds holding high-quality commercial paper, Eurodollars and U.S. Government
agency-issued securities. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates
fair value at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

  TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

    During fiscal 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 125, "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities",
which requires the Company to recognize the financial and servicing assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred, and to derecognize financial
assets when control has been surrendered.

    The Company has an agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, an interest in a
defined pool of trade accounts receivable up to $35,000. The Company, as agent
for the purchaser of the accounts receivable, retains collection and
administrative responsibilities for the participating interests of accounts
receivable. Accounts receivable sold under this arrangement were $29,359 and
$25,300 at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY

    Gains and losses on foreign currency translation and foreign exchange
contracts are determined in accordance with the method of accounting prescribed
by SFAS No. 52. All balance sheet accounts of foreign and certain domestic
subsidiaries transacting business in currencies other than the Company's
functional currency are translated at year-end or historical exchange rates.
Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.
Translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are
recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF MARKET OR CREDIT RISK

    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of market or credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. While the
Company's trade receivables are diverse based on the number of entities and
geographic regions, the majority are in the aviation/aerospace industry. The
Company performs evaluations of customers' financial condition prior to
extending credit privileges and performs ongoing credit evaluations of payment
experience, current financial condition and

risk analysis. The Company typically requires collateral in the form of security
interest in assets, letters of credit, and/or obligation guarantees from
financial institutions, or sells its receivables, usually on a nonrecourse
basis, for transactions other than normal trade terms.

    SFAS No. 107 "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments"
requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements
at fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The
carrying value of noncurrent notes receivable and long-term debt bearing a
variable interest rate approximates fair market value.

    Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant
market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

  INVENTORIES

    Inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by
either the specific identification, average cost or first-in, first-out method.

    The following is a summary of inventories:

  EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES

    Lease revenue is recognized as earned. The cost of the asset under lease is
original purchase price plus overhaul costs. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line method over the estimated service life of the equipment, and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The balance sheet classification is
based on the lease term, with fixed-term leases less than twelve months
classified as short-term and all others classified as long-term.

    Equipment on short-term lease consists of aircraft engines and parts on or
available for lease to satisfy customers' immediate short-term requirements. The
leases are renewable with fixed terms, which generally vary from one to twelve
months.

  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

    Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over useful lives of
10-40 years for buildings and improvements and 3-10 years for equipment,
furniture and fixtures and capitalized software.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful
life or the term of the applicable lease.

    Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or
disposal, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and
related gains and losses are included in results of operations.

  LEVERAGED LEASES

    The Company acts as an equity participant in leveraged lease transactions.
The equipment cost in excess of equity contribution is financed by third parties
in the form of secured debt. Under the lease agreements, the third parties have
no recourse against the Company for nonpayment of the obligations. The
third-party debt is collateralized by the lessees' rental obligations and the
leased equipment.

    The Company has ownership rights to the leased assets and is entitled to the
investment tax credits and benefits of tax deductions for depreciation on the
leased assets and for interest on the secured debt financing.

  COST IN EXCESS OF UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES

    The cost in excess of underlying net assets of acquired companies is being
amortized over a period of 40 years. Amortization expense was $1,213, $802, and
$565 in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Accumulated amortization is
$6,188 and $4,975 at May 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company evaluates
the existence of impairment on the basis of whether the cost in excess of
underlying net assets of acquired companies is fully recoverable from projected,
undiscounted net cash flows.

  INCOME TAXES

    Income taxes are determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109.

    The benefits of investment tax credits are recognized for financial
reporting purposes under the deferral method of accounting for leveraged leases.
The investment tax credits are recognized in the year earned for income tax
purposes.

Of this amount, $65,300 was available under credit lines with domestic banks,
$84,115 was available under revolving credit and term loan agreements with
domestic banks and $3,911 was available under credit agreements with foreign
banks. There are no compensating balance requirements in connection with
domestic or foreign lines of credit. Borrowings under domestic bank lines bear
interest at or below the corporate base rate.

    The Company may borrow a maximum of $110,000 (available through February 9,
2002) under revolving credit and term loan agreements with domestic banks.
Revolving credit borrowings may, at the Company's option, be converted to term
loans payable in equal quarterly installments over five years. Interest is based
on the corporate base rate or quoted Eurodollar or multicurrency rates during
the revolving credit period and one-half percent over the corporate base rate or
quoted Eurodollar rate thereafter. Borrowings outstanding under these agreements
at May 31, 2000 were $25,885. There are no compensating balance requirements on
any of the committed lines, but the Company is required to pay a commitment fee.

    The Company is subject to a number of covenants under the revolving credit
and term loan agreements, including restrictions which relate to the payment of
cash dividends, maintenance of minimum net working capital and tangible net
worth levels, sales of assets, additional financing, purchase of the Company's
shares and other matters. The Company is in compliance with all restrictive
financial provisions of the agreements. At May 31, 2000, unrestricted
consolidated retained earnings available for payment of dividends and purchase
of the Company's shares was approximately $19,504. Effective June 1, 2000,
unrestricted consolidated retained earnings increased to $37,086 due to
inclusion of 50% of the consolidated net income of the Company for fiscal 2000.
The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing during each of the next five
fiscal years is $429 in 2001, $65,411 in 2002, $394 in 2003, $51,407 in 2004 and
$284 in 2005. The Company's long-term debt was estimated to have a fair value of
approximately $172,426 at May 31, 2000 and was based on estimates using
discounted future cash flows at an assumed rate for borrowings currently
prevailing in the marketplace for similar instruments.

4.  COMMON STOCK AND STOCK OPTION PLANS

    The Company has established stock option plans for officers and key
employees of the Company. Stock option awards typically expire ten years from
the date of grant or earlier upon termination of employment, become exercisable
in five equal increments on successive grant anniversary dates at the New York
Stock Exchange closing stock price on the date of grant and are accompanied by
reload features and, for certain individuals, stock rights exercisable in the
event of a change in control of the Company.

    The Company accounts for these plans under APB No. 25, under which no
compensation cost has been recognized. Proforma information regarding net income
and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if
the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value
method of SFAS No. 123. The fair value of each option grant, including reloads,
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions:

    The AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan also provides for the grant of restricted
stock awards. Restrictions are released at the end of applicable restricted
periods. The number of shares and the restricted period, which varies from two
to ten years, are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. The market value of the award on the date of grant is recorded as a
deferred expense, Common stock and Capital surplus. The deferred expense is
included in results of operations over the vesting period. The expense relating
to outstanding restricted stock awards was $1,354, $1,667 and $1,400 in fiscal
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

    The AAR CORP. Employee Stock Purchase Plan is open to employees of the
Company (other than officers, directors or participants in other stock option
plans of the Company) and permits employees to purchase common stock in periodic
offerings by payroll deductions.

    Pursuant to a shareholder rights plan adopted in 1997, each outstanding
share of the Company's common stock carries with it a Right to purchase one and
one half additional shares at a price of $83.33 per share (adjusted to reflect
the February 23, 1998 stock split and subject to further antidilution
adjustments). The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when
certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 15% or more of the
common stock by a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") or the commencement of
a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more of the common stock.

    In the event that an Acquiring Person acquires 15% or more of the common
stock, or if the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger involving an
Acquiring Person or if the Acquiring Person engages in certain types of
self-dealing transactions, each Right entitles the holder to purchase, for
$83.33 per share (or the then-current exercise price), shares of the Company's
common stock having a market value of $166.66 (or two times the exercise price),
subject to certain exceptions. Similarly, if the Company is acquired in a merger
or other business combination or 50% or more of its assets or earning power is
sold, each Right entitles the holder to purchase at the then-current exercise
price that number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation having
a market value of two times the exercise price. The Rights, which do not entitle
the holder thereof to vote or to receive dividends, replace the common stock
purchase rights which were initially distributed to the Company's shareholders
in 1987 and which expired by their own terms on August 6, 1997. The Rights will
expire on August 6, 2007, and may be redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right
under certain circumstances.

    On September 21, 1990, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to 1,500 shares (adjusted for the three-for-two stock split) of the
Company's common stock on the open market

    The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share
is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year plus, when their effect is dilutive, common stock equivalents consisting of
shares subject to stock options. The following table provides a reconciliation
of the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share information for each
of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2000.

    In January 1998, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock
split, which was effected in the form of a stock dividend on February 23, 1998
to shareholders of record February 2, 1998, and a quarterly cash dividend of 8.5
cents per share on the increased shares, which effectively increased the cash
dividend payment by 6.25%.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

    The Company has defined contribution or defined benefit plans covering
substantially all full-time domestic employees and certain employees in The
Netherlands.

  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

    Prior to January 1, 2000, the pension plan for domestic salaried employees
had benefit formulas primarily based on years of service and compensation.
Effective January 1, 2000, the Company converted its existing defined benefit
plan for substantially all domestic salaried employees to a cash balance pension
plan. Under the cash balance pension plan, the retirement benefit is expressed
as a

dollar amount in an account that grows with annual pay-based credits and
interest on the account balance. The pension benefit for hourly employees is
generally based on a fixed amount per year of service. The Company follows the
provisions of SFAS No. 87 "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 132
"Employer's Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" for all
pension and postretirement plans.

    The Company's funding policy for domestic plans is to contribute annually,
at a minimum, an amount which is deductible for Federal income tax purposes and
that is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits. Contributions
are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date and for
benefits expected to be earned in the future. The assets of the pension plans
are invested primarily in mutual funds, common stocks, investment grade bonds
and U.S. Government obligations.

    Certain foreign operations of domestic subsidiaries also have pension plans.
In most cases, the plans are defined benefit in nature. Assets of the plans are
comprised of insurance contracts. Benefit formulas are based generally on years
of service and compensation. It is the policy of these subsidiaries to fund at
least the minimum amounts required by local law and regulation.

    The following table sets forth the plans' funded status, including the
change in plan assets, and the amount recognized in the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

    The defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended to
qualify as a 401(k) plan under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan,
employees may contribute up to 15.0% of their pretax compensation, subject to
applicable regulatory limits. The Company may make matching contributions up to
6.0% of compensation. Participants vest on a pro-rata basis in Company
contributions during the first three years of employment. Expense charged to
results of operations was $1,634, $1,491 and $1,174 in fiscal 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

  DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE AND KEY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND PROFIT SHARING
  PLANS

    The Company provides its outside directors with benefits upon retirement on
or after age 65 provided they have completed at least five years of service as a
director. Benefits are paid quarterly in cash in an amount equal to 25.0% of the
annual retainer fee payable by the Company to active outside directors. Payment
of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a period equal to the
total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to a
maximum of ten years, or death, whichever occurs first.

    The Company also provides supplemental retirement and profit sharing
benefits for current and former executives and key employees to supplement
benefits provided by the Company's other benefit plans. The plans are not fully
funded and may require funding in the event of a change in control of the

  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

    The Company provides health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible
employees and retirees under a variety of plans. Generally these benefits are
contributory with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement
plans are unfunded, and the Company has the right to modify or terminate any of
these plans in the future, in certain cases, subject to union bargaining
agreements. In fiscal 1995, the Company completed termination of postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefits attributable to future services of
collective bargaining and other domestic employees.

    The assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation was 8.25% at May 31, 2000 and 7.5% at May 31, 1999. The
assumed rate of future increases in healthcare costs was 6.8% and 7.5% in fiscal
2000 and 1999, respectively, declining to 5.25% by the year 2004 and remaining
at that rate thereafter. A one percent increase in the assumed healthcare cost
trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $44 as of May 31, 2000 and would not result in a significant
change to the annual postretirement benefit expense.

    The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under agreements which
are accounted for as operating leases that expire at various dates through 2011.
The Company also leases certain aviation equipment which are accounted for as
operating leases. The terms of these arrangements are one to five years with
options to renew annually at the election of the Company. If the Company elects
to not renew the lease, the Company is required to purchase the aviation
equipment at its stipulated lease value. The Company may also sublease the
aviation equipment to a customer on a short- or long-term basis. Future minimum
payments under leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more at

8.  INVESTMENT IN LEVERAGED LEASES

    From time to time, the Company acquires aircraft under lease that qualify
for leveraged lease accounting treatment. Typically, these are long-term leases
of late-model aircraft operated by major carriers where the Company is an equity
participant of at least 20% and there is a third-party provider of nonrecourse
debt of the remaining equipment cost.

    During the lease term the Company is required, in accordance with SFAS
No. 13, to adjust the elements of the investment in leveraged leases to reflect
changes in important economic assumptions, such as the renegotiating of the
interest rate on the nonrecourse debt or changes in income tax rates. In
addition, the Company may sell options or other rights to the residual proceeds
over the book value at the end of the lease term.

    The Company's net investment in leveraged leases is comprised of the
following elements:

         Benefit to which the Participant would have been entitled under the
         Qualified Retirement Plan if (1) his Accrued Benefit earned under the
         Qualified Retirement Plan was based on 60% for the President and Chief
         Executive Officer and on 50% for all other Executive Officers (unless
         otherwise specified by the Compensation Committee at the time an

of termination of employment of the Participant with the Company and all
Affiliated Companies in the form of an annuity payable over the lifetime of the
Participant only, commencing on his Normal Retirement Date.

         3.2.     KEY EMPLOYEES. Effective as of June 1, 1994, the Supplemental

         3.3.     SUPPLEMENTAL SURVIVING SPOUSE BENEFITS. Effective as of June
1, 1994, if a Participant described in Section 2.2 or 2.3 dies prior to
commencement of payment of his Qualified Retirement Benefit under circumstances
in which a Qualified Surviving Spouse Benefit is payable to his Surviving
Spouse, then a Supplemental Surviving Spouse Benefit is payable to his Surviving
Spouse in a lump sum amount equal to the lump sum amount that would have been
payable to the Participant at Normal Retirement Age, present dollar valued to
the date of Participant's death, using the interest rate assumption then in
effect under the AAR CORP. Retirement Plan. The Supplemental Surviving Spouse
Benefit shall be paid to the Surviving Spouse within 45 days of the death of the
Participant.

         3.4.     FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT. The Supplemental
Retirement Benefit payable to a Participant shall be paid in the same form under
which the Qualified Retirement Benefit is payable to the Participant. The
Participant's election under the Qualified Retirement Plan of any optional form
of payment of his Qualified Retirement Benefit (with the valid consent of his
Surviving Spouse where required under the Qualified Retirement Plan) shall also
be applicable to the payment of his Supplemental Retirement Benefit. If paid in
a lump sum, the lump sum amount shall be the actuarial value of the annuity
benefit over the lifetime of the Participant based on the mortality and interest
rate assumptions then in effect for the AAR CORP. Retirement Plan, present
dollar valued to the date of payment.

the Supplemental Retirement Benefit to a Participant shall commence on the same
date as payment of the Qualified Retirement Benefit to the Participant
commences. Any election under the Qualified Retirement Plan made by the
Participant with respect to the commencement of payment of his Qualified
Retirement Benefit shall also be applicable with respect to the commencement of
payment of his Supplemental Retirement Benefit.

Sections 3.4 and 3.5 above, an election made by the Participant under the
Qualified Retirement Plan with respect to the form of payment of his Qualified
Retirement Benefit (with the valid consent of his Surviving Spouse where
required under the Qualified Retirement Plan), or the date for commencement of
payment thereof, shall not be effective with respect to the form of payment or
date for commencement of payment of his Supplemental Retirement Benefit
hereunder unless such election is expressly approved in writing by the Company
with respect to his Supplemental Retirement Benefit. If the Company shall not
approve such election in writing, then the form of payment or date for
commencement of payment of the Participant's Supplemental Retirement Benefit
shall be selected by the Company in its sole discretion.

         3.7.     EQUIVALENCIES. A Supplemental Retirement Benefit that is
payable in any form other than an annuity over the lifetime of the Participant
only, or that commences at any time prior to the Participant's Normal Retirement
Date, shall be the equivalent of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit determined
pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 above,


                                       6

as applicable, based upon the same adjustments and assumptions as those

amount of the Qualified Retirement Benefit or the date for commencement of
payment thereunder.

         Participant at the same time as Qualified Company Contributions are
         made for such Plan Year.

<PAGE>

         Supplemental Company Account and his Supplemental Profit Sharing
         Account, any remaining amount shall be distributed to his beneficiary
         designated under the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan. If a Participant
         has not designated a beneficiary under the Qualified Profit Sharing
         Plan, or if no designated beneficiary is living on the date of
         distribution hereunder, amounts distributable pursuant to this
         paragraph shall be distributed to those persons or entities entitled to
         receive distributions of the Participant's accounts under the Qualified
         Profit Sharing Plan.

                  (c)      HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTION. A Participant shall be

         Company and all Affiliated Companies, in order to satisfy a hardship as
         defined under the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan. The amount of a
         hardship distribution, and the procedures for requesting and receiving
         such a distribution, shall satisfy the requirements set forth in the
         Qualified Profit Sharing Plan with respect to a hardship distribution
         from his Qualified Salary Deferral Account. A request for a hardship
         distribution pursuant to this paragraph shall be made separate and
         apart from a request for a hardship distribution under the Qualified
         Profit Sharing Plan, and a request for a hardship distribution under
         the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan shall not automatically be deemed a
         request for a hardship distribution hereunder.

                  (d)      TIME AND METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION. All amounts
         distributable under this Article IV to a Participant, or to his
         beneficiary in the event of his death, shall be distributed in the same
         manner and at the same time as is applicable to the distribution of the
         Participant's accounts under the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan
         following his termination of employment with the Company and all
         Affiliated Companies for any reason including death. Notwithstanding
         the preceding sentence, an election made by a Participant under the
         Qualified Profit Sharing Plan with respect to the form of distribution
         of his accounts thereunder following termination of employment, or the
         date for commencement of payment thereof, shall not be effective with
         respect to the form of payment or date for commencement of payment of
         his accounts pursuant to this Article IV, unless such election is
         expressly approved in writing by the Company. If the Company shall not
         approve such election in writing, the form of payment or date for
         commencement of payment under this Article shall be selected by the
         Company in its sole discretion. If a Participant does not elect a time
         or form of distribution under this Article, such distribution shall be
         made at the same time and in the same method as is applicable to
         distributions made with respect to his accounts under the Qualified
         Profit Sharing Plan. In no event may a Participant borrow amounts
         credited to the accounts maintained for him pursuant to this Article
         IV.

term of employment, provided that the foregoing provision shall not be deemed to
prohibit the Participant from purchasing for investment any securities or
interest in any publicly-owned organization which is competitive with the
business of the Company and its Affiliated Companies, so long as the
Participant's investment in such organization does not exceed the lesser of one
percent of its total outstanding equity securities or Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000); (b) solicit in connection with any activity which is
competitive with any of the businesses of the Company and its Affiliated
Companies, any customers or suppliers of the Company and its Affiliated

solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee or induce any customer or supplier
of the Company or any of its Affiliated Companies to terminate or materially
change such relationship.

the Company under circumstances which trigger Change in Control employment
termination benefits under the change in control provisions of an employment
agreement or severance and change in control agreement between the Participant
and the Company, the provisions of subsections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 above shall be
deemed waived by the Company and null and void.

         6.2.     GENERAL POWERS OF ADMINISTRATION. All provisions set forth in
the Qualified Retirement Plan with respect to the administrative powers and
duties of the Committee, expenses of administration, and procedures for filing
claims, shall also be applicable with respect to the Plan. The Committee shall
be entitled to rely conclusively upon all tables, valuations, certificates,
opinions and reports furnished by any actuary, accountant, controller, counsel
or other person employed or engaged by the Committee with respect to the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                            AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION

         7.1.     AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. The Company intends the Plan to be
permanent but reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan when, in the
sole opinion of the Company, such amendment or termination is advisable. Any
such amendment or termination shall be made pursuant to a resolution of the
Board and shall be effective as of the date of such resolution or such later
date as the resolution may expressly state.

         7.2      EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. No amendment or
termination of the Plan shall (i) directly or indirectly deprive any current or
former Participant or Surviving Spouse of all or any portion of any Supplemental
Retirement Benefit or Supplemental Surviving Spouse Benefit, the right to which
has accrued prior to the effective date of such amendment or termination, or
which would be payable if the Participant terminated employment for any reason,
including death, on such effective date, or (ii) directly or indirectly reduce
the balance of any Supplemental Salary Deferral Account, Supplemental Company
Account or Supplemental Profit Sharing Account held hereunder as of the
effective date of such amendment or termination. Upon termination of the Plan,
distribution of Supplemental Retirement Benefits and Supplemental Surviving
Spouse Benefits, and of amounts in Supplemental Salary Deferral Accounts,
Supplemental Company Accounts and Supplemental Profit Sharing Accounts shall be
made to Participants, their Surviving Spouses or beneficiaries in the manner and
at the time described in Sections 3.4 through 3.8 and 4.6(d) of the Plan. No
additional Supplemental Retirement Benefits or Supplemental Surviving Spouse
Benefits shall be earned after termination of the Plan, and no additional
credits of Supplemental Salary Reduction Contributions, Supplemental Company
Contributions or Supplemental Profit Sharing Contributions shall be made to the
accounts of Participants after termination of the Plan, but the Company shall
continue to credit gains and losses to accounts pursuant to Section 4.5 until
the balances of such accounts have been fully distributed to Participants or
their beneficiaries.

         7.3      EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL. Notwithstanding subsections 7.1
and 7.2 above, in the event of a Change in Control, (i) the SKERP shall continue
in effect as to any Participant's or Participant's Surviving Spouse who is a
Participant or Participant's Surviving Spouse immediately prior to a Change in
Control, and (ii) no amendment to or termination of the Plan shall be effective
as to any such Participant or Surviving Spouse to the extent the effect of such
amendment or termination would be to reduce such Participant's or Participant's
Surviving Spouse benefits or rights under the Plan from those available to
Participant under the Plan immediately prior to any such amendment


                                       12

or termination.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         8.1.     PARTICIPANTS' RIGHTS UNSECURED. Except as set forth in Section
8.2, the Plan at all times shall be entirely unfunded and no provision shall at
any time be made with respect to segregating any assets of the Company or an
Affiliated Company for payment of any benefits hereunder. The right of a
Participant or his Surviving Spouse or beneficiary to receive a benefit
hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company,
and neither the Participant nor a Surviving Spouse or beneficiary shall have any
rights in or against any specific assets of the Company or any Affiliated
Company. All amounts credited to Supplemental Salary Deferral Accounts,
Supplemental Company Accounts and Supplemental Profit Sharing Accounts of
Participants shall constitute general assets of the Company.

         8.2.     TRUST AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
8.1, the Company, promptly after the Plan effective date, shall enter into a
trust agreement ("Trust Agreement") with a bank or trust company (with a
combined capital and surplus in excess of $100 million dollars), located in the
Continental United States, as trustee, whereby the Company shall agree to
contribute to a trust ("Trust") initially and annually thereafter, for the
purpose of accumulating assets actuarially sufficient to satisfy accrued
obligations to Participants and Surviving Spouses under Article III hereof, in
the event of a Change in Control of the Company. The Trust Agreement shall
obligate the Company to make contributions sufficient to satisfy the obligations
to Participants, and Surviving Spouses under Article III hereof; provided,
however, that such initial contribution shall be made within 10 days after the
date the Board, in its discretion, deems a change in control of the Company
likely to occur. The discretion of the Board shall be binding and conclusive
with respect to the likelihood of a Change in Control of the Company to occur.
Such Trust Agreement shall be substantially in the form of the model trust
agreement set forth in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 92-64, or any
subsequent Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure, and shall include
provisions required in such model trust agreement that all assets of the Trust
shall be subject to the creditors of the Company in the event of insolvency.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.1, the Company on or as soon as
practicable after January 1, 1996, shall enter into a Trust Agreement ("Trust
Agreement No. 2") with a bank or trust company (with a combined capital and
surplus in excess of $100,000,000) located in the continental United States as
Trustee, whereby the Company shall agree to contribute to a trust ("Trust No.
2") initially and annually thereafter for the purpose of accumulating assets
sufficient to provide for Supplemental Salary Deferral Contributions,
Supplemental Company Contributions and Supplemental Profit Sharing Contributions
with respect to Participants under Article IV hereof. Trust Agreement No. 2
shall be substantially in the form of the model trust agreement set forth in
Internal Revenue Service Procedure 92-64, or any subsequent Internal Revenue
Service Procedure, and shall include provisions required in such model trust
agreement that all assets of Trust No. 2 shall be subject to the creditors of
the Company in the event of insolvency. Trust Agreement No. 2 shall include such
provisions as are applicable with respect to the investment and reinvestment of
such Contributions pursuant to directions


                                       13
<PAGE>

given by Participants to the Company and transmitted by the Company to the
Trustee of Trust Agreement No. 2 pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 4.5.

         8.3.     GENERAL CONDITIONS. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all terms and conditions of the Qualified Retirement Plan applicable to
a Qualified Retirement Benefit, or a Qualified Surviving Spouse Benefit, shall
also be applicable to a Supplemental Retirement Benefit or a Supplemental
Surviving Spouse Benefit payable hereunder, and all terms and conditions of the
Qualified Profit Sharing Plan applicable to a Qualified Salary Deferral
Contribution, a Qualified Company Contribution or a Qualified Profit Sharing
Contribution shall also be applicable to a Supplemental Salary Deferral
Contribution, Supplemental Company Contribution or Supplemental Profit Sharing
Contribution to be made hereunder. Any Qualified Retirement Benefit or Qualified
Surviving Spouse Benefit or any other benefit payable under the Qualified
Retirement Plan shall be paid solely in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Qualified Retirement Plan, any Qualified Salary Deferral Contribution,
Qualified Company Contribution or Qualified Profit Sharing Contribution, or any
other contribution to be made under the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan shall be
made solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Qualified Profit
Sharing Plan, and nothing in this Plan shall operate or be construed in any way
to modify, amend or affect the terms and provisions of the Qualified Retirement
Plan or the Qualified Profit Sharing Plan.

         8.4.     NO GUARANTY OF BENEFITS. Nothing contained in the Plan shall
constitute a guaranty by the Company, any Affiliated Company, or any other
person or entity that the assets of the Company or any Affiliated Company will
be sufficient to pay any benefit hereunder. No Participant, Surviving Spouse or
beneficiary shall have any right to receive a benefit or a distribution of
contributions under the Plan except in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

         8.5      NO ENLARGEMENT OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS. Establishment of the Plan
shall not be construed to give any Participant the right to be retained in the
service of the Company or any Affiliated Company.

         8.6.     SPENDTHRIFT PROVISION. No interest of any person or entity in,
or right to receive a distribution under, the Plan shall be subject in any
manner to sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other
alienation or encumbrance of any kind; nor may such interest or right to receive
a distribution be taken, either voluntarily or involuntarily for the
satisfaction of the debts of, or other obligations or claims against, such
person or entity, including claims for alimony, support, separate maintenance
and claims in bankruptcy proceedings.

         8.7      APPLICABLE LAW. The Plan shall be construed and administered
under the laws of the State of Illinois except to the extent preempted by
federal law.

         8.8.     SMALL BENEFITS. If the actuarial value of any Supplemental
Retirement Benefit or Supplemental Surviving Spouse Benefit is less than $5,000,
the Company may pay the actuarial value of such Benefit to the Participant or
Surviving Spouse in a single lump sum in lieu of any further Benefit payments
hereunder.


                                       14
<PAGE>

         8.9.     INCAPACITY OF RECIPIENT. If any person entitled to a payment
under the Plan is deemed by the Company to be incapable of personally receiving
and giving a valid receipt for such payment, then, unless and until claim
therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or other legal
representative of such person, the Company may provide for such payment or any
part thereof to be made to any other person or institution then contributing
toward or providing for the care and maintenance of such person. Any such
payment shall be a payment for the account of such person and a complete
discharge of any liability of the Company and the Plan therefor.

         8.10.    CORPORATE SUCCESSORS. The Plan shall be continued, following a
transfer or sale of assets of the Company, or following the merger or
consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation or entity, by
the transferee, purchaser or successor entity, unless the Plan has been
terminated by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, prior to
the effective date of such transaction.

         8.11.    UNCLAIMED BENEFIT. Each Participant, Surviving Spouse or
beneficiary shall keep the Company informed of his current address. The Company
shall not be obligated to search for the whereabouts of any person. If the
location of a Participant is not made known to the Company within three years
after the date on which payment of the Participant's benefits under the Plan may
first be made, payment may be made as though the Participant had died at the end
of the three-year period. If, within one additional year after such three-year
period has elapsed, or, within three years after the actual death of a
Participant, the Company is unable to locate any Surviving Spouse or beneficiary
of the Participant, then the Company shall have no further obligation to pay any
benefit hereunder to such Participant, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary or any
other person and such benefit shall be irrevocably forfeited.

         8.12.    LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. Notwithstanding any of the preceding
provisions of the Plan, none of the Company, any Affiliated Company, any member
of the Committee, nor any individual acting as an employee or agent of the
Company, any Affiliated Company or the Committee, shall be liable to any
Participant, former Participant, Surviving Spouse or any other beneficiary or
other person for any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred by such
Participant, Surviving Spouse or other beneficiary or other person in connection
with the Plan.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Plan has been executed this 4th day of May,
2000.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT*

                  This Amended and Restated Employment Agreement ("Agreement")
                  made and entered into as of the 14th day of July, 1998, by and
                  between AAR CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein set forth, the

hereby accepts employment by the Company, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereinafter set forth.

         2.       TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the date
hereof and, unless earlier terminated as hereinafter provided, shall end on May
31, 1997, subject to extension as follows:

         On each day after May 31, 1994, while the Employee continues in

         3.       DUTIES.

                  (a)      Employee shall have the title, duties and

* including Amendment 4 (Amended and Restated Employment Agreement)

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Employee agrees to do and perform all such acts and
duties faithfully and diligently and to furnish such services as the Chairman of
the Board may from time to time direct, and do and perform all acts in the
ordinary course of business of the Company (within such limits as the Company
may prescribe) necessary and conducive to the best interest of the Company.

                  (c)      Employee agrees to devote his full time, energy and
skill to the business of the Company and to the promotion of the best interests
of the Company and the performance of his duties as President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company; provided that the Employee shall not (to the
extent not inconsistent with paragraphs 3(d) and 10(b) below) be prevented from
(a) serving as a director of any corporation consented to in advance by
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, (b) engaging in charitable,
religious, civic or other non-profit community activities, or (c) investing his
personal assets in such form or manner as will not require any substantial
services on his part in the operation or affairs of the business in which such
investments are made which would detract from or interfere or cause a conflict
of interest with performance of his duties hereunder.

                  (d)      Employee agrees to observe policies and procedures of
the Company in effect from time to time applicable to employees of the Company
including, without limitation, policies with respect to employee loyalty and
prohibited conflicts of interest.

         4.       COMPENSATION. The Company shall pay to Employee, for all
services to be performed by Employee an annual base salary ("Base Salary") at
the rate of Six Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($650,000.00) per fiscal year,
or such greater amount as may be authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Company, in its sole discretion upon annual review during the term of
employment, payable in periodic installments in accordance with the Company's
payroll practice in effect from time to time and prorated for any portion of
a fiscal year (Company's fiscal year currently being the period from June 1
of each year through May 31 of the following year).

         5.       INCENTIVE BONUS PAYMENTS. In addition to the Base Salary
described above, Employee will continue to participate in and receive payments
under such incentive bonus programs as the Company, in its sole discretion, may
authorize from time to time for Employee and other executive officers of the
Company; provided, however, Employee will be entitled to the following during
the term of this Employment Agreement:

                  (a)      ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY INCENTIVE BONUS OPPORTUNITY.
Employee will have a graduated annual incentive bonus opportunity of up to 100%
of base salary for performance at or below target and up to an additional 50% of
base salary for performance in excess of target. Performance will be measured
against annual financial targets approved by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. Eighty percent (80%) of any bonus granted under this
subsection will be paid in cash


                                       2
<PAGE>

and the balance will be paid in restricted stock awards subject to the Company's
qualified Stock Benefit Plan (valued at NYSE closing price on date of grant).
Thirty-three and one third percent (33 1/3%) of each such restricted stock award
shall vest on the successive anniversary dates of the respective award over a
three year period based solely on the passage of time unless employment is
terminated voluntarily by the Employee in violation of this Agreement or by the
Company for Cause.

         The cash portion of the incentive bonus payable under this subsection
will be paid within 45 days of the end of each fiscal year; the restricted stock
shall have a grant date of May 31 of the year granted.

                  (b)      LONG TERM INCENTIVE BONUS AWARDS. Employee will
receive restricted stock awards, stock option grants and performance shares of
stock in the Company in accordance with appendix (i) hereto, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

         6.       VACATION AND FRINGE BENEFITS. Employee will accrue vacation in
accordance with the Company's policy in effect from time to time for other
executive officers; provided that no decrease in vacation benefits from those
available on the date hereof shall be applicable to Employee during the term
hereof. Employee shall be entitled to participate, according to eligibility
provisions of each, in such medical, life and disability insurance programs,
profit sharing plans, retirement plans and in other fringe benefit plans as may
be in effect from time to time during the term hereof and available to other
executive officers of the Company.

         7.       CLUB DUES AND BUSINESS EXPENSES. During the term hereof,
Employee will be entitled to reimbursement for normal travel and business
expenses in accordance with applicable Company policy, and will be reimbursed
membership dues in the Green Acres Country Club, the Standard Club and such
professional clubs/organizations that are appropriate and conducive to the
performance of his duties.

         8.       PROFESSIONAL FEES. The Company will reimburse Employee for
professional financial planning and income tax preparation assistance expenses
actually incurred in an amount not to exceed $5,000/year during the term hereof.

         9.       TERMINATION.

                  (a)      The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time
for Cause. Any such termination will be by majority action of the Board of
Directors (with Employee's vote disregarded) taken at a regular or specially
called meeting of the Board, after a minimum 10 day notice thereof to Employee,
with termination of this Agreement listed as an agenda item. Employee will be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at such meeting with his attorney
present if Employee desires.


                                       3
<PAGE>

         The term "Cause" means:

                           (i)      Employee engages, during the performance of
his duties hereunder, in acts or omissions constituting dishonesty, intentional
breach of fiduciary obligation or intentional wrongdoing or malfeasance; or

                           (ii)     Employee intentionally disobeys or
disregards a lawful and proper direction of the Board or the Company; or

                           (iii)    Employee materially breaches the Agreement
and such breach by its nature, is incapable of being cured, or such breach
remains uncured for more than 10 days following receipt by Employee of written
notice from the Company specifying the nature of the breach and demanding the
cure thereof. For purposes of this clause (iii), a material breach of the
Agreement that involves inattention by Employee to his duties under the
Agreement shall be deemed a breach capable of cure.

                  (b)      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
following shall not constitute Cause for the termination of the employment of
Employee or the modification or diminution of any of his authority hereunder:

                           (i)      any personal or policy disagreement between
Employee and the Company or any member of the Board, or

                           (ii)     any action taken by Employee in connection
with his duties hereunder, or any failure to act, if Employee acted or failed to
act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in and not
opposed to the best interest of the Company and he had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful; or

                           (iii)    termination of employment of Employee for
unsatisfactory performance (including failure to meet financial goals).

         Termination for Cause shall be limited to a good faith finding by
resolution of the Board, setting forth the particulars thereof. Any such
resolution shall be final and binding upon Employee.

                  (c)      The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time
prior to a Change in Control of the Company as defined in Section 12(d)(i) for
unsatisfactory performance by Employee of his duties and responsibilities
hereunder (including but not limited to failure to meet financial goals as may
be approved by the Compensation Committee), provided that the Company has given
Employee (i) written notice setting forth the particulars of his performance
deficiencies and (ii) six months opportunity to correct them to the satisfaction
of the Company. Any termination under this section 9(c) shall be by resolution
of the Board of Directors of the Company, which shall be final and binding upon
Employee. In the event of termination pursuant to this section 9(c), the


                                       4
<PAGE>

Company will pay to Employee, monthly for 24 months, an amount (subject to
applicable withholding) equal to Employee's regular monthly base salary at time
of termination; provided, however, all such payment obligations shall terminate
immediately upon any breach by Employee of section 10 of this Agreement. Upon
termination pursuant to this section 9(c), no further compensation or benefits
shall accrue or be payable to Employee under this Agreement except for (i) the
salary continuation payments provided for above, and (ii) any compensation bonus
or other benefits which have accrued to Employee prior to the date of any such
termination.

                  (d)      The Company or the Employee may terminate this
Agreement at any time because of the Disability of Employee. "Disability" shall
mean a physical or mental condition which has prevented Employee from
substantially performing his duties under this Agreement for a period of 180
days and which is expected to continue to render Employee unable to
substantially perform his duties for the remaining term of this Agreement on a
full-time basis. The Company will make reasonable accommodation for any handicap
of Employee as may be required by applicable law.

         In the event of termination by the Company for Disability, a good faith
determination of the existence of a Disability shall be made by resolution of
the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion, setting forth the
particulars of the Disability which shall be final and binding upon the
Employee. The Company may require the submission of such medical evidence as to
the condition of the Employee as it may deem necessary in order to arrive at its
determination of the occurrence of a Disability. Employee will be provided with
reasonable opportunity to present additional medical evidence as to the medical
condition of Employee for consideration prior to the Board making its
determination of the occurrence of a Disability.

         Upon termination of this Agreement for Disability, Employee will
continue to be eligible to participate in the Company's medical, dental and life
insurance programs available to executive officers in accordance with their
terms applicable to employees for a period of 3 years from the date of such
termination of this Agreement.

                  (e)      This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the
death of Employee during the term. In such event, death benefits payable under
any of the Company's benefit plans in which Employee was a participant at the
time of his death shall be payable in accordance with the terms of such plans.

                  (f)      Employee may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days
written notice if any person other than Employee is selected by the Board of
Directors to succeed the present Chairman of the Board upon his retirement,
resignation or other departure from that office. In the event of termination by
Employee for such reason, the Company will pay to Employee, monthly for 24
months, an amount (subject to applicable withholding) equal to Employee's
regular monthly base salary at time of termination plus an amount equal to
1/12th of the most recent fiscal year cash bonus paid to Employee; provided all
such payment obligations shall terminate immediately


                                       5
<PAGE>

upon any breach by Employee of paragraph 10 of this Agreement. Upon termination
of this Agreement by Employee pursuant to this paragraph, no further
compensation or benefits shall accrue or be payable to Employee under this
Agreement except for (i) the salary continuation payments provided for above,
and (ii) any compensation, bonus or other benefits which have accrued to
Employee prior to the date of any such termination.

         10.      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND RESTRICTION OF COMPETITION.

                  (a)      Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets,
confidential information, secret processes and know-how developed and acquired
by the Company and other subsidiaries of the Company (together the "Affiliated
Companies") are among their most valuable assets and that the value of such
information may be destroyed by unauthorized disclosure. All such trade secrets,
confidential information, secret processes and know-how imparted to or learned
by Employee in the course of his employment with respect to the business of the
Affiliated Companies (whether acquired before or after the date hereof) will be
deemed to be confidential and will not be used or disclosed by Employee, except
to the extent necessary to perform his duties and, in no event, disclosed to
anyone outside the employ of the Affiliated Companies and their authorized
consultants and advisors, unless either such information is or has been made
generally available to the public or express written authorization to use or
disclose such information has been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to
be employed by the Company for any reason, he shall not take with him any
documents or other papers containing or reflecting trade secrets, confidential
information, secret processes or know-how. Employee acknowledges that his
employment hereunder will place him in a position of utmost confidence and that
he will have access to confidential information concerning the operation of the
business of the Affiliated Companies, including, but not limited to,
manufacturing methods, developments, secret processes, know-how, costs, prices
and pricing methods, sources of supply and customer names and relations. All
such information is in the nature of a trade secret and is the exclusive
property of the Affiliated Companies and shall be deemed confidential
information for the purposes of this paragraph.

                  (b)      Employee agrees that during the term hereof and for a
period of two (2) years after voluntary termination of employment hereunder by
Employee or termination of employment hereunder by Company pursuant to section 9
above, he shall not, without the express written consent of the Company, either
alone or as a consultant to, or partner, employee, officer, director, or
stockholder of any organization, entity or business, (i) engage in direct or
indirect competition with the Company or any Affiliated Company within 100 miles
of any location within the United States of America or any other country where
the Company or any Affiliated Company does business from time to time during the
term hereof; (ii) solicit in connection with any activity which is competitive
with any of the businesses of the Company or any Affiliated Company, any
customers or suppliers of the Company or any Affiliated Company; (iii) solicit
for employment any sales, marketing or management employee of Company or any


                                       6
<PAGE>

Affiliated Company or induce or attempt to induce any customer or supplier of
the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate or materially change such
relationship. Company and Employee acknowledge the reasonableness of this
covenant not to compete and non-solicitation and the reasonableness thereof,
including but not limited to the geographic area and duration of time which are
a part hereof. This covenant not to compete may be enforced with respect to any
geographic area in which the Company or any Affiliated Company does business
during the term hereof. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee from being the
legal or equitable holder of not more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock
of any publicly held corporation which may be in direct or indirect competition
with the Company or any Affiliated Company.

                  (c)      If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section
10 shall be deemed invalid or unenforceable by the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is to be enforced by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to
duration, geographic scope, nature of activities restricted, or for any other
reason, this provision shall be considered divisible as to such portions and the
foregoing restrictions shall become and be immediately amended to include only
such duration, scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed reasonable
and enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction to enforce this
Agreement; and the parties hereto agree that the restrictions, as so amended,
shall be valid and binding as though the invalid or unenforceable portion had
not been involved herein.

                  (d)      The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company
would be irreparably harmed by violations of this Section 10 and in recognition
thereof, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or other decree of
specific performance with respect to any violation thereof (without any bond or
other security being required) in addition to other available legal and
equitable remedies.

                  (e)      This Section 10 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and any termination of Employee's employment.

         11.      CHANGES IN BUSINESS. The Company, acting through its Board of
Directors, will at all times have complete control over the Company's business.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may at any time or
times change or discontinue any or all of its present or future operations, may
close or move any one or more of its divisions or offices, may undertake any new
servicing or sales operation, may sell any one or more of its divisions or
offices to any company not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Company or
may take any and all other steps which its Board of Directors, in its exclusive
judgment, shall deem desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or recourse by
reason of such action. Provided, however, no such action shall result in the
reduction of Employee's Base Salary hereunder; provided, further that if the
Company discontinues operations, a discretionary bonus may or may not be
granted, however, Employee will be entitled to a pro-rata share of any
non-discretionary incentive bonus through the date of discontinuance. Said
pro-rata bonus will be


                                       7
<PAGE>

calculated by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company whose determination
will be final.

         12.      CHANGE IN CONTROL.

                  (a)      In the event:

                           (i)      a Change in Control of the Company occurs,
and

                           (ii)     (A) at any time during the 24 month period
commencing on the date of the Change in Control the Company terminates
Employee's employment for other than Cause or Disability, or Employee terminates
his employment for Good Reason, in either case by written notice to the other
party (including the particulars thereof), and having given the other party the
opportunity to be heard with respect thereto, or (B) Employee's employment with
the Company terminates for any reason other than Disability or death during the
30-day period commencing on the expiration of the aforementioned 18 month
period, then:

                                    (1)      the Company shall promptly pay to
Employee a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (A) all base
salary earned through the date of termination, (B) any annual cash bonus earned
by Employee for the fiscal year of the Company most recently ended prior to the
date of termination to the extent unpaid on the date of termination, (C) a
prorata portion of the annual cash bonus, including value of any restricted
stock grant in lieu of annual cash bonus, Employee would have earned had he been
employed by the Company on the last day of the fiscal year in which the date of
termination occurs (as if all performance targets had been met) that is
applicable to the period commencing on the first day of such fiscal year and
ending on the date of termination, and (D) any and all other benefits and
amounts earned by Employee prior to the date of termination to the extent
unpaid, all subject to applicable withholding.

                                    (2)      The Company shall promptly pay to
Employee in a lump sum, a cash payment in an amount equal to three times
Employee's total cash compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus,
including value of any restricted stock grant in lieu of cash bonus) for either
the fiscal year of the Company most recently ended prior to the date of
termination, or the preceding fiscal year, whichever is the highest total
compensation subject to applicable withholding. Employee may elect to take
payment of any amounts on a schedule of his own choosing; provided that such
schedule shall be completed no later than three years from the date of
Employee's termination of employment.

                                    (3)      Employee and his dependents
shall continue to be covered by, and receive employee welfare and executive
fringe benefits in accordance with the terms of, all of the Company's benefit
plans and executive fringe benefit programs for three years following the
date of termination, and at no less than the levels he and his dependents
were receiving

                                       8
<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Change in Control. Employee's dependents shall be
entitled to continued coverage pursuant to the preceding sentence for the
balance of such three year period in the event of Employee's death during
such period. The period during which Employee and his dependents are entitled
to continuation of group health plan coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Part 6 of Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, shall commence
on the date next following the expiration of the aforementioned three year
period.

                                    (4)      Employee shall receive an
additional retirement benefit, over and above that which Employee would
normally be entitled to under the Company's retirement plans or programs
applicable to Employee, equal to the actuarial equivalent of the additional
amount that Employee would have earned under such retirement plans or
programs had he accumulated three additional continuous years of service.
Such amount shall be paid to Employee in a cash lump sum payment on the
Employee's Retirement Date, as defined in the AAR CORP. Retirement Plan or
any successor plan or promptly upon a termination of employment which
triggers Change in Control termination of employment benefits hereunder. In
such event, the Company shall concurrently pay Employee a gross-up bonus in
an amount equal to any federal, state and local income taxes and excise taxes
(including FICA or any similar taxes) payable by Employee on such lump sum
payment and such gross-up bonus.

                                    (5)      The Company, at its expense,
shall provide Employee with outplacement services of a nationally recognized
outplacement firm of the Employee's choosing until the earlier of the
Employee's attainment of employment or the date eighteen months from the date
of Employee's termination of employment; provided, however, that the cost of
such outplacement services shall not exceed 3.5% of the cash payment due to
Employee pursuant to subsection 12(a)(ii)(2) above.

                  (b)      The amounts paid to the Employee under this Change in
Control provision applicable to Employee shall be considered severance pay in
consideration of past services Employee has rendered to the Company and in
consideration of Employee's continued service from the date hereof to
entitlement to those payments.

                  (c)      In the event that a Change in Control has
occurred, both for purposes of this Agreement and for purposes of the AAR
CORP. Stock Benefit Plan, as amended ("Plan"), whether or not such Change in
Control has the prior written approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors (as defined in the Plan), and notwithstanding any conditions or
restrictions, related to any Award granted to Employee under the Plan, all
options grants and restricted stock awards provided for hereunder which have
not then become vested (including released restrictions) or exercisable,
shall immediately become exercisable or vested, as the case may be, all
performance shares to be awarded hereunder shall be immediately awarded
according to Appendix (i) of this Agreement, and all Options or Limited
Rights, or both, granted to Employee under the Plan will become immediately

                                       9
<PAGE>

exercisable and remain exercisable for the full remaining life of the
option(s) whether or not Employee's employment continues, and all
restrictions on Restricted Stock granted to Employee under the Plan,
including any performance share awards, will immediately lapse.

                  (d)      For purposes of this provision

                           (i)      Change in Control means the earliest of:

                                    (A)      any person (as such term is used in

of the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote for the
election of directors; or

                                    (B)      the effective time of (1) a merger

entity of which the Company owns at least 80% of the voting stock; or

                                    (C)      the election, over any period of
time, to the Board of Directors of the Company without the recommendation or
approval of the incumbent Board of Directors of the Company, of the lesser of
(1) three directors, or (2) directors constituting a majority of the number of
directors of the Company then in office.

                           (ii)     "Good Reason" means:

                                    (A)      a material reduction in the nature

from those enjoyed by Employee immediately prior to the Change in Control, or a
material reduction in Employee's compensation (including benefits), occurring at
any time during the two-year period immediately after the Change in Control; or

                                    (B)      a good faith determination by
Employee that as the result of a Change in Control and a material change in
employment circumstances thereafter, he is unable to carry out his duties and
responsibilities contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
practices, standards, values or philosophy of the Company immediately prior to
the Change in Control; or

                                    (C)      a material breach of this Agreement
by the Company; or

<PAGE>

                  (e)      The Company shall promptly pay Employee a gross-up
bonus in an amount equal to (i) all excise taxes payable under Section 280G of
the Internal Revenue Code on any amounts constituting "golden parachute"
payments, plus (ii) any federal, state, and local income taxes and excise taxes

                  (f)      The Company will continue to provide SKERP benefits
to Employee at no less than the level Employee and Employee's dependents were
receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Change in Control,
under the SKERP as it was then in effect.

                  (g)      The Company will pay reasonable legal/attorney's fees
(including court costs and other costs of litigation) incurred by Employee in
connection with enforcement of any right or benefit under this Agreement.

Agreement by the Company, Employee, and their respective legal counsel.
Accordingly, the rule of construction that the ambiguities of the contract shall

         period from date of appointment as CEO (July 9, 1996), vesting at 25%
         of the award on each of the 4 anniversary dates of the award. This
         grant will be made at fair market value as of the grant date.

- -        Up to 15,000 restricted shares in each of the 4 years of the
         performance period with the initial grant at the beginning of the
         4-year performance period and subsequent grant on the next three
         successive anniversary dates of the CEO's appointment as CEO. Award
         will be made at fair market value on the date of the grant with vesting
         of 33% of the award on each of the 3 anniversary dates following the
         award. The actual number of shares granted is at the discretion of the
         Committee.

- -        Up to 360,000 performance units (payable in performance restricted
         stock in the manner described below) to be determined at the end of the
         four year performance period based on achievement of the following
         specified performance goals in four categories over the 4-year
         performance period:

         A.       The Company's cumulative percentage Total Return to
                  Shareholders as compared to that of the S&P 500 Composite

                  confidential information concerning the operation of the
                  business of the Affiliated Companies, including, but not

                  of supply and customer names and relations. All such
                  information is in the nature of a trade secret and is the sole
                  and exclusive property of the Affiliated Companies and shall
                  be deemed confidential information for the purposes of this

                  invention, improvement, or any other idea or thing whatever
                  that Employee may write, draw, design, conceive, perfect, or
                  reduce to practice during employment with the Company or
                  within 120 days after termination of such employment, whether
                  done during or outside of normal work hours, and whether done
                  alone or in conjunction with others ("Intellectual Property"),

                  anything done or developed entirely by Employee on Employee's
                  own personal time and without the use of any Company
                  equipment, supplies, facilities or information, or the
                  participation of any other Company employee, unless it relates
                  to the Company's business or reasonably anticipated business,
                  or grows out of any work performed by Employee for the
                  Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual
                  Property developed by Employee to the Company, and fully
                  cooperate at the Company's request and expense in any efforts
                  by the Company or its assignees to secure protection for such
                  Intellectual Property by way of domestic or foreign patent,
                  copyright, trademark or service mark registration or
                  otherwise, including executing specific assignments or such
                  other documents or taking such further action as may be
                  considered necessary to vest title in Company or its assignees
                  and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

                  term of his employment; (ii) engage in direct or indirect
                  competition with the Company or any Affiliated Company within
                  100 miles of any location within the United States of America

                  supplier of the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate
                  or materially change such relationship. Company and Employee
                  acknowledge the reasonableness of the foregoing covenants not
                  to compete and non-solicitation, including but not limited to
                  the geographic area and duration of time which are a part
                  hereof, and further, that the restrictions stated in this
                  Section 5 are reasonably necessary for the protection of
                  Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant not
                  to compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area
                  in which the Company or any Affiliated Company does business
                  during the term hereof. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee
                  from being the legal or equitable holder, solely for
                  investment purposes, of less than 5% of the capital stock of
                  any publicly held corporation which may be in direct or
                  indirect competition with the Company or any Affiliated
                  Company.

         (b)      Upon termination of Employee's employment by the Company prior
                  to a Change in Control (as defined in 7(c)(i) below) for any
                  reason other than Cause (as defined in 7(c)(iv) below), the
                  Company will pay Employee severance each month

                  for 12 months ("Severance Period"), in an amount (subject to
                  applicable withholding) equal to 1/12 of Employee's base
                  salary; and, further, the Company will pay Employee a PIP
                  bonus award in accordance with and subject to the terms and
                  conditions of Employee's PIP in a lump sum at the time any
                  such PIP bonuses are payable under the PIP or at such time as
                  the Severance Period is complete, whichever is later (with
                  interest at prime rate plus one percentage point from the
                  earlier of such dates), for any PIP bonuses earned (1) in the
                  completed fiscal year preceding termination but not due and
                  payable prior to termination, and (2) prorata for the period
                  prior to termination of employment in any partial PIP fiscal
                  year based on Employee's performance against Employee's PIP
                  during such partial period; provided, however, that (i) all
                  such monthly payment obligations shall terminate immediately
                  upon Employee obtaining full time employment in a comparable
                  position in terms of salary level, and (ii) all such payment
                  obligations shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any
                  breach by Employee of Section 4 or 5(a) of this Agreement or
                  if Employee shall commence any action or proceeding in any
                  court or before any regulatory agency arising out of or in
                  connection with termination of Employee's employment.

         (c)      If Employee terminates Employee's employment or Employee's
                  employment is terminated by the Company for Cause (as defined
                  below), the Company may elect (but is not required to), by
                  written notice thereof to Employee, within five (5) days of
                  any such termination of Employee's employment with the Company
                  prior to a Change in Control (as defined below), to pay
                  Employee severance as provided in and subject to the
                  provisions of subsection 5(b) above.

         (d)      Employee may terminate this Severance and Change in Control
                  Agreement effective immediately upon notice thereof in writing
                  to Company at any time while still employed within a sixty
                  (60) calendar day period immediately following the effective
                  date of any reduction by Company in (i) Employee's level of
                  responsibility or position from that held by Employee as
                  Executive Vice President on the effective date of this
                  Agreement, or (ii) Employee's level of compensation, including
                  retirement benefits in effect immediately prior to any such
                  change.

         (e)      If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 5 shall
                  be deemed invalid or unenforceable by the laws of the
                  jurisdiction in which it is to be enforced by reason of being
                  vague or unreasonable as to duration, geographic scope, nature
                  of activities restricted, or for any other reason, this
                  provision shall be considered divisible as to such portions
                  and the foregoing restrictions set forth in 5(a) shall become
                  and be immediately amended to include only such duration,
                  scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed
                  reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having
                  jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement; and the parties hereto
                  agree that the restrictions, as so amended, shall be valid and
                  binding as though the invalid or unenforceable portion had not
                  been involved herein.

         (f)      The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company would be
                  irreparably harmed by violations of Section 4 or Section 5(a)
                  above, and in recognition thereof, the Company shall be
                  entitled to an injunction or other decree of specific
                  performance with respect to any violation thereof (without any
                  bond or other

                  and equitable remedies.

6.       TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

         (a)      Upon and after termination of employment howsoever arising,
                  Employee shall, upon request by Company:

                  (1)      immediately return to the Company all correspondence,
                           documents, business calendars/diaries, or other
                           property belonging to the Company which is in
                           Employee's possession,

                  (2)      immediately resign from any office Employee holds
                           with the Company or any Affiliated Company; and

                  (3)      cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in
                           the resolution of all matters Employee worked on or
                           was involved in during Employee's employment with the
                           Company. Employee's cooperation will include
                           reasonable consultation by telephone. Further, in
                           connection therewith, Employee will, at Company's
                           request upon reasonable advance notice and subject to
                           Employee's availability, make Employee available to
                           Company in person at Company's premises, for
                           testimony in court, or elsewhere; provided, however,
                           that in such event, Company shall reimburse all
                           Employee's reasonable expenses and pay Employee a
                           reasonable per diem or hourly stipend.

7.       CHANGE IN CONTROL.

         (a)      In the event (i) a Change in Control of AAR CORP. occurs, and
                  (ii) (A) at any time during the 18 month period commencing on
                  the date of the Change in Control the Company terminates
                  Employee's employment for other than Cause or Disability, or
                  Employee terminates Employee's employment for Good Reason, in
                  either case by written notice to the other party (including
                  the particulars thereof), and having given the other party the
                  opportunity to be heard with respect thereto, or (B)
                  Employee's employment with the Company terminates for any
                  reason other than Disability or death during the 30 day period
                  commencing on the expiration of the aforementioned 18 month
                  period, then:

                  (1)      the Company shall promptly pay to Employee, in a lump
                           sum, a cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of

                           termination, (B) any annual cash bonus earned by
                           Employee for the fiscal year of the Company most
                           recently ended prior to the date of termination to
                           the extent unpaid on the date of termination, (C) a
                           prorata portion of the annual cash bonus, including

                           annual cash bonus, Employee would have earned had
                           Employee been employed by the Company on the last day
                           of the fiscal year in which the date of termination
                           occurs (as if all performance targets have been met
                           or, in the event the bonus is of the "discretionary"
                           type, the bonus shall be based on a percentage of
                           base

                           salary received as bonus for the preceding fiscal
                           year) that is applicable to the period commencing on
                           the first day of such fiscal year and ending on the
                           date of termination, and (D) any and all other
                           benefits and amounts earned by Employee prior to the
                           date of termination to the extent unpaid, all subject

                           restricted stock grant in lieu of annual cash bonus)

                           recently ended prior to the date of termination, or
                           the preceding fiscal year, whichever is the highest
                           total compensation, or such lesser amount as Employee
                           may elect to take, subject to applicable withholding.
                           Employee may elect to take payment of any amounts on
                           a schedule of Employee's own choosing; provided that
                           such schedule shall be completed no later than three
                           years from the date of Employee's termination of

                           to medical, dental, life, accident and disability
                           insurance available to officers of the Company and

                           benefits approved by the President and CEO of the
                           Company) in accordance with the terms of the
                           Company's benefit plans and executive fringe benefit
                           programs, for three years following the date of
                           termination, and at no less than the levels Employee
                           and Employee's dependents were receiving immediately
                           prior to the Change in Control. Employee's dependents
                           shall be entitled to continued benefits coverage
                           pursuant to the preceding sentence for the balance of
                           such three year period in the event of Employee's
                           death during such period. The period during which
                           Employee and Employee's dependents are entitled to
                           continuation of group health plan coverage pursuant

                           Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
                           amended, shall commence on the date next following
                           the expiration of the aforementioned three year
                           period.

                  (4)      Employee shall receive an additional retirement
                           benefit, over and above that which Employee would
                           normally be entitled to under the Company's
                           retirement plans or programs applicable to Employee,
                           equal to the actuarial equivalent of the additional
                           amount that Employee would have earned under such
                           retirement plans or programs had Employee accumulated
                           three additional continuous years of service. Such
                           amount shall be paid to Employee in a cash lump sum
                           payment on the earlier to occur of Employee's
                           termination of employment following a Change in
                           Control or Employee's Retirement Date, together with
                           a gross-up bonus in an amount equal to any federal,
                           state and local income taxes and excise taxes
                           (including FICA and any similar taxes) payable by
                           Employee on such lump sum payment and such gross-up
                           bonus.

                  (5)      The Company, at its expense, shall provide Employee
                           with outplacement services of a nationally recognized
                           outplacement firm of the Employee's choosing until
                           the earlier of (a) the Employee's attainment of
                           employment, or (b) the date eighteen (18) months from
                           the date of Employee's termination of employment;
                           provided, however, that the cost of such outplacement
                           services shall not exceed 3.5% of the cash payment
                           due to Employee pursuant to subsection 7(a)(2) above.

                  (6)      The amounts paid to Employee under this Change in
                           Control provision applicable to Employee shall be
                           considered severance pay in consideration of past
                           service Employee has rendered to the Company and in
                           consideration of Employee's continued service from
                           the date hereof to entitlement of those payments.

         (b)      In the event that a Change in Control occurs, whether or not
                  such Change in Control has the prior written approval of a
                  majority of the Continuing Directors (as defined in the AAR
                  CORP. Stock Benefit Plan), and notwithstanding any conditions
                  or restrictions related to any Award granted to Employee under
                  the Plan, all Options or Limited Rights, or both, granted to
                  Employee under the Plan will become immediately exercisable
                  and remain exercisable for the full remaining life of the
                  option whether or not Employee's employment continues, and all
                  restrictions on Restricted Stock granted to Employee under the
                  Plan will immediately lapse.

                                    to believe Employee's conduct was unlawful,
                                    or

                           which have accrued to Employee prior to the date of
                           any such termination.

                           Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the
                           Company from terminating Employee's employment at any
                           time for any reason or for no reason.

         (d)      The Company will pay reasonable legal/attorney's fees

                  benefit under this Agreement.

         (e)      The Company shall promptly pay Employee a gross-up bonus in an
                  amount equal to (i) all excise taxes payable under Section

                  "golden parachute" payments, plus (ii) any federal, state, and
                  local income taxes and excise taxes (including FICA) payable
                  by Employee on such gross-up bonus in order to put Employee in
                  the same position Employee would have been in if the excise
                  tax provision (Section 280G) did not apply.

                  to Employee and Employee's spouse at no less than the level
                  they are receiving or entitled to receive under the SKERP as
                  it was in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.

         steps which its Board of Directors, in its exclusive judgment, shall
         deem desirable, and Employee shall have no claim or recourse against
         the Company, its officers, directors or employees, by reason of such
         action except for enforcement of the provisions of Section 5 and 7 of
         this Agreement.

         of termination of Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever
         except for any compensation, bonus or other benefits which accrued to
         Employee prior to the date of employment termination.

         The amounts paid to the Employee under Section 5 and 7 of this

4.       CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

         (a)      Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential
                  information, secret processes and know-how developed and
                  acquired by AAR CORP. and its affiliates or subsidiaries
                  (together the "Affiliated Companies") are among their most
                  valuable assets and that the value of such information may be
                  destroyed by unauthorized disclosure. All such trade secrets,
                  confidential information, secret processes and know-how
                  imparted to or learned by Employee in the course of his

                  Companies (whether acquired before or after the date hereof)
                  will be deemed to be confidential and will not be used or
                  disclosed by Employee, except to the extent necessary to
                  perform Employee's duties and, in no event, disclosed to
                  anyone outside the employ of the Affiliated Companies and
                  their authorized consultants and advisors, unless (i) such
                  information is or has been made generally available to the
                  public, (ii) disclosure of such information is required by law
                  in the opinion of Employee's counsel (provided that written
                  notice thereof is given to Company as soon as possible but not
                  less than 24 hours prior to such disclosure), or (iii) express
                  written authorization to use or disclose such information has
                  been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be employed
                  by the Company for any reason, Employee shall not take any
                  electronically stored data, documents or other papers
                  containing or reflecting trade secrets, confidential
                  information, secret processes, know-how, or computer software
                  programs from Company. Employee acknowledges that Employee's
                  employment hereunder will place Employee in a position of
                  utmost confidence and that Employee will have access to
                  confidential information concerning the operation of the
                  business of the Affiliated Companies, including, but not
                  limited to, manufacturing methods, developments, secret
                  processes, know-how, computer software programs, costs, prices
                  and pricing methods, sources of supply and customer names and
                  relations. All such information is in the nature of a trade
                  secret and is the sole and exclusive property of the
                  Affiliated Companies and shall be deemed confidential
                  information for the purposes of this paragraph.

         (b)      Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that
                  Employee may have as author, designer, inventor or otherwise
                  as creator of any written or graphic material, design,
                  invention, improvement, or any other idea or thing whatever
                  that Employee may write, draw, design, conceive, perfect, or
                  reduce to practice during employment with the Company or
                  within 120 days after termination of such employment, whether
                  done during or outside of normal work hours, and whether done
                  alone or in conjunction with others ("Intellectual Property"),
                  provided, however, that Employee reserves all rights in
                  anything done or developed entirely by Employee on Employee's
                  own personal time and without the use of any Company
                  equipment, supplies, facilities or information, or the
                  participation of any other Company employee, unless it relates
                  to the Company's business or reasonably anticipated business,
                  or grows out of any work performed by Employee for the
                  Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual
                  Property developed by Employee to the Company, and fully
                  cooperate at the Company's request and expense in any efforts
                  by the Company or its assignees to secure protection for such
                  Intellectual Property by way of domestic or foreign patent,
                  copyright, trademark or service mark registration or
                  otherwise, including executing specific assignments or such
                  other documents or taking such further action as may be
                  considered necessary to vest title in Company or its assignees
                  and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

5.       NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

         (a)      Employee agrees that during Employee's continuation of
                  employment with the Company and for one (1) year thereafter so
                  long as the Company makes severance payments to Employee
                  pursuant to subsections 5(b) or 5(c) below, Employee shall
                  not, without the express written consent of the Company,
                  either alone or as a consultant to, or partner, employee,
                  officer, director, or stockholder of any organization, entity
                  or business, (i) take or convert for Employee's personal gain
                  or benefit or for the benefit of any third party, any business
                  opportunities which may be of interest to the Company or any
                  Affiliated Company which Employee becomes aware of during the
                  term of his employment; (ii) engage in direct or indirect
                  competition with the Company or any Affiliated Company within
                  100 miles of any location within the United States of America
                  or any other country where the Company or any Affiliated
                  Company does business from time to time during the term
                  hereof; (iii) solicit in connection with any activity which is
                  competitive with any of the businesses of the Company or any
                  Affiliated Company, any customers of the Company or any
                  Affiliated Company; (iv) solicit for employment any sales,
                  marketing or management employee of Company or any Affiliated
                  Company or induce or attempt to induce any customer or
                  supplier of the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate
                  or materially change such relationship. Company and Employee
                  acknowledge the reasonableness of the foregoing covenants not
                  to compete and non-solicitation, including but not limited to
                  the geographic area and duration of time which are a part
                  hereof, and further, that the restrictions stated in this
                  Section 5 are reasonably necessary for the protection of
                  Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant not
                  to compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area
                  in which the Company or any Affiliated Company does business
                  during the term hereof. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee
                  from being

                  of less than 5% of the capital stock of any publicly held
                  corporation which may be in direct or indirect competition
                  with the Company or any Affiliated Company.

         (b)      The Company will pay Employee, upon termination of Employee's
                  employment by the Company prior to a Change in Control (as
                  defined in 7(c)(i) below) for any reason other than Cause (as
                  defined in 7(c)(iv) below), severance each month for 12
                  months, in an amount (subject to applicable withholding) equal
                  to 1/12 of Employee's base salary; and, further, if the
                  Company pays discretionary bonuses to its officers for the
                  fiscal year in which Employee's employment is terminated,
                  Employee will be paid a bonus in a lump sum at the time any
                  such bonuses are paid to other officers or at such time as the
                  Severance Period is complete, whichever is later (with
                  interest at prime rate plus one percentage point from the
                  earlier of such dates), (1) for the completed fiscal year
                  preceding termination if such bonus has not been paid prior to
                  termination, and (2) for the fiscal year in which employment
                  is terminated, prorata for the period prior to termination of
                  employment based on Employee's performance during such period;
                  provided, however, that (i) all such monthly payment
                  obligations shall terminate immediately upon Employee
                  obtaining full time employment in a comparable position in
                  terms of salary level, and (ii) all such payment obligations
                  shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any breach by
                  Employee of Section 4 or 5(a) of this Agreement or if Employee
                  shall commence any action or proceeding in any court or before
                  any regulatory agency arising out of or in connection with
                  termination of Employee's employment.

         (c)      If Employee terminates Employee's employment or Employee's
                  employment is terminated by the Company for Cause (as defined
                  below), the Company may elect (but is not required to), by
                  written notice thereof to Employee, within five (5) days of
                  any such termination of Employee's employment with the Company
                  prior to a Change in Control (as defined below), to pay
                  Employee severance as provided in and subject to the
                  provisions of subsection 5(b) above.

         (d)      Employee may terminate this Severance and Change in Control
                  Agreement effective immediately upon notice thereof in writing
                  to Company at any time while still employed within a sixty
                  (60) calendar day period immediately following the effective
                  date of any reduction by Company in (i) Employee's level of
                  responsibility or position from that held by Employee as Vice
                  President, General Counsel and Secretary on the effective date
                  of this Agreement, or (ii) Employee's level of compensation,
                  including retirement benefits in effect immediately prior to
                  any such change.

         (e)      If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 5 shall
                  be deemed invalid or unenforceable by the laws of the
                  jurisdiction in which it is to be enforced by reason of being
                  vague or unreasonable as to duration, geographic scope, nature
                  of activities restricted, or for any other reason, this
                  provision shall be considered divisible as to such portions
                  and the foregoing restrictions set forth in 5(a) shall become
                  and be immediately amended to include only such duration,
                  scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed
                  reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having
                  jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement; and the parties hereto
                  agree that the

<PAGE>

                  restrictions, as so amended, shall be valid and binding as
                  though the invalid or unenforceable portion had not been
                  involved herein.

         (f)      The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company would be
                  irreparably harmed by violations of Section 4 or Section 5(a)
                  above, and in recognition thereof, the Company shall be
                  entitled to an injunction or other decree of specific
                  performance with respect to any violation thereof (without any
                  bond or other security being required) in addition to other
                  available legal and equitable remedies.

6.       TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

         (a)      Upon and after termination of employment howsoever arising,
                  Employee shall, upon request by Company:

                  (1)      immediately return to the Company all correspondence,
                           documents, business calendars/diaries, or other
                           property belonging to the Company which is in
                           Employee's possession,

                  (2)      immediately resign from any office Employee holds

                  (3)      cooperate fully and in good faith with the Company in
                           the resolution of all matters Employee worked on or
                           was involved in during Employee's employment with the
                           Company. Employee's cooperation will include
                           reasonable consultation by telephone. Further, in
                           connection therewith, Employee will, at Company's
                           request upon reasonable advance notice and subject to
                           Employee's availability, make Employee available to
                           Company in person at Company's premises, for
                           testimony in court, or elsewhere; provided, however,
                           that in such event, Company shall reimburse all
                           Employee's reasonable expenses and pay Employee a
                           reasonable per diem or hourly stipend.

7.       CHANGE IN CONTROL.

         (a)      In the event (i) a Change in Control of AAR CORP. occurs and
                  (ii) (A) at any time during the 18 month period commencing on
                  the date of the Change in Control the Company terminates
                  Employee's employment for other than Cause or Disability, or
                  Employee terminates Employee's employment for Good Reason, in
                  either case by written notice to the other party (including
                  the particulars thereof), and having given the other party the
                  opportunity to be heard with respect thereto, or (B)
                  Employee's employment with the Company terminates for any

                           termination, (B) any annual cash bonus earned by
                           Employee for the fiscal year of the Company most

                           bonus, including the value of any restricted stock
                           grant in lieu of annual cash bonus, Employee would
                           have earned had Employee been employed by the Company
                           on the last day of the fiscal year in which the date
                           of termination occurs (as if all performance targets
                           have been met or, in the event the bonus is of the
                           "discretionary" type, the bonus shall be based on a
                           percentage of base salary which is not less than
                           percentage of base salary received as bonus for the
                           preceding fiscal year) that is applicable to the
                           period commencing on the first day of such fiscal
                           year and ending on the date of termination, and (D)
                           any and all other benefits and amounts earned by
                           Employee prior to the date of termination to the
                           extent unpaid, all subject to applicable withholding.

                  (2)      The Company shall promptly pay to Employee in a lump
                           sum, a cash payment in an amount equal to three times
                           Employee's total compensation (base salary plus
                           annual cash bonus) for either the fiscal year of the
                           Company most recently ended prior to the date of
                           termination, or the preceding fiscal year, whichever
                           is the highest total compensation, subject to
                           applicable withholding. Employee may elect to take
                           payment of any amounts on a schedule of Employee's
                           own choosing; provided that such schedule shall be
                           completed no later than three years from the date of
                           Employee's termination of employment.

                  (3)      Employee and Employee's dependents shall continue to
                           be covered by, and receive employee welfare and
                           executive fringe benefits (including but not limited
                           to medical, dental, life, accident and disability
                           insurance available to officers of the Company and
                           additional executive retirement and other fringe
                           benefits approved by the President and CEO of the
                           Company) in accordance with the terms of the
                           Company's benefit plans and executive fringe benefit
                           programs, for three years following the date of
                           termination, and at no less than the levels Employee
                           and Employee's dependents were receiving immediately
                           prior to the Change in Control. Employee's dependents
                           shall be entitled to continued benefits coverage
                           pursuant to the preceding sentence for the balance of
                           such three year period in the event of Employee's
                           death during such period. The period during which
                           Employee and Employee's dependents are entitled to
                           continuation of group health plan coverage pursuant
                           to Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of
                           1986, as amended, and Part 6 of Title I of the

                  (4)      Employee shall receive an additional retirement
                           benefit, over and above that which Employee would
                           normally be entitled to under the Company's
                           retirement plans or programs applicable to Employee,
                           equal to the actuarial equivalent of the additional
                           amount that Employee would have earned under such
                           retirement plans or programs had Employee accumulated
                           three additional continuous years of service. Such
                           amount shall be paid to Employee in a cash lump sum
                           payment on the earlier to

                           amount equal to any federal, state and local income

                           similar taxes) payable by Employee on such lump sum
                           payment and such gross-up bonus.

                           employment, or (b) the date eighteen (18) months from
                           the date of Employee's termination of employment;
                           provided, however, that the cost of such outplacement
                           services shall not exceed 3.5% of the cash payment
                           due to Employee pursuant to subsection 7(a)(2) above.

                  (6)      The amounts paid to Employee under this Change in
                           Control provision applicable to Employee shall be
                           considered severance pay in consideration of past
                           service Employee has rendered to the Company and in
                           consideration of Employee's continued service from
                           the date hereof to entitlement of those payments.

                  or restrictions related to any Award granted to Employee under
                  the Plan, all Options or Limited Rights, or both, granted to
                  Employee under the Plan will become immediately exercisable
                  and remain exercisable for the full remaining life of the
                  option whether or not Employee's employment continues, and all
                  restrictions on Restricted Stock granted to Employee under the
                  Plan will immediately lapse.

                  claiming any benefit under Employee by virtue of this
                  Agreement, that this Agreement and all rights, interests and
                  benefits hereunder shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged
                  or hypothecated in any way by the Employee or by any
                  beneficiary, heir, executor, administrator or other person
                  claiming under the Employee by virtue of this Agreement and
                  shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar
                  process. Any attempted assigned, transfer, pledge or
                  hypothecation or any other disposition of this Agreement or of
                  such rights, interests and benefits contrary to the foregoing
                  provisions or the levy or any execution, attachment or similar

         Agreement or any clause or provision hereof.

4.       CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTIONS.

         (a)      Employee acknowledges that the trade secrets, confidential
                  information, secret processes and know-how developed and
                  acquired by AAR CORP. and its affiliates or subsidiaries
                  (together the "Affiliated Companies") are among their most
                  valuable assets and that the value of such information may be
                  destroyed by unauthorized disclosure. All such trade secrets,
                  confidential information, secret processes and know-how
                  imparted to or learned by Employee in the course of his
                  employment with respect to the business of the Affiliated
                  Companies (whether acquired before or after the date hereof)
                  will be deemed to be confidential and will not be used or
                  disclosed by Employee, except to the extent necessary to
                  perform Employee's duties and, in no event, disclosed to
                  anyone outside the employ of the Affiliated Companies and
                  their authorized consultants and advisors, unless (i) such
                  information is or has been made generally available to the
                  public, (ii) disclosure of such information is required by law
                  in the opinion of Employee's counsel (provided that written
                  notice thereof is given to Company as soon as possible but not
                  less than 24 hours prior to such disclosure), or (iii) express
                  written authorization to use or disclose such information has
                  been given by the Company. If Employee ceases to be employed
                  by the Company for any reason, Employee shall not take any
                  electronically stored data, documents or other papers
                  containing or reflecting trade secrets, confidential
                  information, secret processes, know-how, or computer software
                  programs from Company. Employee acknowledges that Employee's
                  employment hereunder will place Employee in a position of
                  utmost confidence and that Employee will have access to
                  confidential information concerning the operation of the
                  business of the Affiliated Companies, including, but not
                  limited to, manufacturing methods, developments, secret
                  processes, know-how, computer software programs, costs, prices
                  and pricing methods, sources of supply and customer names and
                  relations. All such information is in the nature of a trade
                  secret and is the sole and exclusive property of the
                  Affiliated Companies and shall be deemed confidential
                  information for the purposes of this paragraph.

         (b)      Employee hereby assigns to the Company all rights that
                  Employee may have as author, designer, inventor or otherwise
                  as creator of any written or graphic material, design,
                  invention, improvement, or any other idea or thing whatever
                  that Employee may write, draw, design, conceive, perfect, or
                  reduce to practice during employment with the Company or
                  within 120 days after termination of such employment, whether
                  done during or outside of normal work hours, and whether done
                  alone or in conjunction with others ("Intellectual Property"),
                  provided, however, that Employee reserves all rights in
                  anything done or developed entirely by Employee on Employee's
                  own personal time and without the use of any Company
                  equipment, supplies, facilities or information, or the
                  participation of any other Company employee, unless it relates
                  to the Company's business or reasonably anticipated business,
                  or grows out of any work performed by Employee for the
                  Company. Employee will promptly disclose all such Intellectual
                  Property developed by Employee to the Company, and fully
                  cooperate at the Company's request and expense in any efforts
                  by the Company or its assignees to secure protection for such
                  Intellectual Property by way of domestic or foreign patent,
                  copyright, trademark or service mark registration or
                  otherwise, including executing specific assignments or such
                  other documents or taking such further action as may be
                  considered necessary to vest title in Company or its assignees
                  and obtain patents or copyrights in any and all countries.

5.       NON-COMPETE; SEVERANCE.

         (a)      Employee agrees that during Employee's continuation of
                  employment with the Company and for one (1) year thereafter so
                  long as the Company makes severance payments to Employee
                  pursuant to subsections 5(b) or 5(c) below, Employee shall
                  not, without the express written consent of the Company,
                  either alone or as a consultant to, or partner, employee,
                  officer, director, or stockholder of any organization, entity
                  or business, (i) take or convert for Employee's personal gain
                  or benefit or for the benefit of any third party, any business
                  opportunities which may be of interest to the Company or any
                  Affiliated Company which Employee becomes aware of during the
                  term of his employment; (ii) engage in direct or indirect
                  competition with the Company or any Affiliated Company within
                  100 miles of any location within the United States of America
                  or any other country where the Company or any Affiliated
                  Company does business from time to time during the term
                  hereof; (iii) solicit in connection with any activity which is
                  competitive with any of the businesses of the Company or any
                  Affiliated Company, any customers of the Company or any
                  Affiliated Company; (iv) solicit for employment any sales,
                  marketing or management employee of Company or any Affiliated
                  Company or induce or attempt to induce any customer or
                  supplier of the Company or any Affiliated Company to terminate
                  or materially change such relationship. Company and Employee
                  acknowledge the reasonableness of the foregoing covenants not
                  to compete and non-solicitation, including but not limited to
                  the geographic area and duration of time which are a part
                  hereof, and further, that the restrictions stated in this
                  Section 5 are reasonably necessary for the protection of
                  Employer's legitimate proprietary interests. This covenant not
                  to compete may be enforced with respect to any geographic area
                  in which the Company or any Affiliated Company does business
                  during the term hereof. Nothing herein shall prohibit Employee
                  from being

                  the legal or equitable holder, solely for investment purposes,
                  of less than 5% of the capital stock of any publicly held
                  corporation which may be in direct or indirect competition
                  with the Company or any Affiliated Company.

         (b)      The Company will pay Employee, upon termination of Employee's
                  employment by the Company prior to a Change in Control (as
                  defined in 7(c)(i) below) for any reason other than Cause (as
                  defined in 7(c)(iv) below), severance each month for 12
                  months, in an amount (subject to applicable withholding) equal
                  to 1/12 of Employee's base salary; and, further, if the
                  Company pays discretionary bonuses to its officers for the
                  fiscal year in which Employee's employment is terminated,
                  Employee will be paid a bonus in a lump sum at the time any
                  such bonuses are paid to other officers or at such time as the
                  Severance Period is complete, whichever is later (with
                  interest at prime rate plus one percentage point from the
                  earlier of such dates), (1) for the completed fiscal year
                  preceding termination if such bonus has not been paid prior to
                  termination, and (2) for the fiscal year in which employment
                  is terminated, prorata for the period prior to termination of
                  employment based on Employee's performance during such period;
                  provided, however, that (i) all such monthly payment
                  obligations shall terminate immediately upon Employee
                  obtaining full time employment in a comparable position in
                  terms of salary level, and (ii) all such payment obligations
                  shall terminate or lapse immediately upon any breach by
                  Employee of Section 4 or 5(a) of this Agreement or if Employee
                  shall commence any action or proceeding in any court or before
                  any regulatory agency arising out of or in connection with
                  termination of Employee's employment.

         (c)      If Employee terminates Employee's employment or Employee's
                  employment is terminated by the Company for Cause (as defined
                  below), the Company may elect (but is not required to), by
                  written notice thereof to Employee, within five (5) days of
                  any such termination of Employee's employment with the Company
                  prior to a Change in Control (as defined below), to pay
                  Employee severance as provided in and subject to the
                  provisions of subsection 5(b) above.

         (d)      Employee may terminate this Severance and Change in Control
                  Agreement effective immediately upon notice thereof in writing
                  to Company at any time while still employed within a sixty
                  (60) calendar day period immediately following the effective

                  or (ii) Employee's level of compensation, including retirement
                  benefits in effect immediately prior to any such change.

         (e)      If at any time, any clause or portion of this Section 5 shall
                  be deemed invalid or unenforceable by the laws of the
                  jurisdiction in which it is to be enforced by reason of being
                  vague or unreasonable as to duration, geographic scope, nature
                  of activities restricted, or for any other reason, this
                  provision shall be considered divisible as to such portions
                  and the foregoing restrictions set forth in 5(a) shall become
                  and be immediately amended to include only such duration,
                  scope or restriction and such event as shall be deemed
                  reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having
                  jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement; and the parties hereto
                  agree that the

                  restrictions, as so amended, shall be valid and binding as
                  though the invalid or unenforceable portion had not been
                  involved herein.

         (f)      The Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company would be
                  irreparably harmed by violations of Section 4 or Section 5(a)
                  above, and in recognition thereof, the Company shall be
                  entitled to an injunction or other decree of specific
                  performance with respect to any violation thereof (without any
                  bond or other security being required) in addition to other
                  available legal and equitable remedies.

6.       TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

         (a)      Upon and after termination of employment howsoever arising,
                  Employee shall, upon request by Company:

                           reasonable consultation by telephone. Further, in
                           connection therewith, Employee will, at Company's
                           request upon reasonable advance notice and subject to

                           that in such event, Company shall reimburse all
                           Employee's reasonable expenses and pay Employee a
                           reasonable per diem or hourly stipend.

                           grant in lieu of annual cash bonus, Employee would
                           have earned had Employee been employed by the Company

                           of termination occurs (as if all performance targets
                           have been met or, in the event the bonus is of the
                           "discretionary" type, the bonus shall be based on a
                           percentage of base salary which is not less than

                           Company most recently ended prior to the date of
                           termination, or the preceding fiscal year, whichever

                           own choosing; provided that such schedule shall be

                           be covered by, and receive employee welfare and
                           executive fringe benefits (including but not limited

                           benefits approved by the President and CEO of the
                           Company) in accordance with the terms of the

                           programs, for three years following the date of
                           termination, and at no less than the levels Employee
                           and Employee's dependents were receiving immediately
                           prior to the Change in Control. Employee's dependents
                           shall be entitled to continued benefits coverage
                           pursuant to the preceding sentence for the balance of
                           such three year period in the event of Employee's
                           death during such period. The period during which

                           benefit, over and above that which Employee would
                           normally be entitled to under the Company's
                           retirement plans or programs applicable to Employee,
                           equal to the actuarial equivalent of the additional
                           amount that Employee would have earned under such
                           retirement plans or programs had Employee accumulated
                           three additional continuous years of service. Such
                           amount shall be paid to Employee in a cash lump sum

                  Company. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
                  upon and inure to the benefit of the estate and beneficiaries
                  of Employee and upon and to the benefit of the permitted
                  successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

                  claiming any benefit under Employee by virtue of this
                  Agreement, that this Agreement and all rights, interests and
                  benefits hereunder shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged
                  or hypothecated in any way by the Employee or by any
                  beneficiary, heir, executor, administrator or other person
                  claiming under the Employee by virtue of this Agreement and
                  shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar
                  process. Any attempted assigned, transfer, pledge or
                  hypothecation or any other disposition of this Agreement or of
                  such rights, interests and benefits contrary to the foregoing
                  provisions or the levy or any execution, attachment or similar

                  effect.

12.      SEVERABILITY. If any term, clause or provision contained herein is
         declared or held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such

         rule of construction that the ambiguities of the contract shall be
         resolved against the party which caused the contract to be drafted
         shall have no application in the construction or interpretation of this
         Agreement or any clause or provision hereof.

14.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement as amended and restated herein and the
         other agreements referred to herein set forth the entire understanding

         the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach
         by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or


                                       12
<PAGE>

         provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall

                NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

                 AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE APRIL 8, 1997

                            SECTION I - INTRODUCTION

         Effective January 1, 1996 AAR CORP. ("Company") established the
Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan ("Plan") for members of its
Board of Directors ("Board"), who are not employees of the Company or an
affiliate ("Nonemployee Directors"). The Plan is amended and restated, effective
April 8, 1997, as set forth below:

                         SECTION II - PLAN PARTICIPANTS

         Each Nonemployee Director shall become a Participant under the Plan by
filing the written Election Form described in Section III below with the Plan
Administrator appointed by the Compensation Committee of the Board ("Committee")
with respect to the Retainers and Meeting Fees payable to the Nonemployee
Director for his services as a member of the Board.

                        SECTION III - DEFERRAL ELECTIONS

         (a)      Each Participant shall make the following election with
respect to his Retainer:

                  (i)      The Participant may elect to defer receipt of his
         entire Retainer until the date on which his service on the Board
         terminates for any reason, and have the cash value of such Retainer
         credited to the Stock Unit Account established for him under the Plan
         and converted to Stock Units, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
         (a) of Section IV below; or

                  (ii)     If an election is not made pursuant to clause (i)
         above, a Participant shall

<PAGE>

         receive distribution of a number of shares of common stock of AAR CORP.
         ("Common Stock") equal to the cash value of each quarterly payment of
         his Retainer divided by the Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph
         (b) of Section VIII) of a share of Common Stock on the date on which
         such quarterly payment of such Retainer is payable. Such distribution
         shall be evidenced by a certificate representing the applicable number
         of shares of Common Stock, registered in the name of the Participant,
         and distributed to the Participant as soon as practicable after the
         date on which each quarterly payment of such Retainer is payable.

         (b)      Each Participant shall elect (i) to have his entire Meeting
Fee paid to him in cash as soon as practicable after the date on which such
Meeting Fee is otherwise payable, or (ii) to defer receipt of his entire Meeting
Fee until the date on which his service on the Board terminates for any reason,
and have the cash value of such Meeting Fee credited to the Cash Account
established for him under the Plan pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)
of Section IV below.

         (c)      Each election with respect to a Retainer and Meeting Fee for a
calendar year shall be set forth on an Election Form provided by the Plan
Administrator. Such Election Form shall be in writing and shall specify the
elections described above with respect to Retainers and Meeting Fees.

         (d)      An Election Form effective for a calendar year shall be
delivered to the Plan Administrator prior to the first day of such calendar
year. An Election Form shall remain in effect for subsequent calendar years
until a written notice to revise the Election Form is delivered to the Plan
Administrator on or before the first day of the calendar year in which the
revision is


                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

to become effective. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below, an initial
Election Form or a revised Election Form shall only apply to a Retainer or
Meeting Fee otherwise payable to a Participant after the end of the calendar
year in which such initial or revised Election Form is delivered to the Plan
Administrator. Any Election Form delivered by a Participant shall be irrevocable
with respect to any Retainer or Meeting Fee covered by the elections set forth
therein. If an Election Form is not in effect for a Nonemployee Director for a
calendar year, he shall be deemed to have elected the options specified in
clause (i) of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section for such calendar year.

         (e)      Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section:

                  (i)      An election by a Participant with respect to a
         Retainer or Meeting Fee payable on or after April 8, 1997 may be made
         pursuant to an Election Form delivered to the Plan Administrator prior
         to April 8, 1997; and

                  (ii)     An election made by a Participant in the calendar
         year in which he first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan may
         be made pursuant to an Election Form delivered to the Plan
         Administrator within 30 days after the date on which he initially
         becomes eligible to participate, and such Election Form shall be
         effective with respect to Retainers and Meeting Fees earned from and
         after the date such Election Form is delivered to the Plan
         Administrator.

         (f)      All Retainers and Meeting Fees deferred by a Participant
pursuant to the provisions of the Plan prior to April 8, 1997, shall be credited
to the Cash Account established for the Participant under the Plan.

                        SECTION IV - PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTS

         (a)      (i)      A Retainer of a Participant deferred pursuant to
clause (i) of paragraph (a) of Section III shall be credited as a dollar amount
to the Participant's Stock Unit Account as of the quarterly date on which each
quarterly payment of such Retainer otherwise would have been paid, and shall be
converted as of such date into Stock Units equivalent to Common Stock. Such
conversion shall be determined by dividing the dollar balance of the quarterly
payment of such Retainer by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on
such quarterly date. The number of Stock Units for full shares of Common Stock
so determined shall be credited to the Participant's Stock Unit Account and the
aggregate value thereof shall be charged to the cash balance of his Stock Unit
Account. Any cash balance remaining in the Participant's Stock Unit Account
after such conversion, together with other subsequent credits of deferred
Retainers thereto and credits thereto pursuant to clause (ii) next below, shall
be converted into Stock Units on the next quarterly conversion date.

                  (ii)     Additional credits shall be made to a Participant's
Stock Unit Account in dollar amounts equal to the cash dividends (or the fair
market value of dividends paid in property other than Common Stock) that the
Participant would have received had he been the owner on each record date of a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Stock Units in his Stock
Unit Account on such date. In the case of a dividend in Common Stock or a Common
Stock split, additional credits will be made to a Participant's Stock Unit
Account of a number of Stock Units equal to the number of full shares of Common
Stock that the Participant would have received had he been the owner on each
record date of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Stock
Units in his Stock Unit Account on such date. Any cash dividends


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

(or dividends paid in property other than Common Stock) shall be converted into
Stock Units at the next quarterly conversion date as set forth in clause (i) of
this paragraph.

         (b)      A Meeting Fee of a Participant deferred pursuant to clause
(ii) of paragraph (b) of Section III shall be credited to the Participant's Cash
Account as of the date it would otherwise have been paid. Until the entire
balance of a Cash Account has been paid to the Participant, or to the
beneficiaries of a deceased Participant, such balance shall be increased on the
last day of each calendar quarter to reflect accrued interest on such balance
based on the 10 year United States Treasury Bond rate at the end of the
applicable calendar quarter. The Committee may, from time to time, change
prospectively the interest rate applied with respect to Participants' Cash
Balance Accounts.

         (c)      Each Stock Unit Account and each Cash Account shall be
maintained on the books of the Company until full payment of the balance thereof
has been made to the applicable Participant (or the beneficiaries of a deceased
Participant). No funds shall be set aside or earmarked for any Account, which
shall be purely a bookkeeping device.

                      SECTION V - DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS

         (a)      The entire balance of a Participant's Stock Unit Account and
of his Cash Account shall be paid to him (or to his beneficiaries in the event
of his death) in a single lump sum as of the January 31 next following the date
the Participant's service on the Board terminates for any reason.

         (b)      The balance of a Participant's Stock Unit Account shall be
distributed in shares of Common Stock or in cash as designated by the
Participant (or his beneficiaries in the event of his


                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>

death) by written notice delivered to the Plan Administrator prior to the
applicable January 31 distribution date. If a timely designation is not received
by the Plan Administrator, distribution shall be made in cash or in Common Stock
as the Company shall decide. In the event of a distribution in Common Stock, a
certificate representing a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number
of Stock Units in the Participant's Stock Unit Account, registered in the name
of the Participant (or his beneficiaries), and any remaining cash in the Stock
Unit Account, shall be distributed to the Participant (or his beneficiaries). In
the event of a cash distribution, the Participant (or his beneficiaries) shall
receive an amount in cash equal to the aggregate of (i) the number of Stock
Units in the Stock Unit Account multiplied by the Fair Market Value of a share
of Common Stock on the applicable January 31, and (ii) any remaining cash in the
Stock Unit Account.

         (c)      The balance of a Participant's Cash Account shall be
distributed to the Participant (or his beneficiaries) in cash on the applicable
January 31 distribution date.

         (d)      If a Participant's service on the Board shall terminate by
reason of his death, or if he shall die after becoming entitled to distribution
hereunder, but prior to receipt of his entire distribution, all cash or Common
Stock then distributable hereunder with respect to him shall be distributed to
such beneficiary or beneficiaries as such Participant shall have designated by
an instrument in writing last filed with the Committee prior to his death, or in
the absence of such designation or of any living beneficiary, to his spouse, or
if not then living, to his then living descendants, PER STIRPES, or if none is
then living, to the personal representative of his estate, in the same manner as
would have been distributed to the Participant had he continued to live.

         (e)      In the written discretion of the Plan Administrator, and at
the written request of a Participant, up to 100% of the balance in his Stock
Unit Account and in his Cash Account,


                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

determined as of the last day of the calendar month prior to the date of
distribution, may be distributed to a Participant in a lump sum in the case of
an Unforeseeable Emergency, subject to the limitations set forth below. For
purposes of this paragraph an Unforeseeable Emergency is a severe financial
hardship of the Participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or
accident of the Participant or of a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code) of the Participant, loss of the Participant's
property due to casualty or other similar, extraordinary and unforeseeable
circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the
Participant. The circumstances that will constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency
will depend upon the facts of each case, as determined by the Plan Administrator
in its discretion, but in any case payment may not be made to the extent that
such hardship is or may be relieved:

                  (i)      through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
         otherwise;

                  (ii)     by liquidation of the Participant's assets to the
         extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe
         financial hardship; or

                  (iii)    by cessation of deferrals under the Plan.

Withdrawal of amounts because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be permitted
only to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency.

         (f)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the entire
balance of each Participant's Stock Unit Account and Cash Account shall be
distributed to such Participant on the earlier to occur of (1) within 10 days
after the date the Board, in its discretion, deems a Change in Control of the
Company likely to occur, and (2) the date a Change in Control actually occurs.
Distribution of each Participant's Cash Account shall be made in cash.
Distribution of each Participant's Stock Unit Account shall be made in shares of
Common Stock or in cash as


                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>

designated by the Participant (or his beneficiaries in the event of his death)
pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section V;
provided that the references to "the applicable January 31" in paragraph (b)
shall be references to the date set forth in this paragraph for distribution of
the Participant's Stock Unit Account. For purposes of this paragraph (f), the
definition of a Change in Control of the Company shall be the same as that found
in the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan, as amended and restated from time to time.

                     SECTION VI - ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         (a)      The Committee shall appoint one or more employees of the
Company to act as the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall be
responsible for the general operation and administration of the Plan, and shall
have such powers as are necessary to discharge its duties under the Plan,
including, without limitation, the following:

                  (i)      with the advice of the General Counsel of the
         Company, to construe and interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of
         eligibility, to determine the amount, manner and time of payment of any
         benefits hereunder, to prescribe rules and procedures to be followed by
         Participants and their beneficiaries under the Plan, and to otherwise
         to carry out the purposes of the Plan; and

                  (ii)     To appoint or employ individuals to assist in the
         administration of the Plan and any other agents deemed advisable.

The decisions of the Plan Administrator shall be binding and conclusive upon all
Participants, beneficiaries and other persons.

         (b)      Any Participant claiming a benefit, requesting an
interpretation or ruling, or


                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>

requesting information, under the Plan, shall present the request in writing to
the Plan Administrator, which shall respond in writing as soon as practicable.
If the claim or request is denied, the written notice of denial shall state the
following:

                  (i)      The reasons for denial, with specific reference to
         the Plan provisions upon which the denial is based;

                  (ii)     A description of any additional material or
         information required and an explanation of why it is necessary; and

                  (iii)    An explanation of the Plan's review procedure.

The initial notice of denial shall normally be given within 90 days after
receipt of the claim. If special circumstances require an extension of time, the
claimant shall be so notified and the time limit shall be 180 days. Any person
whose claim or request is denied, or who has not received a response within 30
days, may request review by notice in writing to the Plan Administrator. The
original decision shall be reviewed by the Plan Administrator, which may, but
shall not be required to, grant the claimant a hearing. On review, whether or
not there is a hearing, the claimant may have representation, examine pertinent
documents and submit issues and comments in writing. The decision on review
shall ordinarily be made within 60 days. If an extension of time is required for
a hearing or other special circumstances, the claimant shall be so notified and
the time limit shall be extended to 120 days. The decision on review shall be in
writing and shall state the reasons and the relevant Plan provisions. All
decisions on review shall be final and bind all parties concerned.

                     SECTION VII - AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION

         (a)      The Company intends the Plan to be permanent but reserves the
right to amend or terminate the Plan when, in the sole opinion of the Company,
such amendment or termination is advisable. Any such amendment or termination
shall be made pursuant to a resolution of the Board and shall be effective as of
the date of such resolution or such later date as the resolution may expressly
state.

         (b)      No amendment or termination of the Plan shall (i) directly or
indirectly deprive any current or former Participant or his beneficiaries of all
or any portion of his Accounts as determined as of the effective date of such
amendment or termination, or (ii) directly or indirectly reduce the balance of
any Account held hereunder as of the effective date of such amendment or
termination. Upon termination of the Plan, distribution of balances in all
Accounts shall be made to Participants or their beneficiaries in the manner and
at the time described in Section V as if each Participant's service on the Board
had then terminated. No additional deferred Retainers or Meeting Fees shall be
credited to the Accounts of Participants after termination of the Plan, but the
Company shall continue to credit earnings, gains and losses to Accounts pursuant
to Section IV until the balances of such Accounts have been fully distributed to
Participants or their beneficiaries.

                        SECTION VIII - GENERAL PROVISIONS

         (a)      The Plan at all times shall be entirely unfunded and no
provision shall at any time be made with respect to segregating any assets of
the Company for payment of any benefits hereunder. The right of a Participant or
his beneficiary to receive a benefit hereunder shall be an


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>

unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the
Participant nor a beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any specific
assets of the Company. All amounts credited to Accounts shall constitute general
assets of the Company.

         (b)      For all purposes of the Plan, the Fair Market Value of a share
of Common Stock as of a given date shall be the closing price per share of the
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on such date, or if such date is not
a regular trading date on such Exchange, on the next following regular trading
date.

         (c)      Shares of Common Stock distributed under the Plan may be
treasury shares of the Company or shares purchased by the Company on the open
market. The Company shall reserve such number of shares of Common Stock as may
be issuable under the Plan.

         (d)      Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guaranty by
the Company, the Committee, the Plan Administrator, or any other person or
entity, that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to pay any benefit
hereunder. No Participant or beneficiary shall have any right to receive a
distribution under the Plan except in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

         (e)      Establishment of the Plan shall not be construed to give any
Participant the right to be retained as a member of the Board.

         (f)      No interest of any person or entity in, or right to receive a
distribution under, the Plan, shall be subject in any manner to sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance
of any kind; nor may such interest or right to receive a distribution be taken,
either voluntarily or involuntarily, for the satisfaction of the debts of, or
other obligations or claims against, such person or entity, including claims for
alimony, support, separate maintenance and claims in bankruptcy proceedings.


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

         (g)      The Plan shall be construed and administered under the laws of
the State of Illinois, except to the extent preempted by federal law.

         (h)      If any person entitled to a payment under the Plan is deemed
by the Company to be incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid
receipt for such payment, then, unless and until claim therefor shall have been
made by a duly appointed guardian or other legal representative of such person,
the Company may provide for such payment or any part thereof to be made to any
other person or institution that is contributing toward or providing for the
care and maintenance of such person. Any such payment shall be a payment for the
account of such person and a complete discharge of any liability of the Company,
the Committee, the Plan Administrator and the Plan therefor.

         (i)      The Plan shall be continued, following a transfer or sale of
assets of the Company, or following the merger or consolidation of the Company
into or with any other corporation or entity, by the transferee, purchaser or
successor entity, unless the Plan has been terminated by the Company pursuant to
the provisions of Section VII prior to the effective date of such transaction.

         (j)      Each Participant or beneficiary shall keep the Plan
Administrator informed of his current address. The Plan Administrator shall not
be obligated to search for the whereabouts of any person. If the location of a
Participant is not made known to the Plan Administrator within three years after
the date on which payment of the Participant's benefits under the Plan may first
be made, payment may be made as though the Participant had died at the end of
the three year period. If, within one additional year after such three year
period has elapsed, or, within three years after the actual death of a
Participant, the Plan Administrator is unable to locate any beneficiary of the
Participant, then the Company shall have no further obligation to pay any


                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

benefit hereunder to such Participant, or beneficiary or any other person and
such benefit shall be forfeited. If such Participant, or his beneficiary or any
other person, subsequently makes a valid claim for distribution of the amount
forfeited, such amount, without gains or earnings thereon, shall be distributed
to such Participant or his beneficiary or such other person pursuant to Section
V.

         (k)      Notwithstanding any of the preceding provisions of the Plan,
none of the Company, any member of the Committee, any Plan Administrator or any
individual acting as an employee or agent of the Company, the Committee or the
Plan Administrator, shall be liable to any Participant, former Participant, or
any beneficiary or other person for any claim, loss, liability or expense
incurred by such Participant, or beneficiary or other person in connection with
the Plan.

         (l)      The aggregate number of Stock Units that may be issuable under
the Plan and the number of Stock Units in each Stock Unit Account shall all be
appropriately adjusted as the Committee may determine for any increase or
decrease in the number of shares of issued Common Stock resulting from a
subdivision or consolidation of shares, whether through reorganization,
recapitalization, stock split-up, spin-off, stock distribution or combination of
shares or other increase or decrease in the number of such shares outstanding
effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. Adjustments under this
paragraph (l) shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee, and its
decisions shall be binding and conclusive.

         (m)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Plan, (a) if the Internal Revenue Service prevails in a claim by it that amounts
credited to a Participant's Account, and/or earnings thereon, constitute taxable
income to the Participant or his beneficiary for any taxable


                                     - 13 -

year of his, prior to the taxable year in which such credits and/or earnings are
distributed to him or (b) legal counsel satisfactory to the Company, and the
applicable Participant or his beneficiary, renders an opinion that the Internal
Revenue Service would likely prevail in such a claim, the balance of such
Participant's Account shall be immediately distributed to the Participant or his
beneficiary. For purposes of this paragraph, the Internal Revenue Service shall
be deemed to have prevailed in a claim if such claim is upheld by a court of
final jurisdiction, or if the Company, or a Participant or beneficiary, based
upon an opinion of legal counsel satisfactory to the Company and the Participant
or his beneficiary, fails to appeal a decision of the Internal Revenue Service,
or a court of applicable jurisdiction, with respect to such claim, to an
appropriate Internal Revenue Service appeals authority or to a court of higher
jurisdiction, within the appropriate time period.

         (n)      The Company shall withhold from any deferred or nondeferred
Retainer or Meeting Fee, or any payments made pursuant to Section V, any amounts
required by applicable federal, state and local tax laws and regulations
thereunder. A Participant may pay any applicable taxes due with respect to any
shares of Common Stock distributed under the Plan in cash or in Common Stock,
either by having the Company withhold a portion of the shares of Common Stock
otherwise distributable, or by delivering to the Company shares of Common Stock
otherwise owned by the Participant.

         (o)      Any notice under the Plan shall be in writing, or by
electronic means, and shall be received when actually delivered, or mailed
postage paid as first class U.S. Mail. Notices shall be directed to the Company
at its principal business office at One AAR Place, 1100 North Wood Dale Road,
Wood Dale, Illinois 60191, to a Nonemployee Director at the address stated in
his

Election Form, and to a beneficiary entitled to benefits at the address stated
in the Participant's beneficiary designation, or to such other addresses any
party may specify by notice to the other parties.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this amendment and restatement of the Plan has been
executed on behalf of the Company on this 9th day of April, 1997.
