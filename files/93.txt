<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October&nbsp;1982. AMR&#146;s
operations fall almost entirely in the airline industry. AMR&#146;s principal
subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines), was founded in 1934.
On April&nbsp;9, 2001, American Airlines (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA
Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed
certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), the eighth largest
U.S. carrier. American Airlines, including TWA LLC (collectively, American),
is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2003,
American provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations
throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific.
American is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the
world, providing a wide range of freight and mail services to shippers
throughout its system.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, AMR Eagle Holding Corporation (AMR Eagle), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AMR, owns two regional airlines, which do business as &#147;American
Eagle&#148; &#151; American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc.
(Executive) (collectively, the American Eagle carriers). American also
contracts with three independently owned regional airlines, which do business
as the &#147;American Connection&#148; (the American Connection carriers). The American
Eagle carriers and the American Connection carriers provide connecting service
from eight of American&#146;s high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the
United States, Canada and the Caribbean.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AMR Investment Services, Inc. (AMR Investment), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
AMR, is responsible for the investment and oversight of assets of AMR&#146;s
employee benefit plans, as well as its short-term investments. It also serves
as the investment manager of the American AAdvantage Funds, a family of mutual
funds with both institutional and retail shareholders, and provides customized
fixed income portfolio management services. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, AMR
Investment was responsible for management of approximately $30.2&nbsp;billion in
assets, including direct management of approximately $14.3&nbsp;billion in
short-term fixed income investments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><u><B>A. Recent Events</B></u>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The events of the past several years have had a material adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s finances. The Company incurred operating losses of $0.8&nbsp;billion,
$3.3&nbsp;billion and $2.5&nbsp;billion for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The Company incurred net losses of $1.2&nbsp;billion, $3.5
billion and $1.8&nbsp;billion for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These losses reflect, among other things, a substantial decrease in the
Company&#146;s revenues, which began in early 2001. The revenue decrease has been
driven by a number of factors, some of which the Company believes will persist
indefinitely or permanently. These factors include: (i)&nbsp;a steep fall-off in
the demand for air travel, particularly business travel, primarily caused by
weakness in the U.S. economy, (ii)&nbsp;reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from
greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business
travelers, increasing competition from low-cost carriers (LCCs) and the
continuing increase in pricing transparency resulting from the use of the
Internet and (iii)&nbsp;the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September&nbsp;11,
2001, which accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand and
reduced industry revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In response to decreased demand following the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, the
Company reduced its operating schedule by approximately 20&nbsp;percent and reduced
its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs. Subsequent to these reductions, the
Company determined that achieving $4&nbsp;billion in annual capacity-independent
cost savings was necessary to offset the revenue decline and initiated the

    <TD>In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its
annual costs by $2&nbsp;billion. These initiatives are being implemented
through 2005, and involve: (i)&nbsp;scheduling efficiencies, including the
de-peaking of certain of its hubs, (ii)&nbsp;fleet simplification, (iii)
streamlined customer interaction, (iv)&nbsp;distribution modifications, (v)
in-flight product changes, (vi)&nbsp;operational changes and (vii)
headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of the initiatives,
the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March&nbsp;2003.</TD>

    <TD>In February&nbsp;2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion
in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and
work rules. In April&nbsp;2003, American reached agreements with its three unions
and also implemented various changes in the pay plans and benefits for
non-unionized personnel, including officers and other management. In
addition, the Company and American reached concessionary agreements with
certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively, the Vendors,
and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements), resulting in approximately $200
million in annual cost savings. Generally, under the terms of these Vendor
Agreements, the Company or American receives the benefit of lower rates and
charges for certain goods and services, and more favorable rent and financing
terms with respect to certain of its aircraft.</TD>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2003, in conjunction with some improvement in the U.S.
economy, the Company&#146;s revenue environment began to improve, as reflected in
higher unit revenues (revenue per available seat mile) in May through December
2003, when compared to May through December&nbsp;2002, respectively. Even with this
improvement, however, the Company&#146;s revenues remain depressed relative to
historical levels. The Company therefore needs to see continued improvement in
the revenue environment, additional cost reductions and further productivity
improvements before it can return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2003, the Company announced the Turnaround Plan, a four tenet plan designed
to achieve sustained profitability.

    <TD><B>Lower Costs To Compete: </B>As discussed above, one of the Company&#146;s
critical goals is to reduce costs by $4&nbsp;billion annually, including $2
billion from strategic initiatives, $1.8&nbsp;billion from labor cost
savings and $200&nbsp;million from vendors, suppliers and creditors.
Progress toward this goal helped the Company achieve a significant
year-over-year decline in costs per available seat mile in the fourth
quarter of 2003 and in 2003 as a whole. If not for rising fuel prices,
the Company&#146;s progress in reducing costs would have been even more
significant. The Company has returned underused gate space,
consolidated terminal space, de-peaked its Chicago and Dallas/Fort
Worth hub schedules (with its Miami hub to be de-peaked in 2004),
closed a reservations center, reduced the size of its St. Louis hub,
accelerated the retirement of certain aircraft, and improved aircraft
utilization across its fleet.</TD>

American&#146;s Boeing 757 and Airbus A300 fleets and restructuring the

expanding alliances. The Company&#146;s progress includes a domestic

including capital expenditures and commitments. However, to
maintain sufficient liquidity over the long-term as the Company continues to implement the
Turnaround Plan and seeks to return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels, the Company will need continued access to additional funding. In
addition, the Company&#146;s ability to return to sustained profitability at
acceptable levels will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are
largely beyond the Company&#146;s control. Some of the risk factors that have had
and/or may have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s business and financial
results are discussed in Risk Factors under Item&nbsp;7. In particular, if the
revenue environment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Company
is unable to access the capital markets, it may be unable to fund its
obligations and sustain its operations in the long-term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><u><B>B. Competition</B></u>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Major Competitors </B>The domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive.
Currently, any U.S. air carrier deemed fit by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT)&nbsp;is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any
two points within the U.S. and its possessions. Most major air carriers have
developed hub-and-spoke systems and schedule patterns in an effort to maximize
the revenue potential of their service. American operates five hubs:
Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O&#146;Hare, Miami, St. Louis and San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Delta Air Lines (Delta) and United Air Lines (United) also have hub
operations at DFW and Chicago O&#146;Hare, respectively. The American Eagle carriers
increase the number of markets the Company serves by providing connections at
American&#146;s hubs and certain other major airports &#151; Boston, Los Angeles,
Raleigh/Durham and New York&#146;s LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International
Airports. The American Connection carriers provide connecting service to
American through St. Louis. American&#146;s competitors also own or have marketing
agreements with regional carriers which provide similar services at their major
hubs and other locations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On most of its domestic non-stop routes, the Company faces competing service
from at least one, and sometimes more than one domestic airline including:
AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, America West Airlines, ATA Airlines,
Continental Airlines (Continental), Delta, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways,
Northwest Airlines (Northwest), Southwest Airlines, United and US Airways, and
their affiliated regional carriers. Competition is even greater between cities
that require a connection, where the major airlines may compete via their
respective hubs. In addition, the Company faces competition on some of its
routes from carriers operating point-to-point service on such routes. The
Company also competes with all-cargo and charter carriers and, particularly on
shorter segments, ground transportation. On all of its routes, pricing
decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from
other airlines.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>International Air Transportation </B>In addition to its extensive domestic
service, the Company provides international service to the Caribbean, Canada,
Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. The Company&#146;s operating revenues from
foreign operations were approximately 27&nbsp;percent of the Company&#146;s total
operating revenues in 2003 and 28&nbsp;percent of the Company&#146;s total operating
revenues in 2002 and 2001. Additional information about the Company&#146;s foreign
operations is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In providing international air transportation, the Company competes with
foreign investor-owned carriers, state-owned carriers and U.S. airlines that
have been granted authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service
between the U.S. and various overseas locations. The major U.S. air carriers
have some advantage over foreign competitors in their ability to generate
traffic from their extensive domestic route systems. In many cases, however,
foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers&#146; rights to carry passengers beyond
designated gateway cities in foreign countries. To improve access to each
other&#146;s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers &#151; including American -
have established marketing relationships with other airlines and rail
companies. American currently has marketing relationships with Aer Lingus, Air
Pacific, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific,
China Eastern Airlines, Deutsche Bahn, EL AL, EVA Air, Finnair, Gulf Air,
Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LanChile, Mexicana (planned launch
in April&nbsp;2004, subject to governmental approvals), Qantas Airways, SN Brussels,
SNCF, Southern Winds, Swiss International Air Lines, TACA Group, the TAM Group,
Thalys and Turkish Airlines. In the coming years, the Company expects to
develop these programs further and to evaluate new alliances with other
carriers.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American is also a founding member of the <B>one</B>world alliance, which includes Aer
Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, LanChile, Iberia, and Qantas.
On September&nbsp;23, 2003, the alliance announced its intention for Swiss
International Air Lines to join <B>one</B>world in 2004. The <B>one</B>world alliance links
the networks of the member carriers to enhance customer service and smooth
connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the
carriers&#146; frequent flyer programs and access to the carriers&#146; airport lounge
facilities. Several of American&#146;s major competitors are members of
marketing/operational alliances that enjoy antitrust immunity. To the extent
that American and British Airways, the largest members of the <B>one</B>world
alliance, are restricted in their relationship because they lack antitrust
immunity, the carriers are at a competitive disadvantage vis-&#224;-vis other
alliances that have antitrust immunity. On May&nbsp;30, 2003, the DOT finalized an
order giving American and British Airways permission to codeshare on a wide
number of flights beyond the carriers&#146; gateways in the United Kingdom and the
United States. On September&nbsp;17, 2003, the carriers implemented their first
phase of codeshare services and plan to expand this cooperation further in
2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Price Competition </B>The airline industry is characterized by substantial price
competition. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative
effect on the Company&#146;s financial results because the Company is generally
required to match competitors&#146; fares to maintain passenger traffic. During
recent years, a number of new LCCs have entered the domestic market and several
major airlines, including the Company, have implemented efforts to lower their
costs. In addition, several air carriers have recently reorganized or are
reorganizing under Chapter&nbsp;11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including
United and US Airways. In the past, air carriers involved in reorganizations
have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to maintain cash flows
and enhance customer loyalty. Further fare reductions, domestic and
international, may therefore occur in the future. If fare reductions are not
offset by increases in passenger traffic, changes in the mix of traffic that
improve yields (passenger revenue per passenger mile) and/or cost reductions,
the Company&#146;s operating results will be negatively impacted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Distribution Systems </B>The growing use of electronic ticket distribution
systems provides the Company with an opportunity to lower its distribution
costs. However, the continuous increase in pricing transparency resulting from
use of the Internet has enabled cost-conscious customers to more easily obtain
the lowest fare on any given route. The Company continues to expand the
capabilities of its Internet website &#151; AA.com &#151; and the use of electronic
ticketing throughout the Company&#146;s network. In addition, the Company, along
with United, Continental, Delta and Northwest, owns an interest in Orbitz, a
travel planning website. Orbitz provides online access to airline, hotel, car
rental and other travel services. The Company also has marketing agreements
with other Internet travel services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The majority of the tickets for travel on American and American Eagle are sold
by travel agents. On March&nbsp;18, 2002, American announced that it would no longer
pay base commissions on tickets issued by travel agents in the United States,
Puerto Rico, and Canada (which generally were five percent of the price of a
ticket, capped at a maximum of $20 for a domestic roundtrip itinerary and $100
for an international roundtrip). As discussed in Item&nbsp;3 Legal Proceedings, the
Company is subject to legal challenges related to these changes. American
continues, however, to pay certain commissions to travel agents in connection
with special revenue programs. American believes that other domestic carriers
also no longer pay base commissions on tickets issued by travel agents in the
U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, but pay certain commissions in connection with
their own special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete, not only
with respect to the price of the tickets sold, but also with respect to the
amount of special revenue program commissions that may be paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><u><B>C. Regulation</B></u>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>General </B>The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, as amended, eliminated most
domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation. However,
the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)&nbsp;still exercise certain
regulatory authority over air carriers. The DOT maintains jurisdiction over
the approval of international codeshare agreements, international route
authorities and certain consumer protection and unfair competition matters,
such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing
personnel, aircraft and certain security standards. As part of that oversight,
the FAA has implemented a number of requirements that the Company is
incorporating into its maintenance programs. In 2003, the Company completed
modifications to improve flight deck security on all fleet types. The Company
is progressing toward the completion of over 100 airworthiness directives
including McDonnell Douglas MD-80 metal-mylar insulation replacement, enhanced
ground proximity warning systems, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 main landing gear
piston improvements, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 pylon improvements, Boeing 737
elevator and rudder improvements, inspections to monitor Airbus A300 vertical
stabilizers and Airbus A300 structural improvements. Based on its current
implementation schedule, the Company expects to be in compliance with the
applicable requirements within the required time periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Department of Justice (DOJ)&nbsp;has jurisdiction over airline antitrust
matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the
transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air
transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests
in the National Mediation Board (NMB)&nbsp;certain regulatory functions with respect
to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation
and collective bargaining agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>International </B>International air transportation is subject to extensive
government regulation. The Company&#146;s operating authority in international
markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective
countries or governments, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the
approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover,
alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and
regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral agreements between the U.S.
and various foreign governments of countries served by the Company are
periodically subject to renegotiation. Changes in U.S. or foreign government
aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such
agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, or otherwise adversely
affect the Company&#146;s international operations. In addition, at some foreign
airports, an air carrier needs slots (landing and take-off authorizations)
before the air carrier can introduce new service or increase existing service.
The availability of such slots is not assured and the inability of the Company
to obtain and retain needed slots could therefore inhibit its efforts to
compete in certain international markets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Security </B>In November&nbsp;2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA)
was enacted. The ATSA created a new government agency, the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), which is part of the Department of Homeland
Security and is responsible for aviation security. The ATSA mandates that the
TSA provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including U.S.
mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be
carried aboard a passenger aircraft. The ATSA also provides for increased
security in flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be
present on certain flights.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Effective February&nbsp;1, 2002, the ATSA imposed a $2.50 per enplanement security
service fee ($5 one-way maximum fee), which is being collected by the air
carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security
measures. Additionally, for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, air carriers are
required to submit to the government an amount equal to what the air carriers
paid for screening passengers and property in 2000. After 2004, this fee may
be assessed based upon some other allocation. The Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 temporarily suspended the collection of
these fees from June&nbsp;1, 2003 to September&nbsp;30, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, the ATSA requires air carriers to honor tickets for suspended
service on other air carriers that are insolvent or have declared bankruptcy
within 18&nbsp;months of the passage of the ATSA. The Vision 100 &#151; Century of
Aviation Reauthorization Act, enacted in December&nbsp;2003, extends this provision
to 36&nbsp;months after the passage of the ATSA. To be eligible, a passenger must
make arrangements with the air carrier within 60&nbsp;days after the date on which
the passenger&#146;s air transportation was suspended. This feature of the ATSA
could have a significant impact on the Company. If the Company is not
reimbursed for honoring such tickets, the impact could be adverse.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Airline Fares </B>Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares
without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over international
fares, rates and charges. In addition, international fares and rates are
sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign
countries which the Company serves. While air carriers are required to file
and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs, substantial commissions,
overrides and discounts to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers characterize
many international markets.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Airport Access </B>The FAA has designated New York John F. Kennedy, New York
LaGuardia, and Washington Reagan airports as high-density traffic airports.
The high-density rule limits the number of Instrument Flight Rule operations &#151;
take-offs and landings &#151; permitted per hour and requires that a slot support
each operation. In April&nbsp;2000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and
Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air 21 Act) was enacted. It will eliminate
slot restrictions at New York John F. Kennedy and New York LaGuardia airports
in 2007. The Company does not expect the elimination of these slot
restrictions will have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s operations,
or its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Currently, the FAA permits the purchasing, selling, leasing or transferring of
slots except those slots designated as international, essential air service or
Air 21 Act slots. Trading of any domestic slot is permitted subject to certain
parameters. Most foreign airports, including London Heathrow, a major European
destination for American, also have slot allocations. Most foreign authorities
do not permit the purchasing, selling or leasing of slots.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Although the Company is constrained by slots, it currently has sufficient slot
authorizations to operate its existing flights and has generally been able to
obtain slots to expand its operations and change its schedules. However, there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain slots for these
purposes in the future because, among other factors, slot allocations are
subject to changes in government policies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2004, American reached an agreement with the FAA whereby it agreed
to reduce operations at Chicago O&#146;Hare during certain peak times. The FAA
announced that a similar agreement between the FAA and United was reached.
American does not anticipate that this agreement with the FAA will have any
material impact on its operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Environmental Matters </B>The Company is subject to various laws and government
regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in
the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact
on the Company include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA), the
Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act,
the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or the Superfund Act). The Company is
also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA)&nbsp;concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have
been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the Company&#146;s
operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been
delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many
state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and
health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or stricter than
federal requirements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The ANCA recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to
implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere
unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air
transportation system. Authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft
noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. The
ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft.
While the Company has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate
local noise restrictions imposed to date, the Company&#146;s operations could be
adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or
widespread.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP)&nbsp;for
contamination at the Double Eagle Superfund Site in Oklahoma City, OK.
American&#146;s alleged volumetric contributions are small when compared with those
of other PRPs. American is participating with a number of other PRPs in a
Joint Defense Group that is actively conducting settlement negotiations with
EPA and state officials. The group is seeking a settlement on behalf of its
members that will enable American to resolve its past and present liabilities
at the Site in exchange for a one-time, lump-sum settlement payment. American
expects that its payment will be immaterial.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American, along with most other tenants at the San Francisco International
Airport (SFIA), has been ordered by the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board to engage in various studies of potential environmental
contamination at the airport and to undertake remedial measures, if necessary.
SFIA is also seeking to recover its past costs related to the contamination
from the tenants. American&#146;s potential contribution is unknown, but is not
expected to be material.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating
various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA)&nbsp;and
funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery
methods. American and AMR Eagle have been named PRPs for the contamination at
MIA. During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17
defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past and future
cleanup costs (<u>Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et
al.</u> in the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in
the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and
contributors to the contamination. American&#146;s and AMR Eagle&#146;s portion of the
cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion
of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and
uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately
supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. The
Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 1999, American was ordered by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC)&nbsp;to conduct remediation of environmental contamination
located at Terminals 8 and 9 at New York&#146;s John F. Kennedy International
Airport (JFK). American is seeking to recover a portion of the remediation
costs from previous users of the Terminals 8 and 9 premises. In 2002, American
began negotiating an order with NYSDEC for the remediation of a JFK
off-terminal hangar facility. American does not expect the costs associated
with this remediation to be material.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 1996, American and Executive, along with other tenants at the Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico were notified by the Port
Authority that it considered them potentially responsible for environmental
contamination at the airport. In 2003, the Port Authority requested that
American, among other airport tenants, fund an ongoing subsurface investigation
and site assessment. American denied liability for the related costs. No
further action has been taken against American or Executive.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American Eagle Airlines, Inc. has been notified of its potential liability
under New York law at an inactive hazardous waste site in Poughkeepsie, New
York. Pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent entered into with NYSDEC,
American Eagle is implementing a final remedy to address contamination at the
site. The costs of this final remedy are not material.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company does not expect these matters, individually or collectively, to
have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><u><B>D. Labor</B></u>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The airline business is labor intensive. Wages, salaries and benefits
represented approximately 40&nbsp;percent of the Company&#146;s consolidated operating
expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. The average equivalent number
of employees of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003
was 96,400.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The majority of these employees are represented by labor unions and covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Relations with such labor organizations are
governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under this act, the collective bargaining
agreements among the Company&#146;s subsidiaries and these organizations generally
do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either
party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the
other party in the manner described in the agreement. After receipt of such
notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is
reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB)&nbsp;to appoint
a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may
declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the
NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to
submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day
&#147;cooling off&#148; period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential
Emergency Board (PEB)&nbsp;may be established, which examines the parties&#146; positions
and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30&nbsp;days and is followed
by a &#147;cooling off&#148; period of 30&nbsp;days. At the end of a &#147;cooling off&#148; period,
unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor
organization may strike and the airline may resort to &#147;self-help&#148;, including
the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new
employees to replace the striking workers.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2003, American reached agreements with its three major unions &#151; the
Allied Pilots Association (the APA), the Transport Workers Union of America
(AFL-CIO) (the TWU) and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the
APFA) (the Labor Agreements). The Labor Agreements substantially reduced the
labor costs associated with the employees represented by the unions. In
conjunction with the Labor Agreements, American implemented various changes in
the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and
other management (the Management Reductions). The Labor Agreements will not
become amendable until 2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents American Eagle pilots,
reached agreement with American Eagle effective September&nbsp;1, 1997, to have all
of the pilots of the American Eagle carriers covered by a single collective
bargaining agreement. This agreement lasts until October&nbsp;31, 2013. The
agreement provides to the parties the right to seek limited changes in 2004,
2008 and 2012. If the parties are unable to agree on the limited changes, they
also agreed that the issues would be resolved by interest arbitration, without
the exercise of self-help (such as a strike). ALPA and American Eagle
negotiated a tentative agreement in 2000, but that agreement failed in
ratification. Thereafter, the parties participated in interest arbitration. The
interest arbitration panel determined the limited changes which should be made
and these changes were appropriately effected. The Company expects to begin
negotiations under the agreement in the first quarter of 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which represents the flight
attendants of the American Eagle carriers, reached agreement with American
Eagle effective March&nbsp;2, 1998, to have all flight attendants of the American
Eagle carriers covered by a single contract. The agreement became amendable on
September&nbsp;2, 2001. However, the parties agreed to commence negotiations over
amendments to the agreement in March&nbsp;2001. The mediation assistance of the NMB
was requested and mediation commenced in November&nbsp;2003; mediated negotiations
continue. The other union employees at the American Eagle carriers are covered
by separate agreements with the TWU, which were effective April&nbsp;28, 1998, and
were amendable April&nbsp;28, 2003. American Eagle and the TWU have commenced
negotiations. American Eagle cannot predict the result of the mediation or
these negotiations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The non-union employees formerly with TWA LLC have been integrated into
American&#146;s work force. With respect to the integration of unionized employees
formerly employed by TWA LLC, American reached integration agreements with the
APA (with respect to pilot integration) and the APFA (with respect to flight
attendant integration). American and the TWU participated in arbitration and
resolved certain unionized ground employee integration issues in late February
and early March&nbsp;2002. In early April&nbsp;2002, the NMB declared American and TWA
LLC a single carrier for labor relations purposes and designated American&#146;s
incumbent unions as the collective bargaining representatives of the relevant
work groups at both American and TWA LLC. Since American&#146;s unions thereafter
represented the relevant employees at both carriers, the integration mechanisms
applicable to the unions at American could then begin to be effected. The
integration of the unionized work groups is occurring in accordance with those
mechanisms.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s operations and financial results are significantly affected by
the availability and price of jet fuel. The Company&#146;s fuel costs and
consumption for the years 2001 through 2003 were:

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The impact of fuel price changes on the Company and its competitors depends on
various factors, including hedging strategies. The Company has a fuel hedging
program in which it enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil swap and
option contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility of jet fuel prices.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company&#146;s fuel hedging program reduced the
Company&#146;s fuel expense by approximately $149&nbsp;million, $4&nbsp;million and $29
million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had hedged, with
option contracts, approximately 21&nbsp;percent of its estimated first quarter 2004
fuel requirements, 16&nbsp;percent of its second quarter 2004 estimated fuel
requirements and six percent of its estimated fuel requirements for the
remainder of 2004. The Company&#146;s credit rating, as discussed in Liquidity and
Capital Resources under Item&nbsp;7, has limited its ability to enter into certain
types of fuel hedge contracts. A further deterioration of its credit rating or
liquidity position may negatively affect the Company&#146;s ability to hedge fuel in
the future. See the Risk Factors under Item&nbsp;7 for information regarding fuel.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Additional information regarding the Company&#146;s fuel program is also included in
Item&nbsp;7(A) &#151; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><u><B>F. Frequent Flyer Program</B></u>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American established the AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) to
develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued
patronage. The Company believes that the AAdvantage program is one of its
competitive strengths. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits for flights on
American, American Eagle and certain other participating airlines, or by using
services of other program participants, including bank credit card issuers,
hotels, car rental companies and phone service companies. American sells
mileage credits and related services to the other companies participating in
the program. American reserves the right to change the AAdvantage program at
any time without notice and end the program with six months notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel on
American, American Eagle or participating airlines, or for other travel
industry awards. Once a member accrues sufficient mileage for an award, the
member may book award travel on American. Most travel awards are subject to
capacity controlled seating. Mileage credit does not expire, provided a
customer has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 36&nbsp;months.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American uses the incremental cost method to account for the portion of its
frequent flyer liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits
by flying on American or American Eagle. American&#146;s frequent flyer liability
is accrued each time a member accumulates sufficient mileage in his or her
account to claim the lowest level of free travel award (25,000 miles) and the
award is expected to be used for free travel. American includes fuel, food,
and reservations/ticketing costs in the calculation of incremental cost. These
estimates are generally updated based upon the Company&#146;s 12-month historical
average of such costs. American also accrues a frequent flier liability for
the mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating
airlines.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenue earned from selling AAdvantage miles to other companies is recognized
in two components. The first component represents the revenue for air
transportation sold and is valued at current market rates. This revenue is
deferred and recognized over the period the mileage is expected to be used,
which is currently estimated to be 28&nbsp;months. The second revenue component,
representing the marketing products sold and administrative costs associated
with operating the AAdvantage program, is recognized immediately.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, American estimated that approximately 9.3
million free travel awards were expected to be redeemed for free travel on
American and American Eagle. In making the estimate of free travel awards,
American has excluded mileage in inactive accounts, mileage related to accounts
that have not yet reached the lowest level of free travel award, and mileage in
active accounts that have reached the lowest level of free travel award but
which are not expected to ever be redeemed for free travel on American or
participating airlines. The Company&#146;s total liability for future AAdvantage
award redemptions for free, discounted or upgraded travel on American, American
Eagle or participating airlines and unrecognized revenue from selling
AAdvantage miles to other companies was approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion (and is
recorded as a component of Air traffic liability in the consolidated balance
sheets), representing 18.8&nbsp;percent and 16.2&nbsp;percent of AMR&#146;s total current
liabilities, at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The number of free travel awards used for travel on American and American Eagle
in 2003 and 2002 was 2.5&nbsp;million and 2.6&nbsp;million, respectively, representing
approximately 7.8&nbsp;percent and 8.1&nbsp;percent of passengers boarded, respectively.
The Company believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the
Company&#146;s load factors, its ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory,
and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><u><B>G. Other Matters</B></u>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Seasonality and Other Factors </B>The Company&#146;s results of operations for any
interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year,
since the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The results of operations in the air transportation business have also
significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic
conditions. In addition, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives,
fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather and other factors could
impact this seasonal pattern. Unaudited quarterly financial data for the
two-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 is included in Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">No material part of the business of AMR and its subsidiaries is dependent upon
a single customer or very few customers. Consequently, the loss of the
Company&#146;s largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon
the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Insurance </B>The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger
liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As a result of the September&nbsp;11, 2001 events, aviation insurers significantly
reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers
for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims
resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage).
At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the premiums for
aviation insurance in general.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for
U.S. based airlines until August&nbsp;31, 2004 covering losses to employees,
passengers, third parties and aircraft. In addition, the Secretary of
Transportation may extend the policy until December&nbsp;31, 2004, at his
discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the
U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company
will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial
insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at
commercially reasonable rates, the Company&#146;s results of operations would be
negatively affected. In addition, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the
amount of insurance coverage available to the Company, or significantly
increase its cost, the Company&#146;s operations and/or financial position and
results of operations would be adversely affected.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Government Matters </B>In time of war or during a national emergency or
defense oriented situation, American and other air carriers can be required to
provide airlift services to the Air Mobility Command under the Civil Reserve
Air Fleet program (CRAF). The Air Mobility Command, which runs CRAF, activated
Stage I of CRAF as part of the U.S. government&#146;s build-up for military action
in Iraq during 2003. Stage I of CRAF was in effect from February&nbsp;8, 2003 until
June&nbsp;18, 2003. American provided five airplanes, including three 777s and two
767-300s, with crews for Stage I of CRAF, which did not significantly impact
its operations. In the event the Company has to provide a substantial number
of aircraft and crew to the Air Mobility Command, its operations could be
adversely impacted.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On July&nbsp;26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in November&nbsp;1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc.,
AMR Eagle Holding Corporation, Airlines Reporting Corporation, and the Sabre
Group Holdings, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California, Western Division (<u>Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR
Corp., et al.</u>). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay
debit memos to American for violations of American&#146;s fare rules (by customers
of the agencies): (1)&nbsp;breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American
and AMR Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2)&nbsp;constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3)
violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO).
The certified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will be
required to pay money to American for debit memos for fare rules violations
from July&nbsp;26, 1995 to the present. The plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys&#146; fees, and costs. The Company
intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that
the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could impose
restrictions on the Company&#146;s relationships with travel agencies, which could
have an adverse impact on the Company.

Department of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR

AMR Corporation, et al, No.&nbsp;99-1180-JTM, United States District Court for the
District of Kansas</u>). The lawsuit alleged that American unlawfully monopolized
or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport (DFW)&nbsp;by increasing service when new competitors
began flying to DFW, and by matching these new competitors&#146; fares. The
Department of Justice sought to enjoin American from engaging in the alleged
improper conduct and to impose restraints on American to remedy the alleged
effects of its past conduct. On April&nbsp;27, 2001, the U.S. District Court for
the District of Kansas granted American&#146;s motion for summary judgment, and on
July&nbsp;3, 2003, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Department of
Justice did not seek to have the case reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Between May&nbsp;14, 1999 and June&nbsp;7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were filed
against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding
Corporation in the United States District Court in Wichita, Kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys&#146; fees (<u>King v. AMR Corp., et al.</u>; <u>Smith v. AMR Corp., et
al.</u>; <u>Team Electric v. AMR Corp., et al.</u>; <u>Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.</u>; <u>Whittier
v. AMR Corp., et al.</u>; <u>Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.</u>; and <u>Youngdahl v. AMR Corp.,
et al.</u>). Collectively, these lawsuits allege that American unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from
DFW by increasing service when new competitors began flying to DFW, and by
matching these new competitors&#146; fares. Two of the suits (<u>Smith</u> and <u>Wright</u>)
also allege that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize
airline passenger service to and from DFW by offering discounted fares to
corporate purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain
conditions on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering
override commissions to travel agents. The suits propose to certify several
classes of consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased
tickets for air travel on American into or out of DFW from 1995 to the present.
On November&nbsp;10, 1999, the District Court stayed all of these actions pending
developments in the case brought by the Department of Justice (see above
description). In the light of the decision by the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in the Department of Justice case (see immediately preceding
paragraph), the plaintiffs in these class actions have dismissed their claims.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On May&nbsp;17, 2002, the named plaintiffs in <u>Hall, et al. v. United Airlines, et
al.</u>, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
North Carolina, filed an amended complaint alleging that between 1995 and the
present, American and over 15 other defendant airlines conspired to reduce
commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation of Section&nbsp;1 of the
Sherman Act. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.
The court granted class action certification to the plaintiffs on September
17, 2002, defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in the United
States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any time
from October&nbsp;1, 1997 to the present, issued tickets, miscellaneous change
orders, or prepaid ticket advices for travel on any of the defendant airlines.
The case is stayed as to US Airways and United Air Lines, since they filed for
bankruptcy. American is vigorously defending the lawsuit. Defendant carriers
filed a motion for summary judgment on December&nbsp;10, 2002, which the court
granted on October&nbsp;30, 2003. Plaintiffs have appealed that order to the 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals, and that appeal remains pending. A final adverse
court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the Company&#146;s commission policies or practices would have an adverse impact on
the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Between April&nbsp;3, 2003 and June&nbsp;5, 2003, three lawsuits were filed by travel
agents some of whom have opted out of the <u>Hall</u> class action (above)&nbsp;to pursue
their claims individually against American Airlines, Inc., other airline
defendants, and in one case against certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC.
(<u>Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta Air Lines et. al.</u>, in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California &#151; San Francisco (51 individual
agencies), <u>Paula Fausky d/b/a Timeless Travel v. American Airlines, et. al,</u> in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Eastern
Division (29 agencies) and <u>Swope Travel et al. v. Orbitz et. al.</u> in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Beaumont Division (6
agencies)). Collectively, these lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief
alleging that the certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC: (i)&nbsp;conspired to
prevent travel agents from acting as effective competitors in the distribution
of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section&nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act;
(ii)&nbsp;conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air travel
between airports in the United States in violation of Section&nbsp;2 of the Sherman
Act; and that (iii)&nbsp;between 1995 and the present, the airline defendants
conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation
of Section&nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act. These cases have been consolidated in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Eastern
Division. American is vigorously defending these lawsuits. A final adverse
court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the Company&#146;s distribution practices would have an adverse impact on the
Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On April&nbsp;26, 2002, six travel agencies filed <u>Albany Travel Co., et al. v.
Orbitz, LLC, et al.</u>, in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against American, United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines, and
Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other defendants: (i)&nbsp;conspired to
prevent travel agents from acting as effective competitors in the distribution
of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section&nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act;
and (ii)&nbsp;conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air travel
between airports in the United States in violation of Section&nbsp;2 of the Sherman
Act. The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class of travel agents,
but no class has yet been certified. On November&nbsp;25, 2002, the District Court
stayed this case pending a judgment in <u>Hall et. al. v. United Airlines, et. al.</u>
(see above description). In light of the decision of the court in <u>Hall et. al</u>
(discussed above), the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On April&nbsp;25, 2002, a Quebec travel agency filed a motion seeking a declaratory
judgment of the Superior Court in Montreal, Canada (<u>Voyages Montambault (1989)
Inc. v. International Air Transport Association, et al.</u>), that American and the
other airline defendants owe a &#147;fair and reasonable commission&#148; to the agency,
and that American and the other airline defendants breached alleged contracts
with the agency by adopting policies of not paying base commissions. The
motion was subsequently amended to add 40 additional travel agencies as
petitioners. The current defendants are the International Air Transport
Association, the Air Transport Association of Canada, Air Canada, American,
America West Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Grupo TACA, Northwest Airlines/KLM
Airlines, and Continental Airlines. American is vigorously defending the
lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, a
final adverse court decision granting declaratory relief could expose the
Company to claims for substantial money damages or force the Company to pay
agency commissions, either of which would have an adverse impact on the
Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On May&nbsp;13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in <u>Always Travel, et. al. v. Air Canada,
et. al.</u>, pending in the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, Montreal,
filed a statement of claim alleging that between 1995 and the present,
American, the other defendant airlines, and the International Air Transport
Association conspired to reduce commissions paid to Canada-based travel agents
in violation of Section&nbsp;45 of the Competition Act of Canada. The named
plaintiffs seek monetary damages and injunctive relief and seek to certify a
nationwide class of travel agents. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class
certification, but that motion has not yet been decided. American is
vigorously defending the lawsuit. A final adverse court decision awarding
substantial money damages or placing restrictions on the Company&#146;s commission
policies would have an adverse impact on the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On August&nbsp;14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American Airlines,
Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, Western Division (<u>All World Professional Travel Services, Inc. v.
American Airlines, Inc.</u>). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies
to pay debit memos for refunding tickets after September&nbsp;11, 2001: (1)
breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and plaintiff; (2)
constitutes unjust enrichment; and (3)&nbsp;violates the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). The as yet uncertified class
includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay moneys to
American for an &#147;administrative service charge,&#148; &#147;penalty fee,&#148; or other fee
for processing refunds on behalf of passengers who were unable to use their
tickets in the days immediately following the resumption of air carrier service
after the tragedies on September&nbsp;11, 2001. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin
American from collecting the debit memos and to recover the amounts paid for
the debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys&#146; fees, and costs. The Company
intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that
the litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could impose
restrictions on the Company&#146;s relationships with travel agencies which could
have an adverse impact on the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On August&nbsp;19, 2002, a class action lawsuit seeking monetary damages was filed,
and on May&nbsp;7, 2003 an amended complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (<u>Power Travel International, Inc.
v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.</u>) against American, Continental Airlines,
Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, alleging that
American and the other defendants breached their contracts with the agency and
were unjustly enriched when these carriers at various times reduced their base
commissions to zero. The as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies
accredited by the Airlines Reporting Corporation &#147;whose base commissions on
airline tickets were unilaterally reduced to zero by&#148; the defendants. The case
is stayed as to United Air Lines, since it filed for bankruptcy. American is
vigorously defending the lawsuit. Although the Company believes that the
litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision awarding
substantial money damages or forcing the Company to pay agency commissions
would have an adverse impact on the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Miami-Dade County (the County) is currently investigating and remediating
various environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA)&nbsp;and
funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery
methods. American Airlines, Inc. and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA. During the second
quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup
costs (<u>Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et al.</u> in
the Florida Circuit Court). In addition to the 17 defendants named in the
lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and
contributors to the contamination. American&#146;s and AMR Eagle&#146;s portion of the
cleanup costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion
of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and
uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately
supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. The
Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

credit to stockholders equity of approximately $337&nbsp;million for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. Effective after the close of business on March

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These losses reflect, among other things, a substantial decrease in the
Company&#146;s revenues, which began in early 2001. The revenue decrease has been
driven by a number of factors, some of which the Company believes will persist
indefinitely or permanently. These factors include: (i)&nbsp;a steep fall-off in
the demand for air travel, particularly business travel, primarily caused by
weakness in the U.S. economy, (ii)&nbsp;reduced pricing power, resulting mainly from
greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business
travelers, increasing competition from low-cost carriers (LCCs) and the
continuing increase in pricing transparency resulting from the use of the
Internet and (iii)&nbsp;the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September&nbsp;11,
2001, which accelerated and exacerbated the trend of decreased demand and
reduced industry revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In response to decreased demand following the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, the
Company reduced its operating schedule by approximately 20&nbsp;percent and reduced
its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs. Subsequent to these reductions, the
Company determined that achieving $4&nbsp;billion in annual capacity-independent
cost savings was necessary to offset the revenue decline and initiated the
following restructuring activities to realize this goal:

    <TD>In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its
annual costs by $2&nbsp;billion. These initiatives are being implemented
through 2005, and involve: (i)&nbsp;scheduling efficiencies, including the
de-peaking of certain of its hubs, (ii)&nbsp;fleet simplification, (iii)
streamlined customer interaction, (iv)&nbsp;distribution modifications, (v)
in-flight product changes, (vi)&nbsp;operational changes and (vii)
headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of the initiatives,
the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March&nbsp;2003.</TD>

    <TD>In February&nbsp;2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion
in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and
work rules. In April&nbsp;2003, American reached agreements with its three unions
(the Labor Agreements) and also implemented various changes in the pay plans
and benefits for non-unionized personnel, including officers and other
management (the Management Reductions). In addition, the Company and American
reached concessionary agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and
suppliers (collectively, the Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor
Agreements), resulting in approximately $200&nbsp;million in annual cost savings.
Generally, under the terms of these Vendor Agreements, the Company or
American receives the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods
and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect to
certain of its aircraft.</TD>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2003, in conjunction with some improvement in the U.S.
economy, the Company&#146;s revenue environment began to improve, as reflected in
higher unit revenues (revenue per available seat mile) in May through December
2003, when compared to May through December&nbsp;2002, respectively. Even with this
improvement, however, the Company&#146;s revenues remain depressed relative to
historical levels. The Company therefore needs to see continued improvement in
the revenue environment, additional cost reductions and further productivity
improvements before it can return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2003, the Company announced the Turnaround Plan, a four tenet plan designed
to achieve sustained profitability.

    <TD><B>Lower Costs To Compete: </B>As discussed above, one of the Company&#146;s
critical goals is to reduce costs by $4&nbsp;billion annually, including $2
billion from strategic initiatives, $1.8&nbsp;billion from labor cost
savings and $200&nbsp;million from vendors, suppliers and creditors.
Progress toward this goal helped the Company achieve a significant
year-over-year decline in costs per available seat mile in the fourth
quarter of 2003 and in 2003 as a whole. If not for rising fuel prices,
the Company&#146;s progress in reducing costs would have been even more
significant. The Company has returned underused gate space,
consolidated terminal space, de-peaked its Chicago and Dallas/Fort
Worth hub schedules (with its Miami hub to be de-peaked in 2004),
closed a reservations center, reduced the size of its St. Louis hub,
accelerated the retirement of certain aircraft, and improved aircraft
utilization across its fleet.</TD>

including capital expenditures and commitments. However, to
maintain sufficient liquidity over the long-term as the Company continues to implement the
Turnaround Plan and seeks to return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels, the Company will need continued access to additional funding. In
addition, the Company&#146;s ability to return to sustained profitability at
acceptable levels will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are
largely beyond the Company&#146;s control. Some of the risk factors that have had
and/or may have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s business and financial
results are discussed in Risk Factors at the end of this Item. In particular,
if the revenue environment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the
Company is unable to access the capital markets, it may be unable to fund its
obligations and sustain its operations in the long-term.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had $2.6&nbsp;billion in unrestricted cash and
short-term investments and $527&nbsp;million in restricted cash and short-term
investments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had approximately $166

Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Significant Indebtedness and Future Financing </U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company raised an aggregate of approximately
$10.0&nbsp;billion of financing to fund capital commitments (mainly for aircraft and
ground properties) and operating losses. The Company expects that it will need
to continue to raise capital until it has achieved acceptable levels of
sustained profitability over a significant period of time. The Company&#146;s
possible future financing sources include: (i)&nbsp;a limited amount of additional
secured aircraft debt (virtually all of the Company&#146;s Section&nbsp;1110-eligible
aircraft are encumbered), (ii)&nbsp;debt secured by other assets, (iii)
securitization of future operating receipts, (iv)&nbsp;sale-leaseback transactions
of owned aircraft, (v)&nbsp;the potential sale of certain non-core assets, (vi)
unsecured debt and (vii)&nbsp;equity and/or equity-like securities. However, the
availability and level of these financing sources cannot be assured,
particularly in light of the fact that the Company has fewer unencumbered
assets available than it has had in the past. To the extent that the Company&#146;s
revenues deteriorate beyond normal seasonal trends or it is unable to access
capital markets and raise additional capital, the Company may be unable to fund
its obligations and sustain its operations in the long-term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s significant indebtedness could have important consequences, such
as (i)&nbsp;limiting the Company&#146;s ability to obtain additional financing for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general purposes, (ii)
requiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from
operations to payments on its indebtedness, (iii)&nbsp;making the Company more
vulnerable to economic downturns, (iv)&nbsp;limiting its ability to withstand
competitive pressures and reducing its flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions, and (v)&nbsp;limiting the Company&#146;s flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which
it operates.

increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of
future financing.

interest and total rentals) ratio covenant. The required EBITDAR to fixed
charges ratio is 1.1 to 1.0 for the three-month period ending March&nbsp;31, 2004,
and increases on a quarterly basis up to 1.5 to 1.0 for each four consecutive
quarters ending after December&nbsp;31, 2004. The liquidity covenant requires
American to maintain a minimum level of $1.0&nbsp;billion of unrestricted cash and
short-term investments. The Company expects to be able to continue to comply
with these covenants. However, it cannot be sure that it will continue to be
able to do so through the expiration of the facility. Failure to do so would

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31,

federal tax refund and the receipt of $358&nbsp;million from the U.S. government
under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (the Act),
offset by $521&nbsp;million of redemption payments under operating leases for

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2003, the Company sold its interests in Worldspan, a computer

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AMR (principally American) historically operates with a working capital
deficit, as do most other airline companies. In addition, the Company has
historically relied heavily on external financing to fund capital expenditures.
More recently, the Company has also relied on external financing to fund
operating losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Off Balance Sheet Arrangements</U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has completed its evaluation of its interests in variable interest
entities and determined that it holds a significant variable interest in, but
is not the primary beneficiary of, certain trusts that are the lessors under 88
of its aircraft operating leases. These leases contain a fixed price purchase
option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price
on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value of
the aircraft. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, future lease payments required under
these leases totaled $3.2&nbsp;billion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities
primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased
by American and accounted for as operating leases. Approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion
of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $4.8&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $532
million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender
provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to
repurchase the bonds at various times: $112&nbsp;million in 2004, $104&nbsp;million in
2005, $28&nbsp;million in 2006, $100&nbsp;million in 2007 and $188&nbsp;million in 2008.
Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no
assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to
redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce
existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and
would reduce future operating lease commitments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, the Company has other operating leases, primarily for aircraft,
with total future lease payments of $5.4&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.
Entering into aircraft leases allows the Company to obtain aircraft without
immediate cash outflows.

and Trans States Airlines Inc. However, based on expected

2006, $168&nbsp;million in 2007, $170&nbsp;million in 2008 and $854
million in 2009 and beyond. In addition, if the Company
terminates its contract with Chautauqua without cause,
Chautauqua has the right to put its Embraer aircraft to the
Company. If this were to happen, the Company would take
possession of the aircraft and become liable for lease
obligations totaling approximately $21&nbsp;million per year
with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019. These lease
obligations are not included in the table above.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the commitments summarized above, the Company is required to
make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. These contributions
are required under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement
Pension Plan Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company&#146;s estimated 2004 minimum
required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans are approximately
$600&nbsp;million. (This estimate assumes Congress passes legislation providing
certain technical corrections to current ERISA funding requirements.) Due to
uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future
required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans, such as interest
rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns and the impact of proposed
legislation, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate its future required
contributions beyond 2004. However, based on the current regulatory
environment and market conditions, the Company expects that its 2005 minimum
required contributions will significantly exceed its 2004 minimum required
contributions. Congress is also considering other legislation that, if passed,
would further modestly reduce the Company&#146;s 2004 minimum required contributions
and significantly reduce its 2005 minimum required contributions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Agreements with Lessors and Lenders</U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
reached concessionary agreements with certain lessors in 2003. Certain of the
Vendor Agreements provide that the Company&#146;s obligations under the related
lease revert to the original terms if certain events (Events) occur prior to
December&nbsp;31, 2005, including: (i)&nbsp;an event of default under the related lease
(which generally occurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii)&nbsp;an event of
loss with respect to the related aircraft, (iii)&nbsp;rejection by the Company of
the lease under the provisions of Chapter&nbsp;11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
(iv)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s filing for bankruptcy under Chapter&nbsp;7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. If any one of these Events were to occur, the Company would be
responsible for approximately $24&nbsp;million in additional operating lease
payments and $11&nbsp;million in additional payments related to capital leases as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003. This amount will increase to approximately $119&nbsp;million in
operating lease payments and $111&nbsp;million in payments related to capital leases
prior to the expiration of the provision on December&nbsp;31, 2005. These amounts
are being accounted for as contingent rentals and will only be recognized if
they become due.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, as part of the Vendor Agreements, American sold 33 Fokker 100
aircraft (with a minimal net book value), issued a $23&nbsp;million
non-interest-bearing note, payable in installments and maturing in December
2010, entered into short-term leases on these aircraft and issued shares of AMR
common stock as discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
In exchange, approximately $130&nbsp;million of debt related to certain of the
Fokker 100 aircraft was retired. However, the agreement contains provisions
that would require American to repay additional amounts of the original debt if
certain Events occur prior to December&nbsp;31, 2005. As a result of this
transaction, including the sale of the 33 Fokker 100 aircraft, and the
termination of the Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements related to the debt
that has been retired, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $68
million. If none of the Events occur, the Company expects to recognize an
additional gain of approximately $37&nbsp;million in December&nbsp;2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Results of Operations</U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s 2003 results reflect a weak revenue environment, particularly in
the first four months of the year. They also reflect the benefit of the
Company&#146;s cost reduction initiatives, especially the reduction in employee
costs due to the Labor Agreements and Management Reductions that came into
effect in the second quarter of 2003. The Company&#146;s unit costs are now among
the lowest of the major network air carriers, and the Company believes it is
now better positioned to compete against low-cost carriers (LCCs). However, as
discussed in the Overview to this Item, the Company needs to see continued improvement in the
revenue environment, additional cost reductions and further productivity
improvements before it can return to sustained profitability at acceptable
levels.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AMR&#146;s net loss in 2003 was $1.2&nbsp;billion, or $7.76 per share, an improvement of
$2.3&nbsp;billion over AMR&#146;s net loss in 2002 of $3.5&nbsp;billion, or $22.57 per share.
The Company&#146;s 2003 results include several special items which are discussed in
detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including (i)
$358&nbsp;million in security cost reimbursements received under the Act (see Note 2
to the consolidated financial statements), (ii) $407&nbsp;million in special charges
(see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), (iii) $150&nbsp;million in
gains on the sale of the Company&#146;s investments in Hotwire and Orbitz (see Note
3 to the consolidated financial statements) and (iv)&nbsp;a $164&nbsp;million reduction
in previously accrued federal income taxes and related interest. In addition,
the Company did not record a tax benefit associated with its 2003 losses. The
Company&#146;s 2002 results include a one-time, non-cash charge to record the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting, effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, of $988
million, or $6.35 per share, to write-off all of AMR&#146;s goodwill upon the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No.&nbsp;142 &#147;Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements), and special charges of $718&nbsp;million (see Note 2 to the

year-over-year, increasing approximately $20&nbsp;million, or 0.1&nbsp;percent, to $17.4
billion. During the first four months of the year, yields (passenger revenue
per available seat mile) and load factors were down year-over-year, due to the
impact of the war in Iraq and SARS. In the latter part of the year, both
yields and load factors improved year-over-year, as the impact of the war in
Iraq and SARS faded, and the U.S. economy began recovering. However, even with
the recent improvements, the Company&#146;s unit revenues and yield are still
depressed relative to historical measures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For the full year, American&#146;s passenger revenues decreased by 0.7&nbsp;percent, or
$108&nbsp;million, to $14.3&nbsp;billion, on a capacity decrease of 4.1&nbsp;percent to 165
billion available seat miles (ASMs). American&#146;s passenger load factor
increased 2.1 points to 72.8&nbsp;percent and passenger revenue yield per passenger
mile increased by 0.4&nbsp;percent, or 0.05 cents, to 11.91 cents, driving
American&#146;s passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM)&nbsp;up by 3.3&nbsp;percent,
or 0.28 cents, to 8.67 cents. In 2003, American derived approximately 70
percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 30
percent from international operations. Following is additional information
regarding Americans domestic and international RASM and capacity:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s Regional Affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries,
American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR
Eagle), and two independent carriers with which American has capacity purchase
agreements, Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua Airlines,
Inc. (Chautauqua). In 2003, American had capacity purchase agreements with
Chautauqua and Trans States for the full year. In 2002, American had a
capacity purchase agreement with Chautauqua for the full year and a capacity
purchase agreement with Trans States beginning in November&nbsp;2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Regional Affiliates&#146; passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard
mileage proration agreements for flights connecting to American flights,
increased $88&nbsp;million, or 6.1&nbsp;percent, to $1.5&nbsp;billion as a result of increased
capacity and load factors. Regional Affiliates&#146; traffic increased 20.5
percent, or 940&nbsp;million revenue passenger miles (RPMs), to 5.5&nbsp;billion RPMs,
while capacity increased 18.6&nbsp;percent, or 1.3&nbsp;billion ASMs, to 8.6&nbsp;billion
ASMs. This is somewhat offset by the elimination, in 2003, of a fee, paid to
AMR Eagle by American, for passengers connecting to American flights.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cargo revenues remained relatively flat with a decrease of 0.5&nbsp;percent, or $3
million, to $558&nbsp;million.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Other revenues increased 4.4&nbsp;percent, or $43&nbsp;million, to $1.0&nbsp;billion due to
increases in (i)&nbsp;airfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges, (ii)
AAdvantage program fees, (iii)&nbsp;employee travel service charges, (iv)&nbsp;excess
baggage fees and (v)&nbsp;ticket change fees coupled with changes to the Company&#146;s
change fee arrangements with travel agencies. These increases were offset
somewhat by decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for
other airlines.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>2002 Compared to 2001 </I></B>Although traffic continued to increase on reduced
capacity following the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, the Company&#146;s 2002
revenues and yields were down materially year-over-year. In addition to the
residual effects of September&nbsp;11, the Company&#146;s revenues continued to be
negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel
declines and changes in business traveler profiles; the geographic distribution
of the Company&#146;s network; and reduced fares due in part to increased
competition from low-cost carriers. TWA LLC purchased substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of TWA on April&nbsp;9, 2001. The results of
operations of TWA LLC are included in the Company and American&#146;s results of
operations beginning on that date. The Company&#146;s revenues decreased
approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion, or 8.2&nbsp;percent, to $17.4&nbsp;billion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American&#146;s passenger revenues decreased by 8.5&nbsp;percent, or $1.3&nbsp;billion, to
$14.4&nbsp;billion. American&#146;s passenger load factor increased by 1.7 points to
70.7&nbsp;percent while passenger revenue yield per passenger mile decreased by 9.3
percent, or 1.22 cents, to 11.86 cents, driving American&#146;s RASM down by 7.2
percent, or 0.65 cents, to 8.39 cents. In 2002, American derived approximately
70&nbsp;percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately
30&nbsp;percent from international operations. Following is additional information
regarding Americans domestic and international RASM and capacity:

average hotel rates, work rule changes and lower per diems; (iii)

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Other income (expense)&nbsp;consists of interest income and expense, interest
capitalized and miscellaneous &#151; net.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>2003 Compared to 2002 </I></B>Other expense decreased $66&nbsp;million, or 12.5&nbsp;percent,
to $464&nbsp;million due primarily to the following: Interest income decreased $16
million, or 22.5&nbsp;percent, to $55&nbsp;million due primarily to decreases in interest
rates. Interest expense increased $18&nbsp;million, or 2.6&nbsp;percent, to $703&nbsp;million
resulting primarily from the approximately $903&nbsp;million increase in the
Company&#146;s long-term debt, offset by an $84&nbsp;million reduction in interest
expense related to the agreement reached with the IRS discussed below.
Interest capitalized decreased $15&nbsp;million, or 17.4&nbsp;percent, to $71&nbsp;million due
primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment.
Miscellaneous-net increased $115&nbsp;million to $113&nbsp;million, due primarily to an
$80&nbsp;million gain on the sale of the Company&#146;s investment in Hotwire and a $70
million gain related to an initial public offering by Orbitz, offset by the
write-down of certain investments held by the Company during the first quarter
of 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>2002 Compared to 2001 </I></B>Other expense increased $244&nbsp;million, or 85.3&nbsp;percent,
to $530&nbsp;million due primarily to the following: Interest income decreased $39
million, or 35.5&nbsp;percent, to $71&nbsp;million due primarily to decreases in interest
rates. Interest expense increased $147&nbsp;million, or 27.3&nbsp;percent, to $685
million resulting primarily from the increase in the Company&#146;s long-term debt
of approximately $2.7&nbsp;billion. Interest capitalized decreased $58&nbsp;million, or
40.3&nbsp;percent, to $86&nbsp;million due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits
for flight equipment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>INCOME TAX BENEFIT</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2003 </B>The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with its 2003
losses due to the Company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note
8 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, in 2003, the Company
reached an agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995. As a
result of this agreement, the Company recorded an $80&nbsp;million tax benefit to
reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84&nbsp;million reduction
in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to the
accrued income tax liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 </B>The effective tax rate for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 was impacted
by a $57&nbsp;million charge resulting from a provision in Congress&#146; economic
stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of NOLs. This change
allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than
two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover
its NOLs. The extended NOL carryback did however result in the displacement of
foreign tax credits taken in prior years. These credits are now expected to
expire before being utilized by the Company, resulting in this charge.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2003, the President signed the Act, which includes aviation-related
assistance provisions. The Act authorized payment of (i) $100&nbsp;million to
compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated with the strengthening
of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) $2.3&nbsp;billion to reimburse air carriers
for increased security costs, which was distributed in proportion to the
amounts each carrier had paid or collected in passenger security and air
carrier security fees to the Transportation Security Administration (the
Security Fee Reimbursement). The Company&#146;s Security Fee Reimbursement was $358
million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates) and was recorded
as a reduction to operating expenses. In addition, the Act suspended the
collection of the passenger security fee from June&nbsp;1, 2003 until September&nbsp;30,
2003 and authorized the extension of war-risk insurance through August&nbsp;31, 2004
(and permits further extensions until December&nbsp;31, 2004).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Outlook</U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Capacity for American&#146;s mainline jet operations is expected to increase about
six percent in 2004, despite removing aircraft from the fleet and reducing
mainline departures. This is due to increased efficiencies, driven by three
factors: (i)&nbsp;American operated with a low base number of flights in 2003 as a
result of the war in Iraq and SARS, (ii)&nbsp;American is adding seats back to its
Boeing 757 and Airbus A300 aircraft and (iii)&nbsp;as American realigns its
mid-continent hubs and de-peaks its Miami schedule, its aircraft productivity
levels will improve.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American&#146;s goal is to improve its unit costs by 17&nbsp;percent in the first quarter
of 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003, and by ten percent for the full
year, compared to 2003. American will have a full year of labor savings from
its Labor Agreements and Management Reductions and more fully realize the
savings from its other strategic cost savings initiatives. However, there are
significant cost challenges in 2004 that may affect its ability to achieve this
goal, primarily from medical benefits costs, airport fees and maintenance,
materials and repairs costs (due to flight hour agreement contractual rate
increases and the benefit from retiring aircraft subsiding). In addition, the
Company expects fuel prices to remain high during 2004. See &#147;Risk Factors&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Other Information</U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Environmental Matters </B>Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential
liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain
airport locations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential
liability is joint and several. AMR&#146;s alleged volumetric contributions at all
but one of these sites are minimal compared to others. AMR does not expect
these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material impact on its
results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additional information
is included in Part&nbsp;C of Item&nbsp;1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates </B>The preparation of the Company&#146;s
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. The Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable;
however, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could
differ from those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical
accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of the
Company&#146;s financial statements: accounting for long-lived assets, passenger
revenue, frequent flyer program, pensions and other postretirement benefits,
and income taxes.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Long-lived
assets</I> &#151; The Company has approximately $20&nbsp;billion of long-lived
assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, including approximately $19&nbsp;billion related
to flight equipment and other fixed assets. In addition to the original
cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of
policy elections made by the Company, including estimated useful lives and
salvage values. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets&#148; (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on long-lived
assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the
assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets
and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In
making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions,
including, but not limited to: (i)&nbsp;estimated fair value of the assets, and
(ii)&nbsp;estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets,
which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length
of service and estimated salvage values. A change in the Company&#146;s fleet
plan has been the primary indicator that has resulted in an impairment
charge. The Company recorded impairment charges related to its Fokker 100,
Saab 340 and ATR 42 aircraft in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, the Company
recorded an impairment charge related to its Airbus A300 aircraft as a
result of accelerating the planned retirement of this fleet. In addition,
in 2003, the Company recorded impairment charges related to its Boeing
767-200 aircraft and four of its Boeing 767-200ER aircraft as a result of
permanently retiring these aircraft. Also in 2003, the Company analyzed its
remaining Boeing 767-200ER aircraft and determined that these aircraft were
not impaired based on anticipated future cash flows. See Notes 1 and 2 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information with
respect to these impairment charges and each of the policies and
assumptions used by the Company which affect the recorded values of
long-lived assets.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Passenger revenue &#151; </I>Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a
component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is
recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various
factors, including the industry&#146;s pricing structure and interline
agreements throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in
revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue
recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized, including breakage.
These estimates are generally based upon the evaluation of historical
trends, including the use of regression analysis and other methods to model
the outcome of future events based on the Company&#146;s historical experience
and are generally recognized at the time of sale. The Company&#146;s estimation
techniques have been applied consistently from year to year. However, due
to changes in the Company&#146;s ticket refund policy and changes in the travel
profile of customers, historical trends may not be representative of future
results.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Frequent
flyer program</I> &#151; The Company uses a number of estimates in
accounting for its AAdvantage frequent flyer program. Additional
information regarding the Company&#146;s AAdvantage frequent flyer program is
included in Part&nbsp;F of Item&nbsp;1 of this Report. Changes to the percentage of
the amount of revenue deferred, deferred recognition period, percentage of
awards expected to be redeemed for travel on participating airlines, cost
per mile estimates or the minimum award level accrued could have a
significant impact on the Company&#146;s revenues or incremental cost accrual in
the year of the change as well as in future years.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Pensions and other postretirement benefits </I>&#151; The Company&#146;s pension and
other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using
various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. The Company uses certain
assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i)
discount rate, (ii)&nbsp;expected return on plan assets, and (iii)&nbsp;expected
health care cost trend rate.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s discount rate is determined based upon the review of high
quality corporate bond rates, the change in these rates during the year,
and year-end rate levels. Lowering the discount rate by 0.5&nbsp;percent as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003 would increase the Company&#146;s pension and postretirement
benefits liability by approximately $532&nbsp;million and $169&nbsp;million,
respectively, and increase estimated 2004 pension and postretirement
benefits expense by $66&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million, respectively.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of the
Company&#146;s historical trends and experience taking into account current and
expected market conditions. The expected return on plan assets component of
the Company&#146;s net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair
value of plan assets and the Company&#146;s target asset allocation of 40
percent longer duration corporate bonds, 25&nbsp;percent U.S. value stocks, 20
percent international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and
bonds and 10&nbsp;percent alternative (private)&nbsp;investments. The Company
monitors its actual asset allocation and believes that its long-term asset
allocation will continue to approximate its target allocation. The
Company&#146;s historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets,
calculated using a geometric compounding of monthly returns, is
approximately 10.5&nbsp;percent as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. Lowering the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5&nbsp;percent as of December&nbsp;31,
2003 would increase estimated 2004 pension expense by approximately $32
million.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of the
Company&#146;s historical trends and experience taking into account current and
expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend
rate by 1.0&nbsp;percent would increase estimated 2004 postretirement benefits
expense by $41&nbsp;million.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">The Company has pension and postretirement benefit unrecognized net
actuarial losses as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion and
$407&nbsp;million, respectively. The unrecognized net actuarial losses
represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation, the
postretirement accumulated benefit obligation and plan assets resulting
from (i)&nbsp;changes in assumptions and (ii)&nbsp;actual experience differing from
assumptions. The amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss component
of the Company&#146;s 2004 pension and postretirement benefit net periodic
benefit costs are expected to be approximately $58&nbsp;million and $8&nbsp;million,
respectively. The Company&#146;s total 2004 defined benefit pension expense and
postretirement expense is currently estimated to be approximately $428
million and $264&nbsp;million (including the impact of the Medicare legislation
discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements),
respectively.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">The Company records an additional minimum pension liability when its
accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the pension plans&#146; assets in excess
of amounts previously accrued for pension costs. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003,
the Company&#146;s additional minimum pension liability was $1.1&nbsp;billion, down
from $1.6&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, primarily as a result of
significantly improved asset performance. The decrease in the Company&#146;s
minimum pension liability resulted in a 2003 credit to equity of
approximately $337&nbsp;million. An additional minimum pension liability is
recorded as an increase to the pension liability, an increase to other
assets (to the extent that a plan has unrecognized prior service costs) and
a charge to stockholders&#146; equity as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information regarding the Company&#146;s pension and other
postretirement benefits.

the Company&#146;s potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of
applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional
exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues,
release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision
affecting a particular tax issue. In 2003, the Company reached an
agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995 and as a
result, recorded an $80&nbsp;million tax benefit to reduce previously accrued
income tax liabilities and an $84&nbsp;million reduction in interest expense to
reduce previously accrued interest related to accrued tax liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Risk Factors</U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s ability to return to sustained profitability will depend on a
number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond the Company&#146;s control.
Among other things, the following factors have had and/or may have a negative
impact on the Company&#146;s business and financial results:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Economic and Other Conditions </B>The airline industry is affected by changes in
international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial
conditions, inflation, war, terrorist attacks, political instability (or the
threat thereof), consumer preferences and spending patterns, demographic
trends, disruptions to the air traffic control system, consumer perceptions of
airline safety, costs of safety, security and environmental measures, and the
weather.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Substantial Indebtedness </B>The Company has, and will continue to have, a
significant amount of indebtedness. In addition, the Company, American and
their respective subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including
secured debt, in the future. As discussed earlier in this Report, the
Company&#146;s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For
example, it could (i)&nbsp;limit the Company&#146;s ability to obtain additional
financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general
corporate purposes, (ii)&nbsp;require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion
of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby
reducing the funds available for other purposes, (iii)&nbsp;make the Company more
vulnerable to economic downturns, (iv)&nbsp;limit its ability to withstand
competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions and, (v)&nbsp;limit the Company&#146;s flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which
it operates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Credit Facility Covenants </B>American has a fully drawn $834&nbsp;million bank credit
facility that expires December&nbsp;15, 2005, which contains a liquidity covenant
and an EBITDAR (generally, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain non-cash items) to fixed charges
(generally, interest and total rentals) ratio covenant. The Company expects to
be able to continue to comply with these covenants. However, it cannot be sure
that it will continue to be able to do so through the expiration of the
facility. Failure to do so would result in a default under this facility and a
significant amount of American&#146;s other debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Fuel Prices / Supply </B>Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry,
in the event of continuing increases in the price of jet fuel, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its
customers by increasing its fares. Likewise, increased fare competition and
lower revenues for all air carriers may offset any potential benefit of lower
fuel prices. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had hedged approximately 21
percent of its expected first quarter 2004 fuel requirements, and a much lower
percentage of its expected fuel requirements beyond March&nbsp;31, 2004.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">While the Company does not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel
availability, dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of
changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and
marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel.
In the event there is an outbreak of hostilities or other conflicts in oil
producing areas or elsewhere, there could be reductions in the production
and/or importation of crude oil and/or significant increases in the cost of
fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or
significant increases in its cost, or if current high prices are sustained for
a significant period of time, the Company&#146;s business, as well as that of the
entire industry, would be adversely affected.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition in the Airline Industry </B>Service over almost all of the Company&#146;s
routes is highly competitive and fares remain at historically low levels. The
Company faces vigorous competition from major domestic airlines, national,
regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, low-cost air
carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments, ground transportation.
Increasingly, the Company faces significant competition from
marketing/operational alliances formed by its competitors. To the extent those
alliances can undertake activities that are not available to the Company, the
Company&#146;s ability to effectively compete could be hindered. Pricing decisions
are affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting by
competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company&#146;s financial
results because the Company is generally required to match competitors&#146; fares
to maintain passenger traffic. No assurance can be given that any future fare
reduction would be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in
costs or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields. In addition,
since September&nbsp;11, 2001, several air carriers have recently reorganized or are
reorganizing under Chapter&nbsp;11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including
United and US Airways. It is possible that other competitors may seek to
reorganize in or out of Chapter&nbsp;11. Historically, air carriers involved in
reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to
maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Restructuring Program </B>As discussed in the Overview to this Item, the Company
is continuing to implement a restructuring program. The ability of the Company
to successfully implement the program without affecting operational performance
and service levels is not assured.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Changing Business Strategy </B>The Company evaluates its assets on an ongoing
basis with a view to maximizing their value to the Company and determining
which are core to its operations. It also evaluates its business strategies.
The Company may change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue
some of the goals stated herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Reduced Pricing Power </B>The Company has reduced pricing power, resulting mainly
from greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers, especially business
travelers, and increasing competition from low cost carriers. The percentage
of routes on which the Company competes with carriers having substantially
lower operating costs has grown significantly over the past decade. The
Company now competes with low cost carriers on most of its domestic network.
At the same time, the continuous increase in pricing transparency resulting
from the use of the Internet has enabled cost conscious customers to more
easily obtain the lowest fare on any given route.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Government Regulation </B>Future results of the Company&#146;s operations may vary
based upon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over
the Company&#146;s operations may take, including the granting and timing of certain
governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for
codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictions
on competitive practices (e.g., court orders, or agency regulations or
orders, that would curtail an airline&#146;s ability to respond to a competitor),
the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (e.g., new
passenger security standards), and the adoption of more restrictive
locally-imposed noise restrictions.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Military Involvement </B>Prior to the war in Iraq, the increased threat of U.S.
military involvement in overseas operations had a significant adverse impact on
the Company&#146;s business, financial position (including access to capital
markets) and results of operations and on the airline industry in general.
Furthermore, the war in Iraq had a significant adverse impact on international
and domestic revenues and future bookings. The continuing U.S. military
involvement in Iraq, or other conflicts in the Middle East or elsewhere, may
result in a similar adverse impact.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Terrorist Attacks </B>As described elsewhere in this Report, the events of
September&nbsp;11, 2001 had a material adverse impact on the Company. The
occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or international and
whether against the Company or another entity) would again have a material
adverse impact on the Company, its finances and/or its operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Uncertainty in International Operations </B>The Company&#146;s current international
activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as
reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,
currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international government
regulation of the Company&#146;s operations, including the inability to obtain or
retain needed route authorities and/or slots.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Diseases </B>In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), which primarily had an adverse impact on the Company&#146;s Pacific
operations. If there were another outbreak of a disease (such as SARS) that
affects travel behavior, it could have a material adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Uncertainty of Future Collective Bargaining Agreements and Events </B>The Company&#146;s
operations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reach
agreement with any labor union representing the Company&#146;s employees. In
addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outside the
confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact the
Company&#146;s operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Need for Additional Liquidity </B>The Company needs additional liquidity because
of its significant debt obligations maturing in the next several years, as well
as substantial, and increasing pension funding obligations. The Company&#146;s
ability to obtain future financing or to sell assets may also be adversely
affected because American has fewer unencumbered assets available than in years
past. In recent years, a large portion of the aircraft assets (including
virtually all of the aircraft eligible for benefits of Section&nbsp;1110 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code) have been encumbered. The ability to borrow against or sell
those assets on acceptable terms is uncertain and, in any event, those assets
may not maintain their current market value. To maintain sufficient liquidity
as the Company continues to implement the Turnaround Plan, the Company will
need continued access to additional funding. If the revenue environment
deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Company is unable to access
the capital markets, it may be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its
operations in the long-term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Credit Ratings </B>Since the September&nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks, AMR&#146;s and
American&#146;s credit ratings have been lowered significantly. These reductions
have increased borrowing costs and limited borrowing options. Additional
significant reductions in the credit ratings could further increase borrowing
or other costs and further restrict the availability of future financing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Insurance Costs </B>The Company carries insurance for public liability, passenger
liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. As
a result of the September&nbsp;11, 2001 events, aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of
insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to
persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of
terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these
insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in
general. The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk
insurance for U.S. based airlines until August&nbsp;31, 2004, covering losses to
employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. In addition, the Secretary
of Transportation may extend the policy until December&nbsp;31, 2004, at his
discretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the
U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company
will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial
insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at
commercially reasonable rates, the Company&#146;s results of operations would be
negatively affected. In addition, in the event commercial insurance carriers
further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the Company, or
significantly increase its cost, the Company&#146;s operations and/or financial
position and results of operations would be adversely affected.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ITEM 7(A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions </U></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The risk inherent in the Company&#146;s market risk sensitive instruments and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below.
The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such
adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider
additional actions management may take to mitigate the Company&#146;s exposure to
such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. See Note 7 to
the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional
information.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Aircraft Fuel </I></B>The Company&#146;s earnings are affected by changes in the price and
availability of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over
price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage
facilities to support its flight operations. The Company also manages the
price risk of fuel costs primarily by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude
oil swap and option contracts. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10
percent increase in the December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 cost per gallon of fuel.
Based on projected 2004 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an
increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $268&nbsp;million in 2004,
inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December&nbsp;31,
2003, and assumes the Company&#146;s fuel hedging program remains effective under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;. Comparatively, based on projected 2003
fuel usage, such an increase would have resulted in an increase to aircraft
fuel expense of approximately $205&nbsp;million in 2003, inclusive of the impact of
fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2002. The change in market
risk is due to the increase in fuel prices and a decrease in the amount of fuel
hedged. Beginning in March&nbsp;2003, because of the Company&#146;s then existing
financial condition, the Company stopped entering into new hedge contracts and,
in June&nbsp;2003, terminated substantially all of its contracts with maturities
beyond March&nbsp;2004. Commencing in October&nbsp;2003, the Company began to enter into
new fuel hedging contracts with maturities beyond March&nbsp;2004 for a portion of
its future fuel requirements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had
hedged, with option contracts, approximately 12&nbsp;percent of its estimated 2004
fuel requirements, or approximately 21&nbsp;percent of its estimated first quarter
2004 fuel requirements, 16&nbsp;percent of its second quarter 2004 estimated fuel
requirements and six percent of its estimated fuel requirements for the
remainder of 2004. Comparatively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 the Company had
hedged approximately 32&nbsp;percent of its estimated 2003 fuel requirements, 15
percent of its estimated 2004 fuel requirements, and approximately four percent
of its estimated 2005 fuel requirements. The Company&#146;s credit rating has
limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A
further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position may negatively
affect the Company&#146;s ability to hedge fuel in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Foreign Currency </I></B>The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange
rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated
operating revenues and expenses. The Company&#146;s largest exposure comes from the
British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American
currencies. Previously, the Company used options to hedge a portion of its
anticipated foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. After determining its
foreign currency hedge program&#146;s impact was no longer materially beneficial,
the Company discontinued entering into foreign currency hedges. The Company
plans to periodically evaluate its foreign currency exposure to determine
whether its foreign currency
hedge program should be reinstated. The result of a uniform 10&nbsp;percent
strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002
levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign
currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of
approximately $77&nbsp;million and $65&nbsp;million for the years ending December&nbsp;31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, due to the Company&#146;s foreign-denominated revenues
exceeding its foreign-denominated expenses. This sensitivity analysis was
prepared based upon projected 2004 and 2003 foreign currency-denominated
revenues and expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Interest </I></B>The Company&#146;s earnings are also affected by changes in interest
rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and
short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
instruments. The Company&#146;s largest exposure with respect to variable-rate debt
comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company
had variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 37&nbsp;percent and 43
percent of its total long-term debt at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and interest rate swaps on notional amounts of approximately $138
million at December&nbsp;31, 2002. If the Company&#146;s interest rates average 10
percent more in 2004 than they did at December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company&#146;s interest
expense would increase by approximately $13&nbsp;million and interest income from
cash and short-term investments would increase by approximately $4&nbsp;million. In
comparison, at December&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company estimated that if interest rates
averaged 10&nbsp;percent more in 2003 than they did at December&nbsp;31, 2002, the
Company&#146;s interest expense would have increased by approximately $15&nbsp;million
and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased
by approximately $5&nbsp;million. These amounts are determined by considering the
impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the Company&#146;s variable-rate
long-term debt, interest rate swap agreements, and cash and short-term
investment balances at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential
increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10&nbsp;percent decrease in
interest rates, and amounts to approximately $372&nbsp;million and $395&nbsp;million as
of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The change in market risk is due
primarily to the increase in the Company&#146;s fixed-rate long-term debt during
2003. The fair values of the Company&#146;s long-term debt were estimated using
quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company&#146;s
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Other </I></B>The Company holds investments in certain other entities which are subject
to market risk. However, the impact of such market risk on earnings is not
significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and the
geographically diverse nature of these holdings.

an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a

<HR size="1" noshade width="100%" align="center">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1. Summary of Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Basis of Presentation </B>The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary American Airlines, Inc.
(American). On April&nbsp;9, 2001, American (through a wholly owned subsidiary, TWA
Airlines LLC (TWA LLC)) purchased substantially all of the assets of Trans
World Airlines, Inc. (TWA)&nbsp;and assumed certain liabilities. TWA was the eighth
largest U.S. carrier, with a primary domestic hub in St. Louis. American
funded the acquisition of TWA&#146;s assets with its existing cash and short-term
investments. The acquisition of TWA was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC since
the date of acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2003
presentation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Use of Estimates </B>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments </B>The Company has restricted cash
and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support
projected workers&#146; compensation obligations and various other obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Inventories </B>Spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment
are carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when used in
operations. Allowances for obsolescence are provided &#151; over the estimated
useful life of the related aircraft and engines &#151; for spare parts expected to
be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service. Allowances are also
provided for spare parts currently identified as excess. These allowances are
based on management estimates, which are subject to change.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Maintenance and Repair Costs </B>Maintenance and repair costs for owned and
leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except
costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance
contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Intangible Assets </B>Route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate
lease rights represent the purchase price attributable to route authorities
(including international airport take-off and landing slots), domestic airport
take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets (route acquisition costs) are tested for
impairment annually on December&nbsp;31, rather than amortized, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets&#148; (SFAS 142). Airport operating and gate lease rights are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25&nbsp;years to a zero residual
value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Statements of Cash Flows </B>Short-term investments, without regard to remaining
maturity at acquisition, are not considered as cash equivalents for purposes of
the statements of cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Employee Accruals </B>The Company estimates the amount of potential retroactive
pay expected to be provided upon finalization of a labor agreement for work
groups working under contracts that have become amendable. These estimates are
based upon management&#146;s expectation of the most likely outcome of the contract
negotiations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Measurement of Asset Impairments </B>In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets&#148; (SFAS 144), the Company records impairment charges on
long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate
that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and
the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making
these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not
limited to: (i)&nbsp;estimated fair value of the assets, and (ii)&nbsp;estimated future
cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on
additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset
will be used in the Company&#146;s operations and estimated salvage values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Regional Affiliates </B>Revenue from ticket sales is generally recognized when
service is provided. Regional Affiliates revenues for flights connecting to
American flights are allocated based on industry standard mileage proration
agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Passenger Revenue </B>Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a
component of Air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is
recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various factors,
including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the
industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding
both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to
be recognized, including breakage. These estimates are generally based upon the
evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression analysis and
other methods to model the outcome of future events based on the Company&#146;s
historical experience, and are generally recorded at the time of sale.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1. Summary of Accounting Policies (Continued)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Frequent Flyer Program </B>The estimated incremental cost of providing free
travel awards is accrued when such award levels are reached. American sells
mileage credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent
flyer program. The portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage
credits, representing the revenue for air transportation sold, is valued at
current market rates and is deferred and amortized over 28&nbsp;months, which
approximates the expected period over which the mileage credits are used. The
remaining portion of the revenue, representing the marketing products sold and
administrative costs associated with operating the AAdvantage program, is
recognized upon sale, as the related services have been provided.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Tax Contingencies </B>The Company has reserves for taxes and associated interest
that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax
authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on
previously filed tax returns are appropriate, it nevertheless has established
tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may
challenge the positions taken by the Company resulting in additional
liabilities for taxes and interest. The tax reserves are reviewed as
circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the Company&#146;s
potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable
statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on
current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative
guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Advertising Costs </B>The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense was $150&nbsp;million, $161&nbsp;million and $202&nbsp;million for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Stock Options </B>The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees&#148; (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Under APB 25,
no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the exercise
price of the Company&#146;s stock option grants is at or above the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company has adopted the pro
forma disclosure features of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#148; (SFAS 123), as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;148, &#147;Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure&#148;. As required by SFAS 123,
pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share have been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and
awards granted using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. The fair
value for the stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001: risk-free interest rates ranging from
2.93% to 4.58%; dividend yields of 0%; expected stock volatility ranging from
45% to 55%; and expected life of the options ranging from 3.6&nbsp;years to 4.5
years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share
amounts if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation (in millions, except per share
amounts):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In early 2001, the economic slowdown in the U.S. resulted in a sharp decline in
the Company&#146;s revenues. This slowdown was accelerated and exacerbated by the
terrorist attacks on September&nbsp;11, 2001. As a result, the Company reduced its
operating schedule by approximately 20&nbsp;percent and reduced its workforce by
approximately 20,000 jobs in the fourth quarter 2001. Subsequent to these
events, the Company determined that the revenue decrease would likely persist
indefinitely and that achieving $4&nbsp;billion in annual capacity-independent cost
savings was necessary to offset the revenue decline. The Company initiated the
following restructuring activities to realize this goal:

    <TD>In 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its
costs by $2&nbsp;billion. These initiatives are being implemented through
2005, and involve: (i)&nbsp;scheduling efficiencies, including the
de-peaking of certain of its hubs, (ii)&nbsp;fleet simplification, (iii)
streamlined customer interaction, (iv)&nbsp;distribution modifications, (v)
in-flight product changes, (vi)&nbsp;operational changes and (vii)
headquarters/administration efficiencies. As a result of the
initiatives, the Company reduced an estimated 7,000 jobs by March
2003.</TD>

    <TD>In February&nbsp;2003, American asked its employees for approximately $1.8
billion in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages,
benefits and work rules. In April&nbsp;2003, American reached agreements
with its three unions (the Labor Agreements) and also implemented
various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-unionized
personnel, including officers and other management (the Management
Reductions), which resulted in additional workforce reductions. In
addition, the Company and American reached concessionary agreements
with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers (collectively,
the Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements). Generally,
under the terms of these Vendor Agreements, the Company or American
will receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods
and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect
to certain of its aircraft.</TD>

management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows using models

outside third party appraisals and recent transactions involving

the fact that with this grounding, no major airline will operate this

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As part of the Vendor Agreements discussed above, American sold 33 Fokker 100
aircraft (with a minimal net book value), issued a $23&nbsp;million
non-interest-bearing note, payable in installments and maturing in December
2010, entered into short-term leases on these aircraft and issued shares of AMR
common stock as discussed in Note 9. In exchange, approximately $130&nbsp;million of
debt related to certain of the Fokker 100 aircraft was retired. However, the
agreement contains provisions that would require American to repay additional
amounts of the original debt if certain events occur prior to December&nbsp;31,
2005, including: (i)&nbsp;an event of default (which generally occurs only if a
payment default occurs), (ii)&nbsp;an event of loss with respect to the related
aircraft, (iii)&nbsp;rejection by the Company of the lease under the provisions of
Chapter&nbsp;11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s filing for
bankruptcy under Chapter&nbsp;7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of this
transaction, including the sale of the 33 Fokker 100 aircraft, and the
termination of the Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements related to the debt
that has been retired, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $68
million. If the certain events described above do not occur, the Company
expects to recognize an additional gain of approximately $37&nbsp;million in
December&nbsp;2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><u>U.S. government grant</u></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2003, the President signed the Emergency Wartime Supplemental
Appropriations Act, 2003 (the Appropriations Act), which includes provisions
authorizing payment of $2.3&nbsp;billion to reimburse air carriers for increased
security costs in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid or collected
in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the Transportation
Security Administration (the Security Fee Reimbursement). The Company&#146;s
Security Fee Reimbursement was $358&nbsp;million (net of payments to independent
regional affiliates) and is included in U.S. government grant in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Appropriations Act also
limits the total cash compensation for the two most highly compensated named
executive officers in 2002 for certain airlines, including the Company, during
the period April&nbsp;1, 2003 to April&nbsp;1, 2004 to the amount of salary received by
such officers, or their successors, in 2002. A violation of this executive
compensation provision would require the carrier to repay the government its
Security Fee Reimbursement. The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in
complying with this limitation on executive compensation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On September&nbsp;22, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Stabilization Act). The Company
received a total of $866&nbsp;million from the U.S. government under the airline
compensation provisions of the Stabilization Act. For the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized approximately $10&nbsp;million and $856
million, respectively, which is included in U.S. government grant on the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, the Stabilization Act provides for compensation to individual
claimants who were physically injured or killed as a result of the terrorist
attacks of September&nbsp;11, 2001. Furthermore, the Stabilization Act provides
that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, liability for all claims,
whether compensatory or punitive, arising from the terrorist-related events of
September&nbsp;11, 2001 against any air carrier shall not exceed the liability
coverage maintained by the air carrier. Based upon estimates provided by the
Company&#146;s insurance providers, the Company recorded a liability of
approximately $2.3&nbsp;billion for claims arising from the events of September&nbsp;11,
2001, after considering the liability protections provided for by the
Stabilization Act. The Company has also recorded a liability of approximately
$637&nbsp;million related to flight 587, which crashed on November&nbsp;12, 2001. In
addition, the Company has recorded a receivable for these amounts, which the
Company expects to recover from its insurance carriers as claims are resolved.
These insurance receivables and liabilities are classified as Other assets and
Other liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets, respectively, and are based on reserves established by the Company&#146;s
insurance carriers. These estimates may be revised as additional information
becomes available concerning the expected claims. One of the Company&#146;s
insurance carriers has entered liquidation. The carrier provides approximately
five percent of the Company&#146;s coverage related to the events of September&nbsp;11,
2001 and flight 587, as well as other covered items. This results in
approximately $100&nbsp;million in receivables, net of reserves, from the insurance
carrier as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Company expects to recover the net
receivable via the liquidation process or other means available.

interest in Worldspan. It received $84&nbsp;million in cash, $80&nbsp;million of which
was recognized as a gain, for its interest in Hotwire. In addition, during
2003, the Company sold a portion of its interest in Orbitz, a travel planning
website, in connection with an Orbitz initial public offering and a secondary

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has contracts related to facility construction or improvement
projects, primarily at airport locations. The contractual obligations related
to these projects totaled approximately $600&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.
The Company expects to make payments related to these projects as follows: $250
million in 2004, $188&nbsp;million in 2005, $93&nbsp;million in 2006 and $69&nbsp;million in
2007. In addition, the Company has an information technology support related
contract that requires minimum annual payments of $158&nbsp;million through 2013.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has capacity purchase agreements with two regional airlines,
Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Trans States Airlines, Inc.
(collectively the American Connection carriers) to provide Embraer EMB-140/145
regional jet services to certain markets under the brand &#147;American
Connection&#148;. Under these arrangements, the Company pays the American
Connection carriers a fixed fee per block hour to operate the aircraft. The
block hour fees are designed to cover the American Connection carriers&#146; fully
allocated costs. Assumptions for highly volatile or uncontrollable costs such
as fuel, landing fees, insurance, and aircraft ownership are trued up to
actual values on a pass through basis. In addition to covering the cost of
operations, the Company also pays a designed profit margin to the American
Connection carriers. In consideration for these payments, the Company retains
all passenger and other revenues resulting from the operation of the American
Connection regional jets. Minimum payments under the contracts are $95
million in 2004, $69&nbsp;million in 2005, $70&nbsp;million in 2006, $71&nbsp;million in 2007
and $20&nbsp;million in 2008. However, based on expected utilization, the Company
expects to make payments of $162&nbsp;million in 2004, $164&nbsp;million in 2005, $166
million in 2006, $168&nbsp;million in 2007, $170&nbsp;million in 2008 and $854&nbsp;million
in 2009 and beyond. In addition, if the Company terminates the Chautauqua
contract without cause, Chautauqua has the right to put its Embraer aircraft
to the Company. If this were to happen, the Company would take possession of
the aircraft and become liable for lease obligations totaling approximately
$21&nbsp;million per year with lease expirations in 2018 and 2019.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general
indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various
risks. The Company is not able to estimate the potential amount of any
liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in
the following paragraphs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s loan agreements and other London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR)-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft
leases) generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender for
incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (i)&nbsp;any reserve
or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with, or credit
extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii)&nbsp;any tax, duty, or other
charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii)&nbsp;capital
adequacy requirements. In addition, the Company&#146;s loan agreements, derivative
contracts and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax
provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to the applicable
lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on
such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable
tax law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire
term of the applicable transaction, and there is no limitation on the maximum
additional amounts the Company could be obligated to pay under such provisions.
Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger
an event of default, and, in a secured financing transaction, would entitle the
lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans
and derivative transactions, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have
rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law,
illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, the
Company may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant
transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In its aircraft financing agreements, the Company generally indemnifies the
financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties
against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing,
manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft
regardless of whether these liabilities (or taxes) relate to the negligence of
the indemnified parties.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>4. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (Continued)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real
estate leases where the Company as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related
parties) against liabilities related to the Company&#146;s use of the leased
property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from
the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In
addition, the Company provides environmental indemnities in many of these
leases for contamination related to the Company&#146;s use of the leased property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under certain contracts with third parties, the Company indemnifies the third
party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third party, or
certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential
exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. Generally, the Company
has liability insurance protecting the Company for its obligations it has
undertaken under these indemnities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AMR and American have event risk covenants in approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion of
indebtedness and operating leases as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. These covenants
permit the holders of such obligations to receive a higher rate of return
(between 100 and 650 basis points above the stated rate) if a designated event,
as defined, should occur and the credit ratings of such obligations are
downgraded below certain levels within a certain period of time. No designated
event, as defined, has occurred as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is subject to environmental issues at various other airport and
non-airport locations for which it has accrued $72&nbsp;million and $92&nbsp;million,
which are included in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Management
believes, after considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition
of these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on the Company&#146;s current
assessments of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or
decrease as these assessments change.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its
operations. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from
these claims and litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>5. Leases</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As discussed in Note 2, in 2003, the Company reached concessionary agreements
with certain lessors. The Vendor Agreements with these lessors affected the
payments, lease term, and other conditions of certain leases. As a result of
these changes, 30 leases, which were previously accounted for as operating
leases, were converted to capital leases, and one lease, which was previously
accounted for as a capital lease, was converted to an operating lease. The
Company recorded the new capital leases at the fair value of the respective
assets being leased. These changes did not have a significant effect on the
Company&#146;s accompanying consolidated balance sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, certain of the Vendor Agreements provide that the Company&#146;s
obligations under the related lease revert to the original terms if certain
events occur prior to December&nbsp;31, 2005, including: (i)&nbsp;an event of default
under the related lease (which generally occurs only if a payment default
occurs), (ii)&nbsp;an event of loss with respect to the related aircraft, (iii)
rejection by the Company of the lease under the provisions of Chapter&nbsp;11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s filing for bankruptcy under Chapter
7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If any one of these events were to occur, the
Company would be responsible for approximately $24&nbsp;million in additional
operating lease payments and $11&nbsp;million in additional payments related to
capital leases as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. This amount will increase to
approximately $119&nbsp;million in operating lease payments and $111&nbsp;million in
payments related to capital leases prior to the expiration of the provision on
December&nbsp;31, 2005. These amounts are being accounted for as contingent rentals
and will only be recognized if they become payable.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had 259 jet aircraft and 27 turboprop
aircraft under operating leases and 99 jet aircraft and 13 turboprop aircraft
under capital leases. The aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates
based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for one to five years.
Some aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term
at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the
defined lessor&#146;s cost of the aircraft or a predetermined fixed amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities
primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased
by American and accounted for as operating leases. Approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion
of these bonds (with total future payments of approximately $4.8&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003) are guaranteed by American, AMR, or both. Approximately $532
million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender
provisions that require American to make operating lease payments sufficient to
repurchase the bonds at various times: $112&nbsp;million in 2004, $104&nbsp;million in
2005, $28&nbsp;million in 2006, $100&nbsp;million in 2007 and $188&nbsp;million in 2008.
Although American has the right to remarket the bonds, there can be no
assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to
redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally reduce
existing rent leveling accruals or be considered prepaid facility rentals and
would reduce future operating lease commitments. The special facility revenue
bonds that contain mandatory tender provisions are included in the table above
at their ultimate maturity date rather than their mandatory tender provision
date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.4&nbsp;billion, $1.6&nbsp;billion and $1.7
billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, &#147;Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities&#148;, revised in December&nbsp;2003, (Interpretation 46),
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE)&nbsp;to include
the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the VIE in its
consolidated financial statements, as well as disclosure of information about
the assets and liabilities, and the nature, purpose and activities of
consolidated variable interest entities. In addition, Interpretation 46
requires disclosure of information about the nature, purpose and activities of
an unconsolidated VIE in which the Company holds a significant variable
interest. The provisions of Interpretation 46 were effective immediately for
any interest in a VIE acquired after January&nbsp;31, 2003 and beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2003 for any interest in a VIE commonly referred to as
special-purpose entity that was acquired before February&nbsp;1, 2003. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board deferred the effective date of Interpretation 46 to
the first quarter of 2004 for any other interests in a VIE acquired before
February&nbsp;1, 2003. Certain entities, including entities established by
municipalities for the purpose of issuing special facility revenue bonds, are
not subject to the provisions of Interpretation 46. In addition, certain
entities with which the Company has capacity purchase agreements are not
considered VIEs, as they are considered businesses as defined by Interpretation
46.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has completed its evaluation of its interests in VIEs, including
certain aircraft operating leases with fixed price purchase options and certain
fuel consortia arrangements. The Company has determined that it holds a
significant variable interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary of,
certain trusts that are the lessor under certain of its aircraft operating
leases (discussed below). Furthermore, the Company has determined that it is
neither the primary beneficiary of, nor holds a significant variable interest
in, any of its various fuel consortia arrangements. As a result,
Interpretation 46 has had no impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated statement of
operations or balance sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American has 88 aircraft operating leases where the lessor is a variable
interest entity &#151; a trust &#151; and the lease contains a fixed price purchase
option, which allows American to purchase the aircraft at a predetermined price
on a specified date. However, American does not guarantee the residual value
of the aircraft. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, future lease payments required under
these leases totaled $3.2&nbsp;billion.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American has a fully drawn $834&nbsp;million bank credit facility that expires
December&nbsp;15, 2005, which contains a liquidity covenant and an EBITDAR
(generally, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
rentals, adjusted for certain non-cash items) to fixed charges (generally,
interest and total rentals) ratio covenant. The required EBITDAR to fixed
charges ratio is 1.1 to 1.0 for the three-month period ending March&nbsp;31, 2004,
and increases on a quarterly basis up to 1.5 to 1.0 for each four consecutive
quarters ending after December&nbsp;31, 2004. The liquidity covenant requires
American to maintain a minimum level of $1.0&nbsp;billion of unrestricted cash and
short-term investments. The Company expects to be able to continue to comply
with these covenants. However, it cannot be sure that it will continue to be
able to do so through the expiration of the facility. Failure to do so would
result in a default under this facility and a significant amount of American&#146;s
other debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, American borrowed approximately $554
million, under seller financed debt agreements, related to the purchase of
aircraft. These debt agreements are secured by the related aircraft and have
effective interest rates, which are fixed and mature over various periods of
time through 2013. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the effective interest rate on
these agreements ranged up to 9.12&nbsp;percent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $473
million, under various debt agreements, related to the purchase of regional jet
aircraft, including certain seller financed agreements. These debt agreements
are secured by the related aircraft and have effective interest rates, which
are fixed or variable based on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various
periods of time through 2020. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the effective interest
rate on these agreements ranged up to 6.73&nbsp;percent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, in July&nbsp;2003, American issued $255&nbsp;million of enhanced equipment
trust certificates, secured by aircraft, which bear interest at 3.86&nbsp;percent
and are repayable in semi-annual installments beginning in 2004, with a final
maturity in 2010. These obligations are partially insured by a third party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2003, the Company issued $300&nbsp;million principal amount of its 4.25
percent senior convertible notes due 2023 in a private placement. Each note is
convertible into AMR common stock at a conversion rate of 57.61 shares per
$1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an equivalent conversion
price of $17.36 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The
notes are convertible under certain circumstances, including if (i)&nbsp;the closing
sale price of the Company&#146;s common stock reaches a certain level for a
specified period of time, (ii)&nbsp;the trading price of the notes as a percentage
of the closing sale price of the Company&#146;s common stock falls below a certain
level for a specified period of time, (iii)&nbsp;the Company calls the notes for
redemption, or (iv)&nbsp;certain corporate transactions occur. Holders of the notes
may require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the notes on
September&nbsp;23, 2008, 2013 and 2018 at a purchase price equal to the principal
amount of the notes being purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of purchase. The Company may pay the purchase price in cash, common stock
or a combination of cash and common stock. After September&nbsp;23, 2008, the
Company may redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash at a price equal to
the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest as of the redemption date. These notes are guaranteed by American.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Also in September&nbsp;2003, American transferred its two headquarters buildings
located in Fort Worth, Texas to AA Real Estate Holding L.P., a wholly owned
consolidated subsidiary of American. This entity leased the buildings back to
American pursuant to a triple-net lease, and used the buildings and the lease
as security for a loan consisting of four notes, in the amount of $98&nbsp;million
(net of discount of $2&nbsp;million), which is reflected as debt in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet of the Company. Each note corresponds to a separate
class of AA/Ft. Worth HQ Finance Trust Lease Revenue Commercial Mortgage-Backed
Pass-Through Certificates, Series&nbsp;2003 (the Certificates) issued by the AA/Ft.
Worth HQ Finance Trust, which is not a subsidiary of American, in a private
placement pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The
Certificates and corresponding notes have an average effective interest rate of
7.2&nbsp;percent and a final maturity in 2010.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2002, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation and the New York City
Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the
Los Angeles International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport,
respectively, to provide reimbursement to American for certain facility
construction and other related costs. The Company has recorded the total
amount of the issuances of $759&nbsp;million (net of $38&nbsp;million discount) as
long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2002. These obligations bear interest at fixed rates, with an average
effective rate of 8.54&nbsp;percent, and mature over various periods of time, with
a final maturity in 2028. The Company has received approximately $687&nbsp;million
in reimbursements of certain facility construction and other related costs
through December&nbsp;31, 2003. Of the remaining $72&nbsp;million of bond issuance
proceeds not yet received, classified as Other assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet, $25&nbsp;million are held by the trustee for
reimbursement of future facility construction costs and will be available to
the Company in the future, and $47&nbsp;million are held in a debt service reserve
fund.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets having
a net book value of approximately $12.6&nbsp;billion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, AMR has issued guarantees covering approximately $932
million of American&#146;s tax-exempt bond debt and American has issued guarantees
covering approximately $936&nbsp;million of AMR&#146;s unsecured debt, including the 4.25
percent senior convertible notes discussed above. In addition, as of December
31, 2003, AMR and American have issued guarantees covering approximately $503
million of AMR Eagle&#146;s secured debt, and AMR has issued guarantees covering an
additional $1.9&nbsp;billion of AMR Eagle&#146;s secured debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $661&nbsp;million,
$564&nbsp;million and $343&nbsp;million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2004, American issued $180&nbsp;million of Fixed Rate Secured Notes due
2009. These notes are secured by certain spare parts and bear interest at 7.25
percent. Also in February&nbsp;2004, AMR issued, and American guaranteed, $324
million of 4.5&nbsp;percent senior convertible notes due 2024.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As part of the Company&#146;s risk management program, AMR uses a variety of
financial instruments, including fuel swap and option contracts and interest
rate swaps. Prior to September&nbsp;2002, the Company also used currency option
contracts and exchange agreements. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to these financial instruments, but it does not expect any of
the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. The credit exposure
related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of
contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the
effects of master netting agreements. To manage credit risks, the Company
selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the
program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The Company
also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its
counterparties which may require the Company or the counterparty to post
collateral if the value of selected instruments exceed specified mark-to-market
thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings. The Company&#146;s outstanding
posted collateral as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 is included in restricted cash and
short-term investments and is not material. The Company&#146;s credit rating has
limited its ability to enter into certain types of fuel hedge contracts. A
further deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position may negatively
affect the Company&#146;s ability to hedge fuel in the future.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">American enters into jet fuel, heating oil and crude oil swap and option
contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility in jet fuel prices. These
instruments generally have maturities of up to 24&nbsp;months. The Company accounts
for its fuel swap and option contracts as cash flow hedges and records the fair
value of its fuel hedging contracts in Other current assets, Other assets and
Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The Company determines the ineffective portion of its fuel hedge
contracts by comparing the cumulative change in the total value of the fuel
hedge contract, or group of fuel hedge contracts, to the cumulative change in
the forecasted value of the jet fuel being hedged. If the total cumulative
change in value of the fuel hedge contract more than offsets the total
cumulative change in the forecasted value of the jet fuel being hedged, the
difference is considered ineffective and is immediately recognized as a
component of Aircraft fuel expense. Effective gains or losses on fuel hedging
contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are
recognized in earnings as a component of Aircraft fuel expense when the
underlying jet fuel being hedged is used.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company monitors the commodities used in its fuel hedging programs to
determine that these commodities are expected to be &#147;highly effective&#148; in
offsetting changes in its forecasted jet fuel prices. In doing so, the Company
uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the percentage change
in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (i.e., WTI Crude oil and
NYMEX Heating oil) to the percentage change in prices of jet fuel over a 12 to
24&nbsp;month period. The fuel hedge contracts are deemed to be &#147;highly effective&#148;
if this correlation is within 80&nbsp;percent to 125&nbsp;percent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Beginning in March&nbsp;2003, because of the Company&#146;s then existing financial
condition, the Company stopped entering into new hedge contracts and, in June
2003, terminated substantially all of its contracts with maturities beyond
March&nbsp;2004. The termination of these contracts resulted in the collection of
approximately $41&nbsp;million in settlement of the contracts. The gain on these
contracts will continue to be deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss
and recognized in earnings when the original underlying jet fuel hedged is
used. Commencing in October&nbsp;2003, the Company began to enter into new option
contracts with maturities beyond March&nbsp;2004 for a portion of its future fuel
requirements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized
net gains of approximately $149&nbsp;million, $4&nbsp;million and $29&nbsp;million,
respectively, as a component of fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations related to its fuel hedging agreements. The net gains
recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 included approximately $1&nbsp;million, $13
million and $72&nbsp;million, respectively, of expense related to ineffectiveness.
The fair value of the Company&#146;s fuel hedging agreements at December&nbsp;31, 2003
and 2002, representing the amount the Company would receive to terminate the
agreements, totaled $54&nbsp;million and $212&nbsp;million, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has entered into Japanese yen currency exchange agreements to hedge
certain yen-based capital lease obligations (effectively converting these
obligations into dollar-based obligations). The Company accounts for its
Japanese yen currency exchange agreements as cash flow hedges whereby the fair
value of the related Japanese yen currency exchange agreements is reflected in
Other liabilities and deferred credits and Accumulated other comprehensive loss
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company has no
ineffectiveness with regard to its Japanese yen currency exchange agreements.
The fair values of the Company&#146;s yen currency exchange agreements, representing
the amount the Company would pay to terminate the agreements, were $33&nbsp;million
and $44&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The exchange

Company&#146;s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company&#146;s
long-term debt, including current maturities, were (in millions):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The deferred tax assets not
benefited in 2003 relate primarily to net operating loss
carryforwards. The deferred tax assets not benefited in 2002 related to the Company&#146;s uncertainty
regarding the realization of the foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net
operating losses, and in 2001 related to the
Company&#146;s uncertainty regarding the realization of the foreign tax credit
carryforwards.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the recording of other comprehensive
income items, primarily the minimum pension liability, resulted in a decrease
to the net deferred tax asset. The Company recorded a $111&nbsp;million reduction to
the valuation allowance as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income related to such net deferred tax asset. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, the
recording of other comprehensive income items, primarily the minimum pension
liability, resulted in a net deferred tax asset. The Company recorded a $313
million valuation allowance as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income related to such net deferred tax asset. The total change in
the valuation allowance was $293&nbsp;million and $363&nbsp;million
in 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will
not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or
all of the deferred tax assets, will be realized. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
(including reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which
those temporary differences will become deductible.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had available for federal income tax purposes
an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $427&nbsp;million,
which is available for an indefinite period, and federal net operating losses
of approximately $2.9&nbsp;billion for regular tax purposes, which will fully
expire, if unused, in 2022 and 2023. The Company had available for state income
tax purposes net operating losses of $2.9&nbsp;billion, which expire, if unused, in
years 2005 through 2023.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cash refunds for income taxes were $575&nbsp;million, $646&nbsp;million and $28&nbsp;million
for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The amounts received in 2003 and 2002
relate primarily to net operating loss carryback claims, including a carryback
claim filed as a result of a provision in Congress&#146; economic stimulus package
that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs). This
change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years,
rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more
quickly recover its NOLs.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance of
additional shares of AMR common stock to employees and Vendors in connection
with negotiations concerning concessions. The maximum number of shares
authorized for issuance was 30&nbsp;percent of the number of shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock outstanding on March&nbsp;24, 2003 (156,359,955) or approximately 46.9
million shares. From the foregoing authorization, the Company issued
approximately 2.5&nbsp;million shares to Vendors from treasury stock, resulting in a
re-allocation from Treasury stock to Additional paid-in capital of $142
million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2003, the Company established the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the
2003 Plan) to provide equity awards to employees in connection with the Labor
Agreements and Management Reductions discussed in Note 2. Under the 2003 Plan,
employees may be granted stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock.
The total number of shares authorized for distribution under the 2003 Plan is
42,680,000 shares.

Long Term Incentive Plan is 23,700,000 shares. The 1998 Long Term Incentive
Plan, the successor to the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, will terminate no
later than May&nbsp;21, 2008.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>10. Retirement Benefits</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">All regular employees of the Company are eligible to participate in pension
plans. The defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating employees
based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of
time before retirement. The Company uses a December&nbsp;31 measurement date for all
of its defined benefit plans. Airline pilots also participate in a defined
contribution plan for which Company contributions are determined as a
percentage of participant compensation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2001, American established a defined contribution plan for
non-contract employees in which the Company will match the employees before-tax
contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to 5.5&nbsp;percent of their
pensionable pay. During 2000, American provided a one-time election for
current non-contract employees to remain in the defined benefit plan or
discontinue accruing future credited service in the defined benefit plan as of
January&nbsp;1, 2001 and begin participation in the defined contribution plan.
Effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, all new non-contract employees of the Company become
members of the defined contribution plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including
certain health care and life insurance benefits (which provide secondary
coverage to Medicare), are provided to retired employees. The amount of health
care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as outlined in the plan.
Substantially all regular employees of American and employees of certain other
subsidiaries may become eligible for these benefits if they satisfy eligibility
requirements during their working lives.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of their
retiree health care benefits during their working lives. AMR funds benefits as
incurred and makes contributions to match employee prefunding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the acquisition of TWA in April&nbsp;2001, the Company assumed
certain retiree benefit plan liabilities of TWA, primarily its postretirement
benefit obligation. As such, the following information reflects the inclusion
of these obligations from the date of acquisition. In addition, effective
January&nbsp;1, 2002, TWA LLC employees were eligible to begin participation in
American&#146;s pension plans. However, these employees were not granted prior
credited service.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2003, as a result of the Labor Agreements and
Management Reductions discussed in Note 2, the Company remeasured its defined
benefit pension plans. The significant actuarial assumptions used for the
remeasurement were the same as those used as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, except for
the discount rate and salary scale, which were lowered to 6.50&nbsp;percent, and
2.78&nbsp;percent through 2008 and 3.78&nbsp;percent thereafter, respectively. In
addition, assumptions with respect to interest rates used to discount lump sum
benefit payments available under certain plans were updated. As a result of
workforce reductions related to the Labor Agreements and Management Reductions,
the Company recognized a curtailment loss of $46&nbsp;million related to its defined
benefit pension plans, which is included in Special charges in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. Net periodic benefit cost for defined
benefit pension plans includes eight months of expense calculated based upon
the revised measurement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2003, the President signed the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Modernization Act), which
introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, into law. In January
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;issued a FASB Staff
Position which permits companies to elect to defer accounting for the effects
of the Modernization Act. The Company has not elected this deferral and has
recognized the effect of the Modernization Act in the calculation of its
postretirement benefit liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. The effect of the
Modernization Act was to reduce the Company&#146;s accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO)&nbsp;by $415&nbsp;million by decreasing unrecognized net
actuarial losses. This decrease is due to a reduction in the expected per
capita claims cost along with a reduction in the expected rates of
participation in the plan. The decrease in the APBO will be reflected in the
Company&#146;s postretirement benefits expense in future periods through
amortization of unrecognized gains/losses. Additionally, the service and
interest cost components of postretirement benefits expense will be reduced in
future periods. Final authoritative guidance on accounting for the
Modernization Act has not been issued and could require the Company to change
previously reported information.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company estimates the long-term rate of return on plan assets will be nine
percent, based on the target asset allocation as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.
Expected returns on longer duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of
the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a
combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets
achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and
expected value to be generated through active management, currency overlay and
securities lending programs. The Company&#146;s annualized ten-year rate of return
on plan assets, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, is approximately 10.5&nbsp;percent.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s target asset allocation is 40&nbsp;percent longer duration corporate
and U.S. government/agency bonds, 25&nbsp;percent U.S. stocks, 20&nbsp;percent developed
international stocks, five percent emerging markets stocks and bonds, and ten
percent alternative (private)&nbsp;investments. Each asset class is actively managed
and has produced returns in excess of the expected rate over the last ten
years, net of management fees. Stocks and emerging market bonds are used to
provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the
long-term than longer duration U.S. bonds. Public stocks are managed using a
value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by
stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. Longer
duration U.S. bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in
interest rates. Alternative (private)&nbsp;investments are used to provide expected
returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. Additionally, the
Company engages currency overlay managers in an attempt to increase returns by
protecting non-U.S. dollar denominated assets from a rise in the relative value
of the U.S. dollar. The Company also participates in securities lending
programs in order to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to
borrowers on a fully collateralized basis.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>11. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (SFAS
142). SFAS 142 requires the Company to test goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets (for AMR, route acquisition costs) for impairment rather than
amortize them. In so doing, the Company determined its entire goodwill balance
of $1.4&nbsp;billion was impaired. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company&#146;s net
book value was determined to be in excess of the Company&#146;s fair value at
January&nbsp;1, 2002, using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes of the fair value
determination. The Company determined its fair value as of January&nbsp;1, 2002
using market capitalization as the primary indicator of fair value. As a
result, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January&nbsp;1,
2002, of $988&nbsp;million ($6.35 per share, net of a tax benefit of $363&nbsp;million)
to write-off all of AMR&#146;s goodwill. The tax benefit of $363&nbsp;million differed
from the amount computed at the statutory federal income tax rate due to a
portion of AMR&#146;s goodwill not being deductible for federal tax purposes. The
charge is nonoperational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of
accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The pro forma effect of discontinuing amortization of goodwill and route
acquisition costs under SFAS 142 &#151; assuming the Company had adopted this
standard as of January&nbsp;1, 2001 &#151; results in an adjusted net loss of
approximately $1,722&nbsp;million, or $11.17 per share for the year ended December
31, 2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company had route acquisition costs (including international slots) of $829
million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. The Company&#146;s impairment analysis for
route acquisition costs did not result in an impairment charge in 2003 or 2002.

intangible assets as of December&nbsp;31 (in millions):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 14&nbsp;million,
four million and 11&nbsp;million potential dilutive shares, respectively, were not
added to the denominator because inclusion of such shares would be
antidilutive. In addition, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, approximately
17&nbsp;million shares issuable upon conversion of the Company&#146;s 4.25&nbsp;percent
convertible notes discussed in Note 6 were not added to the denominator because
the inclusion of such shares would be antidilutive.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>14. Segment Reporting</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s operations of American and AMR Eagle are managed as a single
business unit providing for an integrated route network. The aircraft of these
carriers are combined to form one fleet, which is deployed through a combined
route scheduling system to maximize the operating results of the entire fleet.
The Company&#146;s chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation
decisions to maximize the Company&#146;s consolidated financial results, not the
individual results of American or AMR Eagle. Based on the way the Company&#146;s
operations are managed and the manner in which resource allocation decisions
are made, the Company has only one operating segment consisting of the
operations of American and AMR Eagle.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Following the acquisition of TWA in April&nbsp;2001, American is the largest
scheduled passenger airline in the world. At the end of 2003, American
provided scheduled jet service to approximately 150 destinations throughout
North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. American
is also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world,
providing a full range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its
system. AMR Eagle owns two regional airlines, which do business as &#147;American
Eagle&#148; &#151; American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. The
American Eagle carriers provide connecting service from eight of American&#146;s
high-traffic cities to smaller markets throughout the United States, Canada,
and the Caribbean.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues from other segments are below the quantitative threshold for
determining reportable segments and consist primarily of revenues from AMR
Investment Services, Inc. and Americas Ground Services, Inc. The difference
between the financial information of the Company&#146;s one reportable segment and
the financial information included in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not material.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the above items, in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
reached an agreement with the IRS covering tax years 1990 through 1995. As a
result of this agreement, the Company recorded an $80&nbsp;million tax benefit to
reduce previously accrued income tax liabilities and an $84&nbsp;million reduction
in interest expense to reduce previously accrued interest related to the
accrued income tax liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Also in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized an $80&nbsp;million gain
on the sale of the Company&#146;s investment in Hotwire and a $70&nbsp;million gain
related to an Orbitz initial public offering and a related secondary offering.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Furthermore, during the second quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $57
million charge for the displacement of foreign tax credits resulting from a
provision in Congress&#146; economic stimulus package. The provision changed the
period for carrybacks of NOLs from two to five years and allowed the Company to
more quickly recover its NOLs. However, the extended NOL carryback resulted in
the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.

15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This
term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company&#146;s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO)&nbsp;and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. Based on
that evaluation, the Company&#146;s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded
that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003. There have been no significant changes in the Company&#146;s
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
controls over financial reporting.

Mr. John W. Bachmann
Managing Director
Edward Jones
12555 Manchester Road
St. Louis, MO 63131-3279

Dear John:

         This will confirm the following agreement relating to the deferral of
your director's fees in 2004.

         1. All director's fees and retainers ("Fees") payable to you in
connection with your service on the boards of directors (including committees of
such boards) of AMR Corporation and American Airlines, Inc. for the period
January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004, will be deferred and paid to you in
accordance with this letter agreement.

         2. Fees will be converted to Stock Equivalent Units in accordance with
the Directors' Stock Equivalent Purchase Plan, a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Plan").

         3. Within 30 days of the date when you cease to be a Director of AMR
Corporation, the Stock Equivalent Units accrued pursuant to the Plan will be
converted to cash and paid to you by multiplying the number of such Stock
Equivalent Units by the arithmetic mean of the high and the low of AMR stock
("fair market value") during the month when you ceased to be a Director of AMR
Corporation.

         4. AMR's obligation to make the payment pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof
will not be released or modified by reason of your death. In such event, the
number of Stock Equivalent Units as of your date of death will be multiplied by
the fair market value of AMR stock during the calendar month immediately
preceding your death, and the amount paid to Katharine Bachmann.

Mr. Edward A. Brennan
400 North Michigan Avenue
Suite 400

Dear Ed:

         You've elected to defer your retainer and meeting fees for calendar
year 2004.

         In June 1998, you and the Company entered into an agreement governing
the fees you had deferred through that date. That agreement is attached.

         I'm assuming you want to continue to defer your fees in accordance with
the June 1998 letter. If so, please sign below and return to me. If you want
another agreement, please let me know the details and we'll see what we can do.

         Thank you for your cooperation and if there are questions, please let
me know.


                                                   Very truly yours,



                                                   Charles D. MarLett
                                                   Corporate Secretary


Deferral of 2004 fees to be in accordance with June 2, 1998 letter:



AGREED: /s/ Edward A. Brennan         DATE: 1/19/2004
        --------------------------          ---------------------
        Edward A. Brennan


P.S. I'm enclosing two originals - one to be returned to me and the other for
your files.

                  (b) to determine whether and to what extent LTIP Awards, or

                  (c) subject to the provisions of Sections 3, 5 and 11, to

         or any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions
         regarding any Stock Option or other award and/or the shares of Stock
         relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Committee
         shall determine in its sole discretion);

                  (e) to determine whether, to what extent and under what
         circumstances a Stock Option may be settled in cash, Restricted Stock
         and/or Deferred Stock under Section 5(k) or 5(1), as applicable,
         instead of Stock;

                  (f) to determine whether, to what extent and under what
         circumstances an award of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock may be

         other cash awards made by the Company are to be made, and operate, on a
         tandem basis vis-a-vis other awards under the Plan and/or cash awards
         made outside of the Plan, or on an additive basis;

                  (h) to determine whether, to what extent and under what
         circumstances Stock and other amounts payable with respect to an award
         under this Plan shall be deferred either automatically or at the

         during any deferral period);

                  (i) to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to
         Stock Purchase Rights and the Stock purchased by exercising such
         Rights;

         Awards, or not at all;

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (k) with respect to an award of Deferred Stock, to determine
         whether any dividends declared with respect to such award will be paid
         in cash, Restricted Stock, additional Deferred Stock, Other Stock Based
         Awards, or not at all; and

                  (l) to determine the terms and conditions pursuant to which an
         LTIP Award may vest on a pro rata basis or be terminated.

         The Committee shall have the authority: to adopt, alter and repeal such
rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan as it shall, from time to
time, deem advisable; to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any
award issued under the Plan (and any agreements relating thereto); and to
otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.

         All decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the
Plan shall be made in the Committee's sole discretion and shall be final and
binding on all persons, including the Company and Plan participants.

         SECTION 3. Stock Subject to Plan.

         The total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for
distribution under the Plan shall be 5,000,000 shares, plus any shares remaining
available for issuance under the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, as
of the Effective Date hereof. Such shares may consist, in whole or in part, of
authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.

         Subject to Section 6(b)(iv) below, if any shares of Stock that have
been optioned cease to be subject to a Stock Option, or if any such shares of
Stock that are subject to any Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock award, Stock
Purchase Right, Other Stock Based Award or Performance Related Award granted
hereunder or granted under the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, are
forfeited or any such award otherwise terminates without a payment being made to
the participant in the form of Stock, such shares shall again be available for
distribution in connection with future awards under the Plan.

         In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation,
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or other change in corporate
structure affecting the Stock, such substitution or adjustment shall be made in
the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, in the
number and option price of shares subject to outstanding Options granted under
the Plan, in the number and purchase price of shares subject to outstanding
Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, and in the number of shares subject to
other outstanding awards granted under the Plan as may be determined to be
appropriate by the Committee, in its sole discretion, provided that the number
of shares subject to any award shall always be a whole number. Such adjusted
option price shall also be used to determine the amount payable by the Company
upon the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right associated with any Stock
Option.

                                       5

         SECTION 4. Eligibility.

         Officers and other key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates (but excluding members of the Committee and any person who serves
only as a director) who are responsible for, or contribute to, the management,
growth and/or profitability of the business of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates are eligible for awards under the Plan.

         SECTION 5. Stock Options.

         Stock Options may be granted alone, in addition to, or in tandem with,
other awards granted under the Plan. Any Stock Option granted under the Plan
shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve.

         Stock Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive
Stock Options; and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options.

         The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any optionee
Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of Stock
Options (in each case with or without Stock Appreciation Rights); provided that,
in no event shall the number of shares of Stock subject to any Stock Options
granted to any employee during any calendar year exceed 250,000 shares, as such
number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.

         Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable:

         (a) Option Price. The option price per share of Stock purchasable under
a Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant;
provided, that such option price may not be less than the Fair Market Value of
the Stock on the date the Stock Option is granted.

         (b) Option Term. The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the
Committee, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten (10) years
after the date the Option is granted.

         (c) Exercisability. Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or
times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the
Committee; provided, however, that except as determined by the Committee, no
Stock Option shall be exercisable prior to the first anniversary date of the
granting of the Option. If the Committee provides, in its sole discretion, that
any Stock Option is exercisable only in installments, the Committee may waive
such installment exercise provisions at any time in whole or in part, based on
such factors as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.

         (d) Method of Exercise. Subject to whatever installment exercise
provisions apply under Section 5(c) and subject to whatever restrictions may be
imposed by the Company, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at
any time during the option period, by giving written notice of exercise to the
Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased.

                                       6
<PAGE>

         Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase
price. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payment of the option
price may be made: (i) in cash or its equivalent; (ii) by exchanging shares of
Stock owned by the optionee (which are not the subject of any pledge or other
security interest), including in the case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option,
Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock subject to an award hereunder (or an award
under the terms of the 1988 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended); (iii) through
an arrangement with a broker approved by the Company whereby payment of the
exercise price is accomplished with the proceeds of the sale of Stock; or (iv)
by any combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all
cash and cash equivalents paid and the Fair Market Value of any such Stock so
tendered to the Company, valued as of the date of such tender, is at least equal
to such option price.

         If payment of the option exercise price of a Non-Qualified Stock Option
is made in whole or in part in the form of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock,
such Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock (and any replacement shares relating
thereto) shall remain (or be) restricted or deferred, as the case may be, in
accordance with the original terms of the Restricted Stock award or Deferred
Stock award in question, and any additional Stock received upon the exercise
shall be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions or deferral limitations,
unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.

         No shares of Stock shall be issued upon exercise of a stock option
until full payment therefor has been made. An optionee shall generally have the
rights to dividends or other rights of a shareholder with respect to shares
subject to the Option when the optionee has given written notice of exercise,
has paid in full for such shares, and, if requested, has given the
representation described in Section 15(a).

         (e) Transferability of Options. Unless the Committee shall permit (on
such terms and conditions as it shall establish) an Option to be transferred to
a member of the participant's immediate family or to a trust or similar vehicle
for the benefit of such immediate family members, no Option shall be assignable
or transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and
except to the extent required by law, no right or interest of any participant
shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of the participant.

         (f) Termination by Death. Subject to Section 5(j), if an optionee's
employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate terminates by reason
of death, any Stock Option held by such optionee may thereafter be exercised in
accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Committee.

         (g) Termination by Reason of Disability. Subject to Section 5(j), if an
optionee's employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate terminates
by reason of Disability, any Stock Option held by such optionee may thereafter
be exercised by the optionee in accordance with the terms and conditions
established by the Committee. In the event of termination of employment by
reason of Disability, if an Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the
expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Section 422 of the
Code, such Stock Option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock
Option.

                                       7
<PAGE>

         (h) Termination by Reason of Retirement. Subject to Section 5(j), if an
optionee's employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate terminates
by reason of Normal or Early Retirement, any Stock Option held by such optionee
may thereafter be exercised by the optionee in accordance with the terms and
conditions established by the Committee. In the event of termination of
employment by reason of Retirement, if an Incentive Stock Option is exercised
after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Section
422 of the Code, such Stock Option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified
Stock Option.

         (i) Other Termination. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if
an optionee's employment by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
terminates for any reason other than death, Disability or Normal or Early
Retirement, the Stock Option shall thereupon terminate.

         (j) Incentive Stock Options. Anything in the Plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall
be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority
granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under
Section 422 of the Code, or, without the consent of the optionee(s) affected, to
disqualify any Incentive Stock Option under such Section 422.

         (k) Buyout Provisions. The Committee may at any time offer to buy out
for a payment in cash, Stock, Deferred Stock or Restricted Stock, an option
previously granted hereunder, based on such terms and conditions as the
Committee shall establish and communicate to the participant at the time that
such offer is made.

         (l) Settlement Provisions. If the option agreement so provides at grant
or is amended after grant, and prior to the exercise, to so provide (with the
optionee's consent), the Committee may require that all or part of the shares to
be issued with respect to the spread value of an exercised Option take the form
of Deferred or Restricted Stock, which shall be valued on the date of exercise
on the basis of the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Committee) of such
Deferred or Restricted Stock determined without regard to the deferral
limitations and/or the forfeiture restrictions involved.

         SECTION 6. Stock Appreciation Rights.

         (a) Grant and Exercise. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in
conjunction with all or part of any Stock Option granted under the Plan. In the
case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, such rights may be granted either at or
after the time of the grant of such Stock Option. In the case of an Incentive
Stock Option, such rights may be granted only at the time of grant of such Stock
Option.

         A Stock Appreciation Right or applicable portion thereof granted with
respect to a given Stock Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable
upon the termination or exercise of the related Stock Option, subject to such
provisions as the Committee may specify at grant where a Stock Appreciation
Right is granted with respect to less than the full number of shares covered by
a related Stock Option.

                                       8
<PAGE>

         A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by an optionee, subject to
Section 6(b), in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee for
such purposes. Upon such exercise, the optionee shall be entitled to receive an
amount determined in the manner prescribed in Section 6(b). Stock Options
relating to exercised Stock Appreciation Rights shall no longer be exercisable
to the extent that the related Stock Appreciation Rights have been exercised.

         (b) Terms and Conditions. Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to
such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as
shall be determined from time to time by the Committee, including the following:

                  (i) Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable only at
         such time or times and to the extent that the Stock Options to which
         they relate shall be exercisable in accordance with the provisions of
         Section 5 and this Section 6 of the Plan.

                  (ii) Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, an
         optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash and/or shares
         of Stock equal in value to the excess of the Fair Market Value of one
         share of Stock over the option price per share specified in the related
         Stock Option multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which the
         Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised, with the Committee
         having the right to determine the form of payment. When payment is to
         be made in shares, the number of shares to be paid shall be calculated
         on the basis of the Fair Market Value of the shares on the date of
         exercise.

                  (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights shall be transferable only
         when and to the extent that the underlying Stock Option would be
         transferable under Section 5(e) of the Plan.

                  (iv) Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the
         Stock Option or part thereof to which such Stock Appreciation Right is
         related shall be deemed to have been exercised for the purpose of the
         limitation set forth in Section 3 of the Plan on the number of shares
         of Stock exercised under the Plan, but only to the extent of the number
         of shares issued under the Stock Appreciation Right at the time of
         exercise based on the value of the Stock Appreciation Right at such
         time.

                  (v) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide that,
         in the event of a Change in Control and/or a Potential Change in
         Control, the amount to be paid upon the exercise of a Stock
         Appreciation Right shall be based on the Change in Control Price,
         subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify at
         grant.

         SECTION 7. Restricted Stock

         (a) Administration. Shares of Restricted Stock may be issued either
alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, other awards granted under the Plan
and/or awards made outside of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the
eligible persons to whom, and the time or times at which,

grants of Restricted Stock will be made, the number of shares to be awarded, the
price (if any) to be paid by the recipient of Restricted Stock (subject to
Section 7(b)), the time or times within which such awards may be subject to
forfeiture, and all other terms and conditions of the awards.

         The Committee may condition the grant of Restricted Stock upon the
attainment of specified Performance Criteria or such other factors as the
Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.

         The provisions of Restricted Stock awards need not be the same with
respect to each recipient.

         (b) Awards and Certificates. The prospective recipient of a Restricted
Stock award shall not have any rights with respect to such award, unless and
until the Company and such recipient have executed an agreement evidencing the
award and the recipient has delivered a fully executed copy thereof to the
Company, and has otherwise complied with the applicable terms and conditions of
such award.

                  (i) The purchase price for shares of Restricted Stock shall be
         equal to or less than their par value and may be zero.

                  (ii) Awards of Restricted Stock must be accepted within a
         reasonable period (or such specific period as the Committee may specify
         at grant) after the award date, by executing a Restricted Stock award
         agreement and paying whatever price (if any) is required under Section
         7(b)(i).

                  (iii) Each participant receiving a Restricted Stock award
         shall be issued a stock certificate in respect of such shares of
         Restricted Stock. Such certificate shall be registered in the name of
         such participant, and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the
         terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such award.

                  (iv) The Committee shall require that the stock certificates
         evidencing such shares be held in custody by the Company until the
         restrictions thereon shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any
         Restricted Stock award, the participant shall have delivered a stock
         power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Stock covered by such award.

         (c) Terms and Conditions. The shares of Restricted Stock awarded
pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

                  (i) Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the award
         agreement, during a period set by the Committee commencing with the
         date of such award (the "Restriction Period"), the participant shall
         not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge or assign shares of
         Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan. Within these limits and
         subject to Sections 7(c)(iv) and/or 7(c)(v), the Committee, in its sole
         discretion, may provide for the lapse of such restrictions in
         installments and may accelerate or waive such restrictions in whole or


                                       10
<PAGE>

         in part, based on service, Performance Criteria and/or such other
         factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.

                  (ii) If and when the Restriction Period expires without a
         prior forfeiture of the Restricted Stock subject to such Restriction
         Period, certificates for an appropriate number of unrestricted shares
         of Stock shall be delivered to the participant promptly (unless the
         Committee decides pursuant to Section 2(f) to settle the award in
         cash).

                  (iii) The voting rights and/or dividend rights, if any, of the
         Restricted Stock award shall be established by the Committee pursuant
         to Section 2(j).

                  (iv) An award of Restricted Stock, where the Restriction
         Period is based on Performance Criteria, shall have a Restriction
         Period of at least one (1) year.

                  (v) An award of Restricted Stock, where the Restriction Period
         is based on service, shall have a Restriction Period of at least three
         (3) years.

         (d) Minimum Value Provisions. In order to better ensure that award
payments actually reflect the performance of the Company and service of the
participant, the Committee may provide, in its sole discretion, for a tandem
performance-based or other award designed to guarantee a minimum value, payable
in cash or Stock to the recipient of a Restricted Stock award, subject to such
Performance Criteria, future service, deferral and other terms and conditions as
may be specified by the Committee.

         SECTION 8. Deferred Stock.

         (a) Administration. Deferred Stock may be awarded either alone, in
addition to, or in tandem with, other awards granted under the Plan and/or
awards made outside of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the eligible
persons to whom and the time or times at which Deferred Stock shall be awarded,
the number of shares of Deferred Stock to be awarded to any person, the duration
of the period (the "Deferral Period") during which, and the conditions under
which, receipt of the Stock will be deferred, and the other terms and conditions
of the award in addition to those set forth in Section 8(b).

         The Committee may condition the grant of Deferred Stock upon the
attainment of specified Performance Criteria or such other factors or criteria
as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.

         The provisions of Deferred Stock awards need not be the same with
respect to each recipient.

         (b) Terms and Conditions. The shares of Deferred Stock awarded pursuant
to this Section 8 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

                                       11
<PAGE>

                  (i) Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the award
         agreement referred to in Section 8(b)(iv) below, Deferred Stock awards
         may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered
         during the Deferral Period. At the expiration of the Deferral Period
         (or the Elective Deferral Period referred to in Section 8(b)(iii),
         where applicable), stock certificates shall be delivered to the
         participant, or his legal representative, in a number equal to the
         shares covered by the Deferred Stock award (unless the Committee
         decides pursuant to Section 2(f) to settle the award in cash).

                  (ii) Subject to Sections 8(b)(vi) and/or 8(b)(vii), the
         Committee may accelerate the vesting of all or any part of any Deferred
         Stock award and/or waive the deferral limitations in whole or in part,
         based on service, Performance Criteria and/or such other factors as the
         Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.

                  (iii) A participant may elect to further defer receipt of an
         award (or an installment of an award) for a specified period or until a
         specified event (the "Elective Deferral Period"), subject in each case
         to such terms as are determined by the Committee, all in its sole
         discretion. Subject to any exceptions adopted by the Committee, such
         election must generally be made at least twelve (12) months prior to
         completion of the Deferral Period for such Deferred Stock award (or
         such installment).

                  (iv) Each award shall be confirmed by, and subject to the
         terms of, a Deferred Stock agreement executed by the Company and the
         participant.

                  (v) The dividend rights, if any, of the Deferred Stock award
         established by the Committee pursuant to Section 2(k).

                  (vi) An award of Deferred Stock, where the Deferral Period is
         based on Performance Criteria, shall have a Deferral Period of at least
         one (1) year.

                  (vii) An award of Deferred Stock, where the Deferral Period is
         based on service, shall have a Deferral Period of at least three (3)
         years.

         (c) Minimum Value Provisions. In order to better ensure that award
payments actually reflect the performance of the Company and service of the
participant, the Committee may provide, in its sole discretion, for a tandem
performance-based or other award designed to guarantee a minimum value, payable
in cash or Stock to the recipient of a Deferred Stock award, subject to such
Performance Criteria, future service, deferral and other terms and conditions as
may be specified by the Committee.

         SECTION 9. Stock Purchase Rights.

         (a) Awards and Administration. The Committee may grant eligible
participants Stock Purchase Rights which shall enable such participants to
purchase Stock (including Deferred Stock and Restricted Stock) at price(s)
determined by the Committee at or after grant, in its sole discretion.

                                       12
<PAGE>

         The Committee shall also impose such deferral, forfeiture and/or other
terms and conditions as it shall determine, in its sole discretion, on such
Stock Purchase Rights or the exercise thereof.

         The terms of Stock Purchase Rights awards need not be the same with
respect to each participant.

         Each Stock Purchase Right award shall be confirmed by, and be subject
to the terms of, a Stock Purchase Rights agreement.

         (b) Exercisability. Stock Purchase Rights shall be exercisable for such
period after grant as is determined by the Committee.

         SECTION 10. Other Stock Based Awards.

         (a) Administration. Other awards of Stock and other awards that are
valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, Stock
("Other Stock Based Awards"), including, without limitation, stock purchase
rights, performance shares, convertible preferred stock, convertible debentures,
exchangeable securities and Stock awards or options valued by reference to Book
Value or subsidiary performance, may be granted either alone, in addition to, or
in tandem with, Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock,
Deferred Stock, Stock Purchase Rights or Performance Related Awards granted
under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan.

         Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have
authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such
awards shall be made, the amount of such awards, and all other conditions of the
awards including any dividend and/or voting rights. Subject to Sections
10(b)(iv) and 10(b)(v), the Committee may also provide for the grant of Stock
upon the attainment of specified Performance Criteria or such other factors as
the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.

         The provisions of Other Stock Based Awards need not be the same with
respect to each recipient.

         (b) Terms and Conditions. Other Stock Based Awards made pursuant to
this Section 10 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

                  (i) Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the award
         agreement referred to in Section 10(b)(ii) below, awards made under
         this Section 10 may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or
         otherwise encumbered prior to the date on which any shares are issued
         or amounts are paid, or, if later, the date on which any applicable
         restriction, performance or deferral period lapses. Subject to Sections
         10(b)(iv) and/or 10(b)(v), the Committee, in its sole discretion, may
         accelerate the vesting of all or any part of any Other Stock Based
         Award, and/or waive any restrictions or deferral limitations in whole


                                       13
<PAGE>

         or in part, based on service, Performance Criteria and/or other factors
         as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.

                  (ii) Each award under this Section 10 shall be confirmed by,
         and subject to the terms of, an agreement or other instrument by the
         Company and by the participant.

                  (iii) Stock (including securities convertible into Stock)
         issued on a bonus basis under this Section 10 may be issued for no cash
         consideration. Stock (including securities convertible into Stock)
         purchased pursuant to a purchase right awarded under this Section 10
         shall be purchased at price(s) determined by the Committee, in its sole
         discretion.

                  (iv) Any Other Stock Based Award that has a Restriction Period
         or Deferral Period that is based on Performance Criteria shall have a
         Restriction Period or Deferral Period, as the case may be, of at least
         one (1) year.

                  (v) Any Other Stock Based Award that has a Restriction Period
         or Deferral Period that is based on service shall have a Restriction
         Period or Deferral Period, as the case may be, of at least three (3)
         years.

         SECTION 11. Performance Related Awards.

         (a) Performance Objectives. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
the Plan to the contrary, unless the Committee otherwise determines at the time
of grant, any award of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock or Other Stock Based
Awards to an officer who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act other than an award which will vest solely on the
basis of the passage of time, shall become vested, if at all, upon the
determination by the Committee that performance objectives established by the
Committee have been attained, in whole or in part (a "Performance Award"). Such
performance objectives shall be determined over a measurement period or periods
established by the Committee (which period or periods shall not be less than one
(1) year) and related to at least one of the following criteria, which may be
determined solely by reference to the performance of: (i) the Company; (ii) a
Subsidiary; (iii) an Affiliate; (iv) a division or unit of any of the foregoing
or based on comparative performance of any of the foregoing relative to past
performance or to other companies: (A) return on equity; (B) total shareholder
return; (C) revenues; (D) cash flows, revenues and/or earnings relative to other
parameters (e.g., net or gross assets); (E) operating income; (F) return on
investment; (G) changes in the value of the Stock; and (H) return on assets (the
"Performance Criteria"). Excluding Stock Options and/or Stock Appreciation
Rights granted hereunder, the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be
subject to any such Performance Award granted to any key employee in any
calendar year shall not exceed 100,000 shares, as such number may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.

         (b) Annual Incentive Compensation. The Committee may, in addition to
the Performance Awards described above, pay cash amounts under the Plan or any
other plan or arrangement approved by the Committee, provided such other plan or
arrangement is in


                                       14
<PAGE>

conformity with the provisions of this Section 11(b), to any officer of the
Company or any Subsidiary who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act upon the achievement, in whole or in part, of
performance goals or objectives established in writing by the Committee with
respect to such performance periods as the Committee shall determine. Any such
goals or objectives shall be based on one or more of the Performance Criteria.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, the maximum
amount of any such cash payment to any single officer with respect to any
calendar year shall not exceed the lesser of (i) $2,000,000; or (ii) twice the
officer's annual base salary as in effect on the last day of the preceding
fiscal year.

         (c) Interpretation. Notwithstanding anything else contained in the Plan
to the contrary, to the extent required to so qualify any Performance Award as
other performance based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C)
of the Code, the Committee shall not be entitled to exercise any discretion
otherwise authorized under the Plan (such as the right to accelerate vesting
without regard to the achievement of the relevant performance objectives) with
respect to such Performance Award if the ability to exercise such discretion (as
opposed to the exercise of such discretion) would cause such award to fail to
qualify as other performance based compensation.

         SECTION 12. Change in Control Provisions.

         (a) Impact of Event. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
7(c)(iv), 7(c)(v), 8(b)(vi), 8(b)(vii), 10(b)(iv), and 10(b)(v), in the event
of:

                  (i) a "Change in Control" as defined in Section 12(b), or

                  (ii) a "Potential Change in Control" as defined in Section
         12(c), but only if and to the extent so determined by the Committee or
         the Board (subject to any right of approval expressly reserved by the
         Committee or the Board at the time of such determination):

                  (A) Any Stock Options awarded under the Plan not previously
         exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested;

                  (B) The restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to
         any Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Stock Purchase Rights, Other
         Stock Based Awards and Performance Related Awards, in each case to the
         extent not already vested under the Plan, shall lapse and such shares
         and awards shall be deemed fully vested and any Performance Criteria
         shall be deemed met at target; and

                  (C) The value of all outstanding LTIP Awards to the extent
         vested may at the sole discretion of the Committee at or after grant
         but prior to any Change in Control, be cashed out on the basis of the
         "Change in Control Price" as defined in Section 12(d) as of the date
         such Change in Control or such Potential Change in Control is
         determined to


                                       15
<PAGE>

         have occurred or such other date as the Committee may determine prior
         to the Change in Control.

         (b) Definition of "Change in Control". For purposes of Section 12(a), a
"Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

                  (i) When any "person" as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the
         Exchange Act and as used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, including
         a "group" as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act but excluding
         the Company, any Subsidiary or any employee benefit plan sponsored or
         maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary (including any trustee of
         such plan acting as trustee), directly or indirectly, becomes the
         "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, as
         amended from time to time), of securities of the Company representing
         fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of the
         Company's then outstanding securities;

                  (ii) The individuals who, as of the Effective Date of this
         Plan, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason
         to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that
         any individual becoming a director subsequent to the Effective Date of
         the Plan whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's
         shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the
         directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as
         though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
         excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial
         assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened
         election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors
         or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or
         on behalf of a person other than the Board; or

                  (iii) Consummation of a reorganization, merger or
         consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
         of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of assets of another
         corporation (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following
         such Business Combination: (A) all or substantially all of the
         individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively,
         of the then outstanding shares of Stock of the Company and the combined
         voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company
         entitled to vote generally in the election of directors immediately
         prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or
         indirectly, more than sixty percent (60%) of, respectively, the then
         outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the
         then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the
         election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting
         from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a
         corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or
         all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or
         through one or more subsidiaries); (B) no person (excluding any
         employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such
         corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially
         owns, directly or indirectly, fifteen percent (15%) or more of,
         respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
         corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined
         voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such
         corporation except to the extent that such


                                       16
<PAGE>

         ownership existed prior to the Business Combination; and (C) at least a
         majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation
         resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent
         Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the
         action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

                  (iv) Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete
         liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

         (c) Definition of Potential Change in Control. For purposes of Section
12(a), a "Potential Change in Control" means the happening of any one of the
following:

                  (i) The approval by shareholders of an agreement by the
         Company, the consummation of which would result in a Change in Control
         of the Company as defined in Section 12(b); or

                  (ii) The acquisition of beneficial ownership, directly or
         indirectly, by any entity, person or group (other than the Company or a
         Subsidiary or any Company employee benefit plan (including any trustee
         of such plan acting as such trustee)) of securities of the Company
         representing five percent (5%) or more of the combined voting power of
         the Company's outstanding securities and the adoption by the Board of a
         resolution to the effect that a Potential Change in Control of the
         Company has occurred for purposes of this Plan.

         (d) Change in Control Price. For the purposes of this Section 12,
"Change in Control Price" means the highest price per share paid in any
transaction reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, or paid or
offered in any bona fide transaction related to a potential or actual Change in
Control of the Company at any time during the sixty (60) day period immediately
preceding the occurrence of the Change in Control (or, where applicable, the
occurrence of the Potential Change in Control event), in each case as determined
by the Committee except that, in the case of Incentive Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights relating to Incentive Stock Options, such price shall be
based only on transactions reported for the date on which the optionee exercises
such Stock Appreciation Rights or, where applicable, the date on which a cashout
occurs under Section 12(a)(ii)(C).

         SECTION 13. Amendments and Termination.

         The Board may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment,
alteration, or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of an
optionee or participant under an LTIP Award theretofore granted, without the
optionee's or participant's consent.

         The Committee may amend the terms of any Stock Option or other award
theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but subject to Section 3
above, no such amendment shall impair the rights of any holder without the
holder's consent.

                                       17
<PAGE>

         Subject to the above provisions, the Board shall have broad authority
to amend the Plan to take into account changes in applicable securities and tax
laws and accounting rules, as well as other developments.

         SECTION 14. Unfunded Status of Plan.

         The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and
deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a
participant or optionee by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any
such participant or optionee any rights that are greater than those of a general
creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the
creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under
the Plan to deliver Stock or payments in lieu of or with respect to awards
hereunder; provided, however, that unless the Committee otherwise determines
with the consent of the affected participant, the existence of such trusts or
other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.

         SECTION 15. General Provisions.

         (a) The Committee may require each person purchasing shares pursuant to
a Stock Option or other award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the
Company in writing that the optionee or participant is acquiring the shares
without a view to distribution thereof. The certificates for such shares may
include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any
restrictions on transfer.

         All certificates for shares of Stock or other securities delivered
under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other
restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations,
and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock
exchange upon which the Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or
state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put
on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

         (b) Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from
adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder
approval if such approval is required, and such arrangements may be either
generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

         (c) The adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate any right to continued employment with
the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may be, nor shall it
interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate
to terminate the employment of any of its employees at any time.

         (d) Except as the participant and the Company may otherwise agree, no
later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross
income of the participant for federal income tax purposes with respect to any
award under the Plan, the participant shall pay to the Company, or make
arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding the payment of, any


                                       18
<PAGE>

federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with
respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee,
withholding obligations may be settled with Stock, including Stock that is part
of the award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of
the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall, to the extent
permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of
any kind otherwise due to the participant.

         (e) The actual or deemed reinvestment of dividends or dividend
equivalents in additional Restricted Stock (or in Deferred Stock or other types
of Plan awards) at the time of any dividend payment shall only be permissible if
sufficient shares of Stock are available under Section 3 for such reinvestment
(taking into account then outstanding Stock Options, Stock Purchase Rights and
other Plan awards).

         (f) The Committee may permit a participant to postpone the delivery of
Stock under any award, including a Stock Option, under the Plan upon such terms
and conditions as the Committee shall determine.

         (g) The Plan and all awards made and actions taken thereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

         SECTION 16. Effective Date of Plan.

         As amended, the Plan shall be effective as of May 21, 1998.

         SECTION 17. Term of Plan.

         No LTIP Award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan on or after the
tenth anniversary of the date of shareholder approval, but awards granted prior
to such tenth anniversary may extend beyond that date, in accordance with the
terms of such awards.

         SECTION 18. Applicability to Grants under 1988 Plan.

         The provisions of the Plan relating to stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards, stock
purchase rights, other stock-based awards or performance related awards shall
apply to, and govern existing and subsequent stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards, stock purchase rights,
other stock-based awards or performance related awards granted under the 1988
Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended.

                                  STOCK OPTION
                       2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

         STOCK OPTION granted ______ by AMR Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Corporation"), and __________ employee number ________, an employee of the
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (the "Optionee").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board"), has
approved the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (such plan, as may be amended
from time to time, to be referenced the "2003 Plan"); and

         WHEREAS, the 2003 Plan provides for the grant of an option to purchase
shares of the Corporation's Common Stock (as later defined) to those individuals
selected by the Committee or, in lieu thereof, the Board of Directors of AMR
Corporation (the "Board"); and

         WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the Optionee is eligible under
the 2003 Plan and that it is to the advantage and interest of the Corporation to
grant the option provided for herein to the Optionee as an incentive for
Optionee to remain in the employ of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, and to encourage ownership by the Optionee of the Corporation's
Common Stock, $1 par value (the "Common Stock").

         NOW, THEREFORE:

         1. Option Grant. The Corporation hereby grants to the Optionee a
non-qualified stock option, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, to purchase all or any part of an aggregate of _______ shares of Common
Stock at a price of $________ per share (being the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date hereof), exercisable in approximately equal
installments on and after the following dates and with respect to the following
number of shares of Common Stock:

      Exercisable On and After                  Number of Shares
      ------------------------                  ----------------


                                                                               1
<PAGE>

Provided, that in no event shall this option be exercisable in whole or in part
ten years from the date hereof and that the Corporation shall in no event be
obligated to issue fractional shares. The right to exercise this option and to
purchase the number of shares comprising each such installment shall be
cumulative, and once such right has become exercisable it may be exercised in
whole at any time and in part from time to time until the date of termination of
the Optionee's rights hereunder.

         2. Restriction on Exercise. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
this option shall not be exercised if at such time such exercise or the delivery
of certificates representing shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant hereto
shall constitute a violation of any rule of the Corporation, any provision of
any applicable Federal or State statute, rule or regulation, or any rule or
regulation of any securities exchange on which the Common Stock may be listed.

         3. Manner of Exercise. This option may be exercised with respect to all
or any part of the shares of Common Stock then subject to such exercise pursuant
to whatever procedures may be adopted by the Corporation. In the event that at
the time of such exercise the shares of Common Stock as to which this option is
exercisable have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, the
Optionee will make a representation that he is acquiring the shares of Common
Stock for investment only and not with a view to distribution. Subject to
compliance by the Optionee with all the terms and conditions hereof, the
Corporation or its agent shall promptly thereafter deliver to the Optionee a
certificate or certificates for such shares with all requisite transfer stamps
attached. (In the event of a cashless exercise, the Corporation or its agent
will pay to the Optionee the appropriate cash amount, less required
withholdings.)

         4. Termination of Option. This option shall terminate and may no longer
be exercised if (i) the Optionee ceases to be an employee of the Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (ii) the Optionee becomes an employee
of a Subsidiary that is not wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation; or (iii) the Optionee takes a leave of absence without
reinstatement rights, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation
(or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) and the Optionee; except that

         (a) If the Optionee's employment by the Corporation (and any Subsidiary
or Affiliate) terminates by reason of death, the vesting of the option will be
accelerated and the option will remain exercisable until its expiration;


                                                                               2
<PAGE>

         (b) If the Optionee's employment by the Corporation (and any Subsidiary
or Affiliate) terminates by reason of Disability, the option will continue to
vest in accordance with its terms and may be exercised until its expiration;
provided, however, that if the Optionee dies after such Disability the vesting
of the option will be accelerated and the option will remain exercisable until
its expiration;

         (c) Subject to Section 7(c), if the Optionee's employment by the
Corporation (and any Subsidiary or Affiliate) terminates by reason of Normal or
Early Retirement, the option will continue to vest in accordance with its terms
and may be exercised until its expiration; provided, however, that if the
Optionee dies after Retirement the vesting of the option will be accelerated and
the option will remain exercisable until its expiration;

         (d) If the Optionee's employment by the Corporation (and any Subsidiary
or Affiliate) is involuntarily terminated by the Corporation or a Subsidiary or
Affiliate (as the case may be) without Cause, the option may thereafter be
exercised, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of termination, for a
period of three months from the date of such termination of employment or until
the stated term of such option, whichever period is shorter; and

         (e) In the event of a Change in Control or a Potential Change in
Control of the Corporation, this option shall become exercisable in accordance
with the 2003 Plan, or its successor.

         5. Adjustments in Common Stock. In the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other
change in the corporate structure, appropriate adjustments may be made by the
Board in the number of shares, class or classes of securities and the price per
share.

         6. Non-Transferability of Option. Unless the Committee shall permit (on
such terms and conditions as it shall establish), an option may not be
transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution to the extent
provided herein. During the lifetime of the Optionee this option may be
exercised only by him or her (unless otherwise determined by the Committee).

         7. Miscellaneous.

         (a) This option (i) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor of the Corporation, (ii) shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Texas, and any applicable laws of the United States, and (iii) may not
be amended except in writing. No contract or right of employment shall be
implied by this option.


                                                                               3
<PAGE>

         (b) If this option is assumed or a new option is substituted therefore
in any corporate reorganization (including, but not limited to, any transaction
of the type referred to in Section 425(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended), employment by such assuming or substituting corporation or by a
parent corporation or a subsidiary thereof shall be considered for all purposes
of this option to be employment by the Corporation.

         (c) In the event the Optionee's employment is terminated by reason of
Early or Normal Retirement and the Optionee subsequently is employed by a
competitor of the Corporation, the Corporation reserves the right, upon notice
to the Optionee, to declare the option forfeited and of no further validity.

         (d) In consideration of the employee's privilege to participate in the
Plan, the employee agrees (i) not to disclose any trade secrets of, or other
confidential/restricted information of, American Airlines, Inc. ("American") or
its Affiliates to any unauthorized party and (ii) not to make any unauthorized
use of such trade secrets or confidential or restricted information during his
or her employment with American or its Affiliates or after such employment is
terminated, and (iii) not to solicit any then current employees of American or
any other subsidiaries of the Corporation to join the employee at his or her new
place of employment after his or her employment with American or its Affiliates
is terminated.

         8. Securities Law Requirements. The Corporation shall not be required
to issue shares upon the exercise of this option unless and until (a) such
shares have been duly listed upon each stock exchange on which the Corporation's
Stock is then registered; and (b) a registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933 with respect to such shares is then effective.

         The Board may require the Optionee to furnish to the Corporation, prior
to the issuance of any shares of Stock in connection with the exercise of this
option, an agreement, in such form as the Board may from time to time deem
appropriate, in which the Optionee represents that the shares acquired by him
upon such exercise are being acquired for investment and not with a view to the
sale or distribution thereof.

         9. Option Subject to 2003 Plan. This option shall be subject to all the
terms and provisions of the 2003 Plan and the Optionee shall abide by and be
bound by all rules, regulations and determinations of the Board now or hereafter
made in connection with the administration of the 2003 Plan. Capitalized terms
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in
the 2003 Plan.


                                                                               4

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.54

                         DEFERRED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT

         This AGREEMENT made as of this ___________, by and between AMR
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and _________ (the
"Officer").

         WHEREAS, the stockholders of the Corporation approved the 1998 Long
Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the "1998 Plan") at the Corporation's annual
meeting held on May 20, 1998; and

         WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has
determined that Officer is a key executive and has further determined to make an
award of Deferred Stock to the Officer (subject to terms of the 1998 Plan and
this Agreement), as an inducement for the Officer to remain with the Corporation
(or a Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) and to motivate the Officer during such
employment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Officer hereby agree as
follows:

         1. Grant of Award.

         The Officer is hereby granted as of ___________ (the "Grant Date") a
Deferred Stock Award (the "Award"), subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, with respect to _______ shares of Common Stock, $1.00 par value, of
the Corporation (the "Stock"). The shares of Stock covered by the Award will
vest, if at all in accordance with Sections 2 and 3. VESTING DATE is hereby
established as the "Vesting Date" of the Award.

         2. Distribution of Award on and after the Vesting Date.

         Distribution of the Award on and after the Vesting Date will occur, if
at all, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

         (a) If the Officer is on the payroll of a Subsidiary that is wholly
owned by the Corporation as of the Vesting Date, the Award will be distributed
to the Officer in accordance with the following schedule:

<Table>
<Caption>
    Number of Shares               Date of Distribution            Tranche
    ----------------               --------------------            -------
<S>                                <C>                             <C>

</Table>

<PAGE>

Provided, however, if the Officer's employment with the Corporation (or a
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) is terminated after the Vesting Date but prior
to the complete distribution of the Award due to the Officer's death,
Disability, Retirement or termination not for Cause (each an "Early
Termination"), the distribution of any portion of the Award not already
distributed will be accelerated so as to occur as soon as practicable after such
Early Termination.

         (b) In the event of a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control
of the Corporation after the Vesting Date but prior to the complete distribution
of the Award, the Award will be paid in accordance with the 1998 Plan or its
successor.

         (c) Notwithstanding the terms of Section 2(a), the Award will be
forfeited in its entirety if after the Vesting Date but prior to the Award's
complete distribution:

         (i) The Officer's employment with the Corporation (or Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof) is terminated for Cause, or if the Officer terminates his/her
employment with the Corporation (or Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof);

         (ii) The Officer becomes an employee of a Subsidiary that is not wholly
owned by the Corporation; or

         (iii) The Officer takes a leave of absence without reinstatement
rights, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation and the
Officer.

         3. Distribution prior to Vesting Date.

         (a) In the event the Officer's employment with the Corporation (or a
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) terminates prior to the Vesting Date due to an
Early Termination, the Award will be distributed on a prorata basis (as
described in the second sentence of this Section 3(a)) and will be paid to the
Officer (or, in the event of the Officer's death, the Officer's designated
beneficiary for purposes of the Award, or in the absence of an effective
beneficiary designation, the Officer's estate) as soon as practicable after such
Early Termination. The prorata basis will be a percentage where (i) the
numerator is the number of months from the GRANT DATE to the month of early
termination, inclusive and (ii) the denominator is 36 for Tranche 1, 48 for
Tranche 2 and 60 for Tranche 3.

<PAGE>

For example, assuming an Early Termination occurring in month six, and an Award
of 300 shares for each of Tranche 1, Tranche 2 and Tranche 3, the payment would
be made with respect to:

<Table>
<Caption>
                Months in       # Months          # of
  Tranche         Plan         per Tranche        Shares            Shares

    1              6        /      36       X       300       =        50
    2              6        /      48       X       300       =       37.5
    3              6        /      60       X       300       =        30
  Total                                                               117.5
</Table>

         (b) In the event of a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control
of the Corporation prior to the Vesting Date, the Award will be paid in
accordance with the 1998 Plan or its successor.

         (c) The Award will be forfeited in its entirety if prior to the Vesting
Date:

         (i) The Officer's employment with the Corporation (or and Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof) is terminated for Cause, or if the Officer terminates his
employment with the Corporation (or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof);

         (ii) The Officer becomes an employee of a Subsidiary that is not wholly
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation; or

         (iii) The Officer takes a leave of absence without reinstatement
rights, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation and the
Officer

         4. Transfer Restrictions.

         Unless otherwise permitted by the CEO, this award is non-transferable
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not be
assigned, pledged or hypothecated and will not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt by the Officer (or the Officer's
successor in the interest after the Officer's death) to effect any such
disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, the Award may immediately
become null and void, at the discretion of the CEO.

         5. Miscellaneous.

         This Agreement (a) will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
successor of the Corporation, (b) will be governed by the laws of the State of
Texas and any applicable laws of the United States, and (c) may not be amended
without the written consent of both the Corporation and the Officer. No contract
or right of employment will be implied by this Agreement. In the event Officer
does not forward to the Corporation, within the applicable period, required
taxes with respect to any Award distributed pursuant to this Agreement, the

<PAGE>

Corporation may withhold from any payments to by made to the Officer by the
Corporation (or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) an amount(s) equal to such
taxes.

         6. Adjustments in Awards.

         In the event of a Stock dividend, Stock split, merger consolidation,
re-organization, re-capitalization or other change in the corporate structure of
the Company, appropriate adjustments may be made by the Board of Directors in
the number of shares awarded.

         7. Securities Law Requirements.

         The Corporation will not be required to issue Stock pursuant to this
Award unless and until (a) such shares have been duly listed upon each stock
exchange on which the Corporation's Stock is registered; and (b) a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to such shares is then
effective.

         The CEO may require the Officer to furnish to the Corporation, prior to
distribution of the Stock in connection with this Award, an agreement, in such
form as the CEO may from time to time deem appropriate, in which the Officer

                     2003 - 2005 PERFORMANCE UNIT AGREEMENT

         This performance unit agreement ("Agreement") is made this ____ day of
____ 2003, by and between AMR Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Corporation"), and _____________ (the "Employee" or "Recipient"), employee
number ________.

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the Performance Unit Program (the "Program")
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board"), the Board
has determined to make a Program grant to the Employee of performance units
(subject to the terms of the 2003 Performance Unit Plan (the "2003 Unit Plan")
and this Agreement), as an inducement for the Employee to remain an employee of
the Corporation (or a Subsidiary of Affiliate thereof), and to retain and
motivate such Employee during such employment.

         This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions attendant to the
performance units granted under the 2003 Unit Plan.

         1. Grant of Award. The Recipient is hereby granted as of ______, (the
"Grant Date") performance units (the "Award"), subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement with respect to _____ performance units
(collectively, the "Units"). The Units covered by the Award shall vest, if at
all, in accordance with Section 2. On the date the Units vest (if at all),
Recipient will receive, net of applicable withholding or applicable social
security taxes, a payment representing the product of (i) the number of vested
Units and (ii) the average of the high and low price of the Corporation's Common
Stock, $1.00 par value per share, on a date chosen by the Board, which date
shall be as soon as practicable after the end of the Measurement Period (as
defined below).

         2. Vesting.

         (a) The Units will vest, if at all, in accordance with Schedule A,
attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement.

         (b) In the event Recipient's employment with the Corporation (or a
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) is terminated prior to the end of the three
year measurement period set forth in Schedule A (the "Measurement Period") due
to the Recipient's death, Disability, Retirement or termination not for Cause
(each an "Early Termination") the Award will vest, if at all, on a prorata basis
and will be paid to the Employee (or, in the event of the Employee's death, the
Employee's designated beneficiary for purposes of the Award, or in the absence
of an effective beneficiary designation, the Employee's estate). The prorata
shares will be a percentage where the denominator is 36 and the numerator is the
number of months from January 1, 2003 through the month of Early Termination,
inclusive. The Award will be paid to the Recipient at or around the same time as
payments are made to then current employees who have been granted Units under
the 2003 Unit Plan.

                                                                               1
<PAGE>

         (c) In the event Recipient's employment with the Corporation (or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof) is terminated for Cause, or if the Recipient
terminates his/her employment with the Corporation (or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof), each occurring prior to the payment contemplated by this
Agreement, the Award shall be forfeited in its entirety.

         (d) If prior to the payment contemplated by this Agreement, the
Recipient becomes an employee of a Subsidiary that is not wholly owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Corporation, or if the Recipient begins a leave of absence
without reinstatement rights, then in each case the Award shall be forfeited in
its entirety.

         (e) In the event of a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control
of the Corporation, the Award shall vest in accordance with the 2003 Unit Plan,
or its successor.

         3. Transfer Restrictions. This Award is non-transferable otherwise than
by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not otherwise be
assigned, pledged or hypothecated and shall not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt by the Recipient (or the
Recipient's successor in interest after the Recipient's death) to effect any
such disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, the Award may
immediately become null and void, at the discretion of the Board.

         4. Miscellaneous. This Agreement (a) shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of any successor of the Corporation, (b) shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Texas and any applicable laws of the United States, and (c)
may not be amended without the written consent of both the Corporation and the
Recipient. No contract or right of employment shall be implied by this
Agreement.

                  In consideration of the employee's privilege to participate in
the Plan, the employee agrees (i) not to disclose any trade secrets of, or other
confidential/restricted information of, American Airlines, Inc. ("American") or
its Affiliates to any unauthorized party and (ii) not to make any unauthorized
use of such trade secrets or confidential or restricted information during his
or her employment with American or its Affiliates or after such employment is
terminated, and (iii) not to solicit any then current employees of American or
any other Subsidiaries of the Corporation to join the employee at his or her new
place of employment after his or her employment with American or its Affiliates
is terminated.

         5. Adjustments in Awards. In the event of a Stock dividend, Stock
split, merger, consolidation, re-organization, re-capitalization or other change
in the corporate structure of the Corporation, appropriate adjustments may be
made by the Board of Directors in the number of shares awarded.


                                                                               2

Purpose

The purpose of the 2003 - 2005 AMR Corporation Performance Unit Plan ("Plan")

Corporation.

Definitions

For purposes of the Plan, the following definitions will control:

"Affiliate" is defined as a subsidiary of AMR or any entity that is designated

classes of stock of such entity.

"Committee" is defined as the Compensation Committee, or its successor, of the
AMR Board of Directors.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                    EXECUTIVE TERMINATION BENEFITS AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE TERMINATION BENEFITS AGREEMENT
(this "Agreement"), dated as of the 20th day of May, 2003 is among AMR
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC., a Delaware
corporation (collectively the "Company"), and ROBERT W. REDING (the
"Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders that its management be encouraged to remain
with the Company and to continue to devote full attention to the Company's
business in the event an effort is made to obtain control of the Company through
a tender offer or otherwise;

         WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a change in
control and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management
may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the
detriment of the Company and its stockholders;

         WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has determined
that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued
attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing
circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the
Company;

         WHEREAS, the Executive is a key Executive of the Company;
<PAGE>


         WHEREAS, the Company believes the Executive has made valuable
contributions to the productivity and profitability of the Company;

         WHEREAS, should the Company receive any proposal from a third person
concerning a possible business combination with or acquisition of equity
securities of the Company, the Board believes it imperative that the Company and
the Board be able to rely upon the Executive to continue in his position, and
that the Company be able to receive and rely upon his advice as to the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders without concern that he might be
distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by such a proposal;
and

         WHEREAS, should the Company receive any such proposals, in addition to
the Executive's regular duties, he may be called upon to assist in the
assessment of such proposals, advise management and the Board as to whether such
proposals would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate.

         NOW, THEREFORE, to assure the Company that it will have the continued
undivided attention and services of the Executive and the availability of his
advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a
bid to take over control of the Company, and to induce the Executive to remain
in the employ of the Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
Company and the Executive agree as follows:

         1. Change in Control

         For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control of the Company
shall be deemed to have taken place if:

                  (a) any person as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the "Exchange Act"), and as

14(d) thereof, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act (a "Person"), but excluding the Company, any subsidiary of the Company and
any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company (including any trustee of such plan acting as
trustee), directly or indirectly, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
Rule 13(d)-3 under the Exchange Act, as amended from time to time) of securities
of the Company representing 15% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's then outstanding securities; or

                  (b) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the
Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a
majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be
considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the
Board; or

                  (c) consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation
or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or the acquisition of the assets of another corporation (a "Business
Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i)
all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
Company and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
immediately prior to such Business Combination


                                       3

beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the
then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the
then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of
such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's
assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries), (ii) no Person
(excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such
corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, 15% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding
shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed
prior to the Business Combination, and (iii) at least a majority of the members
of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of
the initial agreement, or of the action of the Incumbent Board, providing for
such Business Combination; or

                  (d) approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete
liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

                           (i) by the Company at any time within the first 24
                  months after a Change in Control;

                  (b) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Executive may terminate employment with the Company and/or any subsidiary for
"Good Reason" with the right to benefits set forth in Section 4 upon the
occurrence of one or more of the following events (regardless of whether any

                           (i) Failure to elect or reelect or otherwise to
                  maintain the Executive in the office or the position, or a
                  substantially equivalent office or position, of or with the
                  Company and/or a subsidiary, as the case may be, which the
                  Executive held immediately prior to a Change in Control, or
                  the removal of the Executive as a director of the Company
                  and/or a subsidiary (or any successor thereto) if the
                  Executive shall have been a director of the Company and/or a
                  subsidiary immediately prior to the Change in Control;

                           (ii) (A) A significant adverse change in the nature
                  or scope of the authorities, powers, functions,
                  responsibilities or duties attached to the position with the

                  immediately prior to the Change in Control, (B) a reduction in
                  the aggregate of the Executive's annual base salary rate and
                  annual incentive compensation target to be received from the
                  Company and/or any subsidiary, or (C) the termination or
                  denial of the Executive's rights to Employee Benefits (as
                  defined below) or a reduction in the

                  Company within 10 calendar days after receipt by the Company
                  of written notice from the Executive of such change, reduction
                  or termination, as the case may be;

                           (iii) A determination by the Executive (which
                  determination will be conclusive and binding upon the parties
                  hereto provided it has been made in good faith and in all
                  events will be presumed to have been made in good faith unless
                  otherwise shown by the Company by clear and convincing
                  evidence) that a change in circumstances has occurred
                  following a Change in Control, including, without limitation,
                  a change in the scope of the business or other activities for
                  which the Executive was responsible immediately prior to the
                  Change in Control, which has rendered the Executive
                  substantially unable to carry out, has substantially hindered
                  Executive's performance of, or has caused the Executive to
                  suffer a substantial reduction in, any of the authorities,
                  powers, functions, responsibilities or duties attached to the
                  position held by the Executive immediately prior to the Change
                  in Control, which situation is not remedied within 10 calendar
                  days after written notice to the Company from the Executive of
                  such determination;

                  consolidation or reorganization of the Company or transfer of
                  all or substantially all of its business and/or assets, unless

                  this Agreement pursuant to Section 9(a);

                           (v) The Company relocates its principal executive
                  offices, or requires the Executive to have his principal
                  location of work changed, to any location that is in excess of
                  50 miles from the location thereof immediately prior to the
                  Change in Control, or requires the Executive to travel away
                  from his office in the course of discharging his
                  responsibilities or duties hereunder at least 20% more (in
                  terms of aggregate days in any calendar year or in any
                  calendar quarter when annualized for purposes of comparison to
                  any prior year) than was required of Executive in any of the
                  three full years immediately prior to the Change in Control
                  without, in either case, his prior written consent; or

                           (vi) Without limiting the generality or effect of the
                  foregoing, any material breach of this Agreement by the
                  Company or any successor thereto, which breach is not remedied
                  within 10 calendar days after written notice to the Company
                  from the Executive describing the nature of such breach.

                  (c) Notwithstanding Sections 2(a) and (b) above, no benefits
shall be payable by reason of this Agreement in the event of:

                           (i) Termination of the Executive's employment with
                  the Company and its subsidiaries by reason of the Executive's
                  death or Disability, provided that the Executive has not
                  previously given a valid "Notice of Termination" pursuant to
                  Section 3. For purposes hereof, "Disability" shall be defined
                  as the inability of Executive due to illness, accident or
                  other physical or mental disability to perform his duties for
                  any period of six consecutive months or for any period of

                  independent physician selected by the Company and reasonably
                  acceptable to the Executive (or his legal representative),
                  provided that the Executive does not return to work on
                  substantially a full-time basis within 30 days after written
                  notice from the Company, pursuant to Section 3, of an intent
                  to terminate the Executive's employment due to Disability;

                           (ii) Termination of the Executive's employment with
                  the Company and its subsidiaries on account of the Executive's
                  retirement at or after age 65, pursuant to the Company's
                  Retirement Benefit Plan; or

                           (iii) Termination of the Executive's employment with
                  the Company and its subsidiaries for Cause. For the purposes
                  hereof, "Cause" shall be defined as a felony conviction of the
                  Executive or the failure of the Executive to contest
                  prosecution for a felony, or the Executive's wilful misconduct
                  or dishonesty, any of which is directly and materially harmful
                  to the business or reputation of the Company or any subsidiary
                  or affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive
                  shall not be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause"
                  hereunder unless and until there shall have been delivered to
                  the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
                  affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the Board
                  then in office at a meeting of the Board called and held for
                  such purpose, after reasonable notice to the Executive and an
                  opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel (if
                  the Executive chooses to have counsel present at such
                  meeting), to be heard before the Board, finding that, in the
                  good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive had committed
                  an act constituting

                  "Cause" as herein defined and specifying the particulars
                  thereof in detail. Nothing herein will limit the right of the
                  Executive or his beneficiaries to contest the validity or
                  propriety of any such determination.

         This Section 2(c) shall not preclude the payment of any amounts
otherwise payable to the Executive under any of the Company's employee benefit
plans, stock plans, programs and arrangements and/or under any Employment
Agreement.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control, the Executive may terminate
employment with the Company and any subsidiary for any reason, or without
reason, by providing Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 3 during the
30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the first
occurrence of a Change in Control with the right to the benefits set forth in
Section 4.

                  (e) Any termination of employment of the Executive, including
a termination for "Good Reason," but excluding a termination for "Cause," or the
removal of the Executive from the office or position in the Company or any
subsidiary that occurs (i) not more than 180 days prior to the date on which a
Change in Control occurs and (ii) following the commencement of any discussion
with a third person that ultimately results in a Change in Control shall be
deemed to be a termination or removal of the Executive after a Change in Control
for purposes of this Agreement.

         3. Notice of Termination

         Any termination of the Executive's employment with the Company and its
subsidiaries as contemplated by Section 2 shall be communicated by written
"Notice of Termination" to the other party hereto. Any "Notice of Termination"
shall indicate the effective date of termination which shall not be less than 30
days or more than 60 days after the date the Notice of


                                       9
<PAGE>

Termination is delivered (the "Termination Date"), the specific provision in
this Agreement relied upon, and, except for a termination pursuant to Section
2(d), will set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
provide a basis for such termination including, if applicable, the failure after
provision of written notice by the Executive to effect a remedy pursuant to the
final clause of Section 2(b)(ii), 2(b)(iii) or 2(b)(vi).

         4. Termination Benefits

         Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2, the following
benefits shall be paid or provided to the Executive:

                  (a) Compensation

                  The Company shall pay to the Executive three times the sum of
(i) "Base Pay", which shall be an amount equal to the greater of (A) the
Executive's effective annual base salary at the Termination Date or (B) the
Executive's effective annual base salary immediately prior to the Change in
Control, plus (ii) "Incentive Pay" equal to the greater of (x) the target annual
bonus payable to the Executive under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan
or any other annual bonus plan for the fiscal year of the Company in which the
Change in Control occurred or (y) the highest annual bonus earned by the
Executive under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan or any other annual
bonus plan (whether paid currently or on a deferred basis) with respect to any
12 consecutive month period during the three fiscal years of the Company
immediately preceding the fiscal year of the Company in which the Change in
Control occurred, plus (iii) "Performance Returns" equal to the highest annual
payment of performance returns paid to the Executive with respect to any 12
consecutive month period during the three fiscal years of the Company
immediately preceding the fiscal year of the Company in which the Change in
Control occurred.

                  (b) Welfare Benefits

                  For a period of 36 months following the Termination Date (the
"Continuation Period"), the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive with
benefits, including travel accident, major medical, dental, vision care and
other welfare benefit programs in effect immediately prior to the Change in
Control ("Employee Benefits") substantially similar to those that the Executive
was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date
(or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial
described in Section 2(b)(ii)(C)). If and to the extent that any benefit
described in this Section 4(b) is not or cannot be paid or provided under any
policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any subsidiary, as the
case may be, then the Company will itself pay or provide for the payment to the
Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits along
with, in the case of any benefit which is subject to tax because it is not or
cannot be paid or provided under any such policy, plan, program or arrangement
of the Company or any subsidiary, an additional amount such that after payment
by the Executive, or his dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, of all
taxes so imposed, the recipient retains an amount equal to such taxes. Employee
Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 4(b)
will be reduced to the extent comparable welfare benefits are actually received
by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period, and any
such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported by the
Executive to the Company.

                  (c) Retirement Benefits

                  The Executive shall be deemed to be completely vested in
Executive's currently accrued benefits under the Company's Retirement Benefit
Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") in effect as of the
date of Change in Control (collectively, the


                                       11
<PAGE>

"Plans"), regardless of his actual vesting service credit thereunder. In
addition, the Executive shall be deemed to earn service credit for benefit
calculation purposes thereunder for the Continuation Period. Benefits under the
Plans will become payable at any time designated by the Executive following
termination of the Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries
after the Executive reaches age 55, subject to the terms of the Plans regarding
the actuarial adjustment of benefit payments commencing prior to normal
retirement age. The benefits to be paid pursuant to the Plans shall be
calculated as though the Executive's compensation rate for each of the five
years immediately preceding his retirement equaled the sum of Base Pay plus
Incentive Pay plus Performance Returns. Any benefits payable pursuant to this
Section 4(c) that are not payable out of the Plans for any reason (including but
not limited to any applicable benefit limitations under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any restrictions relating to the
qualification of the Company's Retirement Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be paid
directly by the Company out of its general assets.

                  (d) Relocation Benefits

                  If the Executive moves his residence in order to pursue other
business or employment opportunities during the Continuation Period and requests
in writing that the Company provide relocation services, he will be reimbursed
for any expenses incurred in that initial relocation (including taxes payable on
the reimbursement) which are not reimbursed by another employer. Benefits under
this provision will include assistance in selling the Executive's home and all
other assistance and benefits which were customarily provided by the Company to
transferred executives prior to the Change in Control.

                  (e) Executive Outplacement Counseling

                  At the request of the Executive made in writing during the
Continuation Period, the Company shall engage an outplacement counseling service
of national reputation to assist the Executive in obtaining employment.

                  (f) Stock Based Compensation Plans

                           (i) Any issued and outstanding Stock Options (to the
                  extent they have not already become exercisable) shall become
                  exercisable as of the date on which the Change in Control
                  occurs, unless otherwise specifically provided at the time
                  such options are granted.

                           (ii) The Company's right to rescind any award of
                  stock to the Executive under the Company's 1988 Long Term
                  Incentive Plan or the Company's 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan
                  (or any successor plan) shall terminate upon a Change in
                  Control, and all restrictions on the sale, pledge,
                  hypothecation or other disposition of shares of stock awarded
                  pursuant to such plan shall be removed at the Termination
                  Date, unless otherwise specifically provided at the time such
                  award(s) are made.

                           (iii) The Executive's rights under any other stock
                  based compensation plan shall vest (to the extent they have
                  not already vested) and any performance criteria shall be
                  deemed met at target as of the date on which a Change in
                  Control occurs, unless otherwise specifically provided at the
                  time such right(s) are granted.

                  (g) Split Dollar Life Insurance

                  The Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum equal to the
cost on the Termination Date of purchasing, at standard independent insurance
premium rates, an individual


                                       13

paid up insurance policy providing benefits equal to the benefits provided by
the Company's Split Dollar Life Insurance coverage immediately prior to the date
of the Change in Control.

                  (h) Other Benefits

                           (i) The Executive shall have all flight privileges
                  provided by the Company to Directors as of the date of Change
                  in Control until the Executive reaches age 55, at which time
                  he shall have all flight privileges provided by the Company to
                  its retirees who held the same or similar position as the
                  Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control.

                           (ii) The Executive, at the Executive's option, shall
                  be entitled to continue the use of the Executive's
                  Company-provided automobile during the Continuation Period
                  under the same terms that applied to the automobile
                  immediately prior to the Change in Control, or to purchase the
                  automobile at its book value as of the Termination Date.

                           (iii) The Company shall pay to the Executive an
                  amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing any other
                  perquisites and benefits of the Company in effect immediately
                  prior to the Change in Control, calculated as if such benefits
                  were continued during the Continuation Period.

                  (i) Accrued Amounts

                  The Company shall pay to the Executive all other amounts
accrued or earned by the Executive through the Termination Date and amounts
otherwise owing under the then existing plans and policies of the Company,
including but not limited to all amounts of compensation previously deferred by
the Executive (together with any accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by
the Company, and any accrued vacation pay not yet paid by the Company.

                  (j) The Company shall pay to the Executive the amounts due
pursuant to Sections 4(a), 4(g) and 4(h)(iii) in a lump sum on the first

notwithstanding, but subject to Section 5(h), in the event that this Agreement
shall become operative and it shall be determined (as hereafter provided) that
any payment (other than the Gross-Up payments provided for in this Section 5) or
distribution by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to or for the benefit of
the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any
other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without
limitation any stock option, stock appreciation right or similar right,
restricted stock, deferred stock or the lapse or termination of any restriction
on, deferral period or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a
"Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code (or any successor provision thereto) by reason of being considered
"contingent on a change in ownership or control" of the Company, within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or to
any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with
respect to such tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and
penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments
(collectively, a "Gross-Up Payment"). The Gross-Up Payment shall be in an amount
such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest
or


                                       15
<PAGE>

penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax and any
income tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of
the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment.

                  (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(f), all
determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether an
Excise Tax is payable by the Executive and the amount of such Excise Tax and
whether a Gross-Up Payment is required to be paid by the Company to the
Executive and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, if any, shall be made by a
nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") selected by the
Executive in his sole discretion. The Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm
to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the
Company and the Executive within 30 calendar days after the Change in Control
Date, the Termination Date, if applicable, and any such other time or times as
may be requested by the Company or the Executive. If the Accounting Firm
determines that any Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the Company shall
pay the required Gross-Up Payment to the Executive within five business days
after receipt of such determination and calculations with respect to any Payment
to the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
payable by the Executive, it shall, at the same time as it makes such
determination, furnish the Company and the Executive an opinion that the
Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal,
state or local income or other tax return. As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) and
the possibility of similar uncertainty regarding applicable state or local tax
law at the time of any determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is
possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company
should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations
required to be made hereunder. In the


                                       16
<PAGE>

event that the Company exhausts or fails to pursue its remedies pursuant to
Section 5(f) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any
Excise Tax, the Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to determine the
amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and to submit its determination and
detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive as
promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the
Company to, or for the benefit of, the Executive within five business days after
receipt of such determination and calculations.

                  (c) The Company and the Executive shall each provide the
Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the
possession of the Company or the Executive, as the case may be, reasonably
requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting
Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and
calculations contemplated by Section 5(b). Any determination by the Accounting
Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be binding upon the Company
and the Executive.

                  (d) The federal, state and local income or other tax returns
filed by the Executive shall be prepared and filed on a consistent basis with
the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Excise Tax payable
by the Executive. The Executive shall make proper payment of the amount of any
Excise Payment, and at the request of the Company, provide to the Company true
and correct copies (with any amendments) of his federal income tax return as
filed with the Internal Revenue Service and corresponding state and local tax
returns, if relevant, as filed with the applicable taxing authority, and such
other documents reasonably requested by the Company, evidencing such payment. If
prior to the filing of the Executive's federal income tax return, or
corresponding state or local tax return, if relevant, the Accounting


                                       17
<PAGE>

Firm determines that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment should be reduced, the
Executive shall within five business days pay to the Company the amount of such
reduction.

                  (e) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its
services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by
Section 5(b) shall be borne by the Company. If such fees and expenses are
initially paid by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive the
full amount of such fees and expenses within five business days after receipt
from the Executive of a statement therefor and reasonable evidence of his
payment thereof.

                  (f) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority that, if
successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment or
any additional Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as promptly as
practicable but no later than 10 business days after the Executive actually
receives notice of such claim and the Executive shall further apprise the
Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is
requested to be paid (in each case, to the extent known by the Executive). The
Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the earlier of (x) the expiration of
the 30-calendar-day period following the date on which he gives such notice to
the Company and (y) the date that any payment of amount with respect to such
claim is due. If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the
expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive
shall:

                           (i) provide the Company with any written records or
                  documents in his possession relating to such claim reasonably
                  requested by the Company;

                           (ii) take such action in connection with contesting
                  such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing
                  from time to time, including without


                                       18
<PAGE>

                  limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such
                  claim by an attorney competent in respect of the subject
                  matter and reasonably selected by the Company;

                           (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in
                  order effectively to contest such claim; and

                           (iv) permit the Company to participate in any
                  proceedings relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such
contest and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Executive, on an after-tax
basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and
penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such contest and payment
of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
5(f), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the
contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 5(f) and, at its sole option,
may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings
and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided,
however, that the Executive may participate therein at his own cost and expense)
and may, at its option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and
sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any


                                       19
<PAGE>

Excise Tax or income or other tax, including interest or penalties with respect
thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, however,
that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes
for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which the contested amount
is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore,
the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues
with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the
Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

                  (g) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), the Executive receives any
refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's
complying with the requirements of Section 5(f)) promptly pay to the Company the
amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after
any taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an
amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), a determination is made
that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such
claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to
contest such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after
such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be
required to be repaid and the amount of any such advance shall offset, to the
extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid by the
Company to the Executive pursuant to this Section 5.

                  (h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if (i) but for this sentence, the Company would be obligated to make a
Gross-Up Payment to the Executive, (ii) the aggregate "present value" of the
"parachute payments" to be paid or provided


                                       20
<PAGE>

to the Executive under this Agreement or otherwise does not exceed 1.15
multiplied by three times the Executive's "base amount," and (iii) but for this
sentence, the net after-tax benefit to the Executive of the Gross-Up Payment
would not exceed $50,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise
Tax), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement
(including any stock based compensation pursuant to Section 4(f)) will be
reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so
that no portion of any payment or benefit to the Executive, as so reduced,
constitutes an "excess parachute payment." For purposes of this Section 5(h),
the terms "excess parachute payment," "present value," "parachute payment," and
"base amount" will have the meanings assigned to them by Section 280G of the
Code. The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to
be provided under this Agreement is required pursuant to the preceding sentence
will be made at the expense of the Company, if requested by the Executive or the
Company, by the Accounting Firm. The fact that the Executive's right to payments
or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this
Section 5(h) will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of
the Executive other than pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that any
payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is
required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 5(h), the Executive will be
entitled to designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to
give effect to this Section 5(h). The Company will provide the Executive with
all information reasonably requested by the Executive to permit the Executive to
make such designation. In the event that the Executive fails to make such
designation within 10 business days of the Termination Date, the Company may
effect such reduction in any manner it deems appropriate.

                                       21
<PAGE>

         6. No Mitigation Obligation. The Company hereby acknowledges that it
will be difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably
comparable employment following the Termination Date. Accordingly, the payment
of the severance compensation by the Company to the Executive in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged by the Company to be
reasonable, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any
payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise,
nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source
whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on
the part of the Executive hereunder or otherwise, except as expressly provided
in the last sentence of Section 4(b).

         7. Legal Fees and Expenses.

                  (a) It is the intent of the Company that the Executive not be
required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the
interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive's rights under this
Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would
substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive
hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company
has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the
event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action
to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or
other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive
any or all of the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive
hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to
retain counsel of Executive's choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter
provided, to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such
interpretation, enforcement or


                                       22
<PAGE>

defense, including without limitation the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any
director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in
any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client
relationship between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably
consents to the Executive's entering into an attorney-client relationship with
such counsel, and in that connection the Company and the Executive agree that a
confidential relationship shall exist between the Executive and such counsel.
Without respect to whether the Executive prevails, in whole or in part, in
connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely
financially responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses
incurred by the Executive in connection with any of the foregoing.

                  (b) Without limiting the obligations of the Company pursuant
to Section 7(a) hereof, in the event a Change in Control occurs, the performance
of the Company's obligations under this Section 7 shall be secured by amounts
deposited or to be deposited in trust pursuant to certain trust agreements to
which the Company shall be a party, which amounts deposited shall in the
aggregate be not less than $2,000,000, providing that the fees and expenses of
counsel selected from time to time by the Executive pursuant to Section 7(a)
shall be paid, or reimbursed to the Executive if paid by the Executive, either
in accordance with the terms of such trust agreements, or, if not so provided,
on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation by the Executive to the trustee
of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance with its
customary practices. Any failure by the Company to satisfy any of its
obligations under this Section 7(b) shall not limit the rights of the Executive
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the Executive shall have the status of a
general unsecured creditor of the Company and shall have no right to, or
security interest in, any assets of the Company or any subsidiary.

                                       23
<PAGE>

         8. Continuing Obligations

                  (a) The Executive hereby agrees that all documents, records,
techniques, business secrets and other information which have come into his
possession from time to time during his employment with the Company shall be
deemed to be confidential and proprietary to the Company and, except for
personal documents and records of the Executive, shall be returned to the
Company. The Executive further agrees to retain in confidence any confidential
information known to him concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and their
respective businesses so long as such information is not publicly disclosed,
except that Executive may disclose any such information required to be disclosed
in the normal course of his employment with the Company or pursuant to any court
order or other legal process.

                  (b) The Executive hereby agrees that during the Continuation
Period, he will not directly or indirectly solicit any employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies to join the employ of any
entity that competes with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
companies.

         9. Successors

                  (a) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in
form and substance satisfactory to the Executive to expressly assume and agree
to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
Failure of such successor entity to enter into such agreement prior to the
effective date of any such succession (or, if later, within three business days
after first receiving a written request for such agreement) shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to


                                       24
<PAGE>

terminate his employment pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii) and to receive the
payments and benefits provided under Section 4. As used in this Agreement,
"Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to
its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the
Agreement provided for in this Section 9 or which otherwise becomes bound by all
the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

                  (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the
Executive dies while any amounts are payable to him hereunder, all such amounts,
unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement to his devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such
designee, to his estate.

         10. Notices

         For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including
without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or
permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have
been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile
transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or five business days
after having been mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three business days after having been
sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such as FedEx, UPS, or
Purolator, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary of the
Company, with a copy to the General Counsel of the Company) at its principal
executive office and to the Executive at his principal residence, or to such
other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing and in
accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address shall be
effective only upon receipt.

<PAGE>

         11. Governing Law

         THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

         12. Miscellaneous

         No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged
unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by
the Executive and the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of
any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or
provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or any
prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by
either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement (or in any
employment or other written agreement relating to the Executive).
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties'
respective rights and obligations under Sections 4, 5 and 7 will survive any
termination or expiration of this Agreement or the termination of the
Executive's employment following a Change in Control for any reason whatsoever.
Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on
the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the
employment of the Company or any subsidiary prior to or following any Change in
Control. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement
all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is required to withhold
pursuant to any law or government regulation or ruling. In the event that the
Company refuses or otherwise fails to make a payment when due and it is
ultimately decided that the Executive is entitled to such


                                       26
<PAGE>

payment, such payment shall be increased to reflect an interest factor,
compounded annually, equal to the prime rate in effect as of the date the
payment was first due plus two points. For this purpose, the prime rate shall be
based on the rate identified by Chase Manhattan Bank as its prime rate.

         13. Separability

         The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

         14. Non-assignability

         This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto
shall, without the consent of the other, assign or transfer this Agreement or
any rights or obligations hereunder, except as provided in Section 9. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder
shall not be assignable or transferable, whether by pledge, creation of a
security interest or otherwise, other than a transfer by his will or by the laws
of descent or distribution, and in the event of any attempted assignment or
transfer by Executive contrary to this Section 14 the Company shall have no
liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned or transferred to any
person other than the Executive or, in the event of his death, his designated
beneficiary or, in the absence of an effective beneficiary designation, the
Executive's estate.

         15. Effectiveness; Term

         This Agreement will be effective and binding as of the date first above
written immediately upon its execution, but, anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement will not be operative unless and until
a Change in Control occurs. Upon the


                                       27
<PAGE>

occurrence of a Change in Control at any time during the Term (as defined
below), without further action, this Agreement shall become immediately
operative. For purposes of this Agreement, "Term" means the period commencing as
of the date first above written and expiring as of the later of (i) the fifth
anniversary of the date first above written or (ii) the second anniversary of
the first occurrence of a Change in Control; provided, however, that (A)
commencing on the fifth anniversary of the date first above written and each
fifth anniversary date thereafter, the Term of this Agreement will automatically
be extended for an additional five years unless, not later than 180 days
preceding each such fifth anniversary date, the Company or the Executive shall
have given notice that it or the Executive, as the case may be, does not wish to
have the Term extended and (B) subject to Section 2(e), if, prior to a Change in
Control, the Executive ceases for any reason to be an employee of the Company
and any subsidiary, thereupon without further action the Term shall be deemed to
have expired and this Agreement will immediately terminate and be of no further
effect. For purposes of this Section 15, the Executive shall not be deemed to
have ceased to be an employee of the Company and any subsidiary by reason of the
transfer of Executive's employment between the Company and any subsidiary, or
among any subsidiaries.

         16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same agreement.

         17 Prior Agreement. This Agreement supersedes and terminates any and
all prior Executive Termination Benefits Agreements by and among Company and the
Executive.

                                       28
<PAGE>

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be
executed and delivered as of the day and year first above set forth, thereby
mutually and voluntarily agreeing that this Agreement supersedes and replaces
any prior similar agreements for such termination benefits.

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.72

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                    EXECUTIVE TERMINATION BENEFITS AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE TERMINATION BENEFITS AGREEMENT
(this "Agreement"), dated as of the 5th day of January, 2004, is among AMR
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC., a Delaware
corporation (collectively the "Company"), and JAMES A. BEER (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders that its management be encouraged to remain
with the Company and to continue to devote full attention to the Company's
business in the event an effort is made to obtain control of the Company through
a tender offer or otherwise;

         WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a change in
control and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management
may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the
detriment of the Company and its stockholders;

         WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has determined
that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued
attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing
circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the
Company;

         WHEREAS, the Executive is a key Executive of the Company;

<PAGE>

         WHEREAS, the Company believes the Executive has made valuable
contributions to the productivity and profitability of the Company;

         WHEREAS, should the Company receive any proposal from a third person
concerning a possible business combination with or acquisition of equity
securities of the Company, the Board believes it imperative that the Company and
the Board be able to rely upon the Executive to continue in his position, and
that the Company be able to receive and rely upon his advice as to the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders without concern that he might be
distracted by the personal uncertainties and risks created by such a proposal;
and

         WHEREAS, should the Company receive any such proposals, in addition to
the Executive's regular duties, he may be called upon to assist in the
assessment of such proposals, advise management and the Board as to whether such
proposals would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
and to take such other actions as the Board might determine to be appropriate.

         NOW, THEREFORE, to assure the Company that it will have the continued
undivided attention and services of the Executive and the availability of his
advice and counsel notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a
bid to take over control of the Company, and to induce the Executive to remain
in the employ of the Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
Company and the Executive agree as follows:

         1. Change in Control

         For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control of the Company
shall be deemed to have taken place if:

                  (a) any person as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the "Exchange Act"), and as
used in Sections 13(d) and

                                       2
<PAGE>

14(d) thereof, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act (a "Person"), but excluding the Company, any subsidiary of the Company and
any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company (including any trustee of such plan acting as
trustee), directly or indirectly, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
Rule 13(d)-3 under the Exchange Act, as amended from time to time) of securities
of the Company representing 15% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's then outstanding securities; or

                  (b) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the
Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a
majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be
considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the
Board; or

                  (c) consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation
or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or the acquisition of the assets of another corporation (a "Business
Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i)
all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
Company and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
immediately prior to such Business Combination


                                       3
<PAGE>

beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the
then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the
then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of
such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's
assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries), (ii) no Person
(excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such
corporation resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, 15% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding
shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed
prior to the Business Combination, and (iii) at least a majority of the members
of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business
Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of
the initial agreement, or of the action of the Incumbent Board, providing for
such Business Combination; or

                  (d) approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete
liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

         2. Circumstances Triggering Receipt of Severance Benefits

                  (a) Subject to Section 2(c), the Company will provide the
Executive with the benefits set forth in Section 4 upon any termination of the
Executive's employment:

                           (i) by the Company at any time within the first 24
                  months after a Change in Control;

                                       4
<PAGE>

                           (ii) by the Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined
                  in Section 2(b) below) at any time within the first 24 months
                  after a Change in Control;

                           (iii) by the Executive pursuant to Section 2(d); or

                           (iv) by the Company or the Executive pursuant to
                  Section 2(e).

                  (b) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Executive may terminate employment with the Company and/or any subsidiary for
"Good Reason" with the right to benefits set forth in Section 4 upon the
occurrence of one or more of the following events (regardless of whether any
other reason, other than Cause as provided below, for such termination exists or
has occurred, including without limitation other employment):

                           (i) Failure to elect or reelect or otherwise to
                  maintain the Executive in the office or the position, or a
                  substantially equivalent office or position, of or with the
                  Company and/or a subsidiary, as the case may be, which the
                  Executive held immediately prior to a Change in Control, or
                  the removal of the Executive as a director of the Company
                  and/or a subsidiary (or any successor thereto) if the
                  Executive shall have been a director of the Company and/or a
                  subsidiary immediately prior to the Change in Control;

                           (ii) (A) A significant adverse change in the nature
                  or scope of the authorities, powers, functions,
                  responsibilities or duties attached to the position with the
                  Company and/or any subsidiary which the Executive held
                  immediately prior to the Change in Control, (B) a reduction in
                  the aggregate of the Executive's annual base salary rate and
                  annual incentive compensation target to be received from the
                  Company and/or any subsidiary, or (C) the termination or
                  denial of the Executive's rights to Employee Benefits (as
                  defined below) or a reduction in the


                                       5

                  scope or value thereof, any of which is not remedied by the
                  Company within 10 calendar days after receipt by the Company
                  of written notice from the Executive of such change, reduction
                  or termination, as the case may be;

                           (iii) A determination by the Executive (which
                  determination will be conclusive and binding upon the parties
                  hereto provided it has been made in good faith and in all
                  events will be presumed to have been made in good faith unless
                  otherwise shown by the Company by clear and convincing
                  evidence) that a change in circumstances has occurred
                  following a Change in Control, including, without limitation,
                  a change in the scope of the business or other activities for
                  which the Executive was responsible immediately prior to the
                  Change in Control, which has rendered the Executive
                  substantially unable to carry out, has substantially hindered
                  Executive's performance of, or has caused the Executive to
                  suffer a substantial reduction in, any of the authorities,
                  powers, functions, responsibilities or duties attached to the
                  position held by the Executive immediately prior to the Change
                  in Control, which situation is not remedied within 10 calendar
                  days after written notice to the Company from the Executive of
                  such determination;

                           (iv) The liquidation, dissolution, merger,
                  consolidation or reorganization of the Company or transfer of
                  all or substantially all of its business and/or assets, unless
                  the successor or successors (by liquidation, merger,
                  consolidation, reorganization, transfer or otherwise) to which
                  all or substantially all of its business and/or assets have
                  been transferred (directly or by operation of

                  law) assumed all duties and obligations of the Company under
                  this Agreement pursuant to Section 9(a);

                           (v) The Company relocates its principal executive
                  offices, or requires the Executive to have his principal
                  location of work changed, to any location that is in excess of
                  50 miles from the location thereof immediately prior to the
                  Change in Control, or requires the Executive to travel away
                  from his office in the course of discharging his
                  responsibilities or duties hereunder at least 20% more (in
                  terms of aggregate days in any calendar year or in any
                  calendar quarter when annualized for purposes of comparison to
                  any prior year) than was required of Executive in any of the
                  three full years immediately prior to the Change in Control
                  without, in either case, his prior written consent; or

                           (vi) Without limiting the generality or effect of the
                  foregoing, any material breach of this Agreement by the
                  Company or any successor thereto, which breach is not remedied
                  within 10 calendar days after written notice to the Company
                  from the Executive describing the nature of such breach.

                  (c) Notwithstanding Sections 2(a) and (b) above, no benefits
shall be payable by reason of this Agreement in the event of:

                           (i) Termination of the Executive's employment with
                  the Company and its subsidiaries by reason of the Executive's
                  death or Disability, provided that the Executive has not
                  previously given a valid "Notice of Termination" pursuant to
                  Section 3. For purposes hereof, "Disability" shall be defined
                  as the inability of Executive due to illness, accident or
                  other physical or mental disability to perform his duties for
                  any period of six consecutive months or for any period of
                  eight

                  months out of any 12-month period, as determined by an
                  independent physician selected by the Company and reasonably
                  acceptable to the Executive (or his legal representative),
                  provided that the Executive does not return to work on
                  substantially a full-time basis within 30 days after written
                  notice from the Company, pursuant to Section 3, of an intent
                  to terminate the Executive's employment due to Disability;

                           (ii) Termination of the Executive's employment with
                  the Company and its subsidiaries on account of the Executive's
                  retirement at or after age 65, pursuant to the Company's
                  Retirement Benefit Plan; or

                           (iii) Termination of the Executive's employment with
                  the Company and its subsidiaries for Cause. For the purposes
                  hereof, "Cause" shall be defined as a felony conviction of the
                  Executive or the failure of the Executive to contest
                  prosecution for a felony, or the Executive's wilful misconduct
                  or dishonesty, any of which is directly and materially harmful
                  to the business or reputation of the Company or any subsidiary
                  or affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive
                  shall not be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause"
                  hereunder unless and until there shall have been delivered to
                  the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
                  affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the Board
                  then in office at a meeting of the Board called and held for
                  such purpose, after reasonable notice to the Executive and an
                  opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel (if
                  the Executive chooses to have counsel present at such
                  meeting), to be heard before the Board, finding that, in the
                  good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive had committed
                  an act constituting


                                       8
<PAGE>

                  "Cause" as herein defined and specifying the particulars
                  thereof in detail. Nothing herein will limit the right of the
                  Executive or his beneficiaries to contest the validity or
                  propriety of any such determination.

         This Section 2(c) shall not preclude the payment of any amounts
otherwise payable to the Executive under any of the Company's employee benefit
plans, stock plans, programs and arrangements and/or under any Employment
Agreement.
                  (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control, the Executive may terminate
employment with the Company and any subsidiary for any reason, or without
reason, by providing Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 3 during the
30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the first
occurrence of a Change in Control with the right to the benefits set forth in
Section 4.
                  (e) Any termination of employment of the Executive, including
a termination for "Good Reason," but excluding a termination for "Cause," or the
removal of the Executive from the office or position in the Company or any
subsidiary that occurs (i) not more than 180 days prior to the date on which a
Change in Control occurs and (ii) following the commencement of any discussion
with a third person that ultimately results in a Change in Control shall be
deemed to be a termination or removal of the Executive after a Change in Control
for purposes of this Agreement.

         3. Notice of Termination

         Any termination of the Executive's employment with the Company and its
subsidiaries as contemplated by Section 2 shall be communicated by written
"Notice of Termination" to the other party hereto. Any "Notice of Termination"
shall indicate the effective date of termination which shall not be less than 30
days or more than 60 days after the date the Notice of


                                       9
<PAGE>

Termination is delivered (the "Termination Date"), the specific provision in
this Agreement relied upon, and, except for a termination pursuant to Section
2(d), will set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
provide a basis for such termination including, if applicable, the failure after
provision of written notice by the Executive to effect a remedy pursuant to the
final clause of Section 2(b)(ii), 2(b)(iii) or 2(b)(vi).

         4. Termination Benefits

         Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2, the following
benefits shall be paid or provided to the Executive:

                  (a) Compensation

                  The Company shall pay to the Executive three times the sum of
(i) "Base Pay", which shall be an amount equal to the greater of (A) the
Executive's effective annual base salary at the Termination Date or (B) the
Executive's effective annual base salary immediately prior to the Change in
Control, plus (ii) "Incentive Pay" equal to the greater of (x) the target annual
bonus payable to the Executive under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan
or any other annual bonus plan for the fiscal year of the Company in which the
Change in Control occurred or (y) the highest annual bonus earned by the
Executive under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan or any other annual
bonus plan (whether paid currently or on a deferred basis) with respect to any
12 consecutive month period during the three fiscal years of the Company
immediately preceding the fiscal year of the Company in which the Change in
Control occurred, plus (iii) "Performance Returns" equal to the highest annual
payment of performance returns paid to the Executive with respect to any 12
consecutive month period during the three fiscal years of the Company
immediately preceding the fiscal year of the Company in which the Change in
Control occurred.

<PAGE>

                  (b) Welfare Benefits

                  For a period of 36 months following the Termination Date (the
"Continuation Period"), the Company shall arrange to provide the Executive with
benefits, including travel accident, major medical, dental, vision care and
other welfare benefit programs in effect immediately prior to the Change in
Control ("Employee Benefits") substantially similar to those that the Executive
was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date
(or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial
described in Section 2(b)(ii)(C)). If and to the extent that any benefit
described in this Section 4(b) is not or cannot be paid or provided under any
policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any subsidiary, as the
case may be, then the Company will itself pay or provide for the payment to the
Executive, his dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits along
with, in the case of any benefit which is subject to tax because it is not or
cannot be paid or provided under any such policy, plan, program or arrangement
of the Company or any subsidiary, an additional amount such that after payment
by the Executive, or his dependents or beneficiaries, as the case may be, of all
taxes so imposed, the recipient retains an amount equal to such taxes. Employee
Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 4(b)
will be reduced to the extent comparable welfare benefits are actually received
by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period, and any
such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported by the
Executive to the Company.

                  (c) Retirement Benefits

                  The Executive shall be deemed to be completely vested in
Executive's currently accrued benefits under the Company's Retirement Benefit
Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") in effect as of the
date of Change in Control (collectively, the


                                       11
<PAGE>

"Plans"), regardless of his actual vesting service credit thereunder. In
addition, the Executive shall be deemed to earn service credit for benefit
calculation purposes thereunder for the Continuation Period. Benefits under the
Plans will become payable at any time designated by the Executive following
termination of the Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries
after the Executive reaches age 55, subject to the terms of the Plans regarding
the actuarial adjustment of benefit payments commencing prior to normal
retirement age. The benefits to be paid pursuant to the Plans shall be
calculated as though the Executive's compensation rate for each of the five
years immediately preceding his retirement equaled the sum of Base Pay plus
Incentive Pay plus Performance Returns. Any benefits payable pursuant to this
Section 4(c) that are not payable out of the Plans for any reason (including but
not limited to any applicable benefit limitations under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any restrictions relating to the
qualification of the Company's Retirement Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be paid
directly by the Company out of its general assets.

                  (d) Relocation Benefits

                  If the Executive moves his residence in order to pursue other
business or employment opportunities during the Continuation Period and requests
in writing that the Company provide relocation services, he will be reimbursed
for any expenses incurred in that initial relocation (including taxes payable on
the reimbursement) which are not reimbursed by another employer. Benefits under
this provision will include assistance in selling the Executive's home and all
other assistance and benefits which were customarily provided by the Company to
transferred executives prior to the Change in Control.

                  (e) Executive Outplacement Counseling

                  At the request of the Executive made in writing during the
Continuation Period, the Company shall engage an outplacement counseling service
of national reputation to assist the Executive in obtaining employment.

                  (f) Stock Based Compensation Plans

                           (i) Any issued and outstanding Stock Options (to the
                  extent they have not already become exercisable) shall become
                  exercisable as of the date on which the Change in Control
                  occurs, unless otherwise specifically provided at the time
                  such options are granted.

                           (ii) The Company's right to rescind any award of
                  stock to the Executive under the Company's 1988 Long Term
                  Incentive Plan or the Company's 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan
                  (or any successor plan) shall terminate upon a Change in
                  Control, and all restrictions on the sale, pledge,
                  hypothecation or other disposition of shares of stock awarded
                  pursuant to such plan shall be removed at the Termination
                  Date, unless otherwise specifically provided at the time such
                  award(s) are made.

                           (iii) The Executive's rights under any other stock
                  based compensation plan shall vest (to the extent they have
                  not already vested) and any performance criteria shall be
                  deemed met at target as of the date on which a Change in
                  Control occurs, unless otherwise specifically provided at the
                  time such right(s) are granted.

                  (g) Split Dollar Life Insurance

                  The Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum equal to the
cost on the Termination Date of purchasing, at standard independent insurance
premium rates, an individual


                                       13
<PAGE>

paid up insurance policy providing benefits equal to the benefits provided by
the Company's Split Dollar Life Insurance coverage immediately prior to the date
of the Change in Control.

                  (h) Other Benefits

                           (i) The Executive shall have all flight privileges
                  provided by the Company to Directors as of the date of Change
                  in Control until the Executive reaches age 55, at which time
                  he shall have all flight privileges provided by the Company to
                  its retirees who held the same or similar position as the
                  Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control.

                           (ii) The Executive, at the Executive's option, shall
                  be entitled to continue the use of the Executive's
                  Company-provided automobile during the Continuation Period
                  under the same terms that applied to the automobile
                  immediately prior to the Change in Control, or to purchase the
                  automobile at its book value as of the Termination Date.

                           (iii) The Company shall pay to the Executive an
                  amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing any other
                  perquisites and benefits of the Company in effect immediately
                  prior to the Change in Control, calculated as if such benefits
                  were continued during the Continuation Period.

                  (i) Accrued Amounts

                  The Company shall pay to the Executive all other amounts
accrued or earned by the Executive through the Termination Date and amounts
otherwise owing under the then existing plans and policies of the Company,
including but not limited to all amounts of compensation previously deferred by
the Executive (together with any accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by
the Company, and any accrued vacation pay not yet paid by the Company.

                                       14
<PAGE>

                  (j) The Company shall pay to the Executive the amounts due
pursuant to Sections 4(a), 4(g) and 4(h)(iii) in a lump sum on the first
business day of the month following the Termination Date. The Company shall pay
to the Executive the amounts due pursuant to Section 4(i) in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the existing plans and policies of the Company.

         5. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

                  (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, but subject to Section 5(h), in the event that this Agreement
shall become operative and it shall be determined (as hereafter provided) that
any payment (other than the Gross-Up payments provided for in this Section 5) or
distribution by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to or for the benefit of
the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any
other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without
limitation any stock option, stock appreciation right or similar right,
restricted stock, deferred stock or the lapse or termination of any restriction
on, deferral period or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a
"Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code (or any successor provision thereto) by reason of being considered
"contingent on a change in ownership or control" of the Company, within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or to
any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with
respect to such tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and
penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments
(collectively, a "Gross-Up Payment"). The Gross-Up Payment shall be in an amount
such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest
or

                                       15
<PAGE>

penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax and any
income tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of
the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment.

                  (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(f), all
determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether an
Excise Tax is payable by the Executive and the amount of such Excise Tax and
whether a Gross-Up Payment is required to be paid by the Company to the
Executive and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, if any, shall be made by a
nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") selected by the
Executive in his sole discretion. The Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm
to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the
Company and the Executive within 30 calendar days after the Change in Control
Date, the Termination Date, if applicable, and any such other time or times as
may be requested by the Company or the Executive. If the Accounting Firm
determines that any Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the Company shall
pay the required Gross-Up Payment to the Executive within five business days
after receipt of such determination and calculations with respect to any Payment
to the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
payable by the Executive, it shall, at the same time as it makes such
determination, furnish the Company and the Executive an opinion that the
Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal,
state or local income or other tax return. As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) and
the possibility of similar uncertainty regarding applicable state or local tax
law at the time of any determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is
possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company
should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations
required to be made hereunder. In the


                                       16
<PAGE>

event that the Company exhausts or fails to pursue its remedies pursuant to
Section 5(f) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any
Excise Tax, the Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to determine the
amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and to submit its determination and
detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive as
promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the
Company to, or for the benefit of, the Executive within five business days after
receipt of such determination and calculations.

                  (c) The Company and the Executive shall each provide the
Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the
possession of the Company or the Executive, as the case may be, reasonably
requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting
Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and
calculations contemplated by Section 5(b). Any determination by the Accounting
Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be binding upon the Company
and the Executive.

                  (d) The federal, state and local income or other tax returns
filed by the Executive shall be prepared and filed on a consistent basis with
the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Excise Tax payable
by the Executive. The Executive shall make proper payment of the amount of any
Excise Payment, and at the request of the Company, provide to the Company true
and correct copies (with any amendments) of his federal income tax return as
filed with the Internal Revenue Service and corresponding state and local tax
returns, if relevant, as filed with the applicable taxing authority, and such
other documents reasonably requested by the Company, evidencing such payment. If
prior to the filing of the Executive's federal income tax return, or
corresponding state or local tax return, if relevant, the Accounting


                                       17
<PAGE>

Firm determines that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment should be reduced, the
Executive shall within five business days pay to the Company the amount of such
reduction.

                  (e) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its
services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by
Section 5(b) shall be borne by the Company. If such fees and expenses are
initially paid by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive the
full amount of such fees and expenses within five business days after receipt
from the Executive of a statement therefor and reasonable evidence of his
payment thereof.

                  (f) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority that, if
successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment or
any additional Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as promptly as
practicable but no later than 10 business days after the Executive actually
receives notice of such claim and the Executive shall further apprise the
Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is
requested to be paid (in each case, to the extent known by the Executive). The
Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the earlier of (x) the expiration of
the 30-calendar-day period following the date on which he gives such notice to
the Company and (y) the date that any payment of amount with respect to such
claim is due. If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the
expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive
shall:

                           (i) provide the Company with any written records or
                  documents in his possession relating to such claim reasonably
                  requested by the Company;

                           (ii) take such action in connection with contesting
                  such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing
                  from time to time, including without


                                       18
<PAGE>

                  limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such
                  claim by an attorney competent in respect of the subject
                  matter and reasonably selected by the Company;

                           (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in
                  order effectively to contest such claim; and

                           (iv) permit the Company to participate in any
                  proceedings relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such
contest and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Executive, on an after-tax
basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and
penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such contest and payment
of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
5(f), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the
contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 5(f) and, at its sole option,
may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings
and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided,
however, that the Executive may participate therein at his own cost and expense)
and may, at its option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and
sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any


                                       19
<PAGE>

Excise Tax or income or other tax, including interest or penalties with respect
thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, however,
that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes
for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which the contested amount
is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore,
the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues
with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the
Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

                  (g) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), the Executive receives any
refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's
complying with the requirements of Section 5(f)) promptly pay to the Company the
amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after
any taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an
amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), a determination is made
that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such
claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to
contest such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after
such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be
required to be repaid and the amount of any such advance shall offset, to the
extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid by the
Company to the Executive pursuant to this Section 5.

                  (h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if (i) but for this sentence, the Company would be obligated to make a
Gross-Up Payment to the Executive, (ii) the aggregate "present value" of the
"parachute payments" to be paid or provided


                                       20
<PAGE>

to the Executive under this Agreement or otherwise does not exceed 1.15
multiplied by three times the Executive's "base amount," and (iii) but for this
sentence, the net after-tax benefit to the Executive of the Gross-Up Payment
would not exceed $50,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise
Tax), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement
(including any stock based compensation pursuant to Section 4(f)) will be
reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so
that no portion of any payment or benefit to the Executive, as so reduced,
constitutes an "excess parachute payment." For purposes of this Section 5(h),
the terms "excess parachute payment," "present value," "parachute payment," and
"base amount" will have the meanings assigned to them by Section 280G of the
Code. The determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to
be provided under this Agreement is required pursuant to the preceding sentence
will be made at the expense of the Company, if requested by the Executive or the
Company, by the Accounting Firm. The fact that the Executive's right to payments
or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this
Section 5(h) will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of
the Executive other than pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that any
payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is
required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 5(h), the Executive will be
entitled to designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to
give effect to this Section 5(h). The Company will provide the Executive with
all information reasonably requested by the Executive to permit the Executive to
make such designation. In the event that the Executive fails to make such
designation within 10 business days of the Termination Date, the Company may
effect such reduction in any manner it deems appropriate.

                                       21
<PAGE>

         6. No Mitigation Obligation. The Company hereby acknowledges that it
will be difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably
comparable employment following the Termination Date. Accordingly, the payment
of the severance compensation by the Company to the Executive in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged by the Company to be
reasonable, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any
payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise,
nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source
whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on
the part of the Executive hereunder or otherwise, except as expressly provided
in the last sentence of Section 4(b).

         7. Legal Fees and Expenses.

                  (a) It is the intent of the Company that the Executive not be
required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the
interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive's rights under this
Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would
substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive
hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company
has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the
event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action
to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or
other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive
any or all of the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive
hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to
retain counsel of Executive's choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter
provided, to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such
interpretation, enforcement or


                                       22
<PAGE>

defense, including without limitation the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any
director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in
any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client
relationship between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably
consents to the Executive's entering into an attorney-client relationship with
such counsel, and in that connection the Company and the Executive agree that a
confidential relationship shall exist between the Executive and such counsel.
Without respect to whether the Executive prevails, in whole or in part, in
connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely
financially responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses
incurred by the Executive in connection with any of the foregoing.

                  (b) Without limiting the obligations of the Company pursuant
to Section 7(a) hereof, in the event a Change in Control occurs, the performance
of the Company's obligations under this Section 7 shall be secured by amounts
deposited or to be deposited in trust pursuant to certain trust agreements to
which the Company shall be a party, which amounts deposited shall in the
aggregate be not less than $2,000,000, providing that the fees and expenses of
counsel selected from time to time by the Executive pursuant to Section 7(a)
shall be paid, or reimbursed to the Executive if paid by the Executive, either
in accordance with the terms of such trust agreements, or, if not so provided,
on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation by the Executive to the trustee
of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance with its
customary practices. Any failure by the Company to satisfy any of its
obligations under this Section 7(b) shall not limit the rights of the Executive
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the Executive shall have the status of a
general unsecured creditor of the Company and shall have no right to, or
security interest in, any assets of the Company or any subsidiary.

                                       23
<PAGE>

         8. Continuing Obligations

                  (a) The Executive hereby agrees that all documents, records,
techniques, business secrets and other information which have come into his
possession from time to time during his employment with the Company shall be
deemed to be confidential and proprietary to the Company and, except for
personal documents and records of the Executive, shall be returned to the
Company. The Executive further agrees to retain in confidence any confidential
information known to him concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and their
respective businesses so long as such information is not publicly disclosed,
except that Executive may disclose any such information required to be disclosed
in the normal course of his employment with the Company or pursuant to any court
order or other legal process.

                  (b) The Executive hereby agrees that during the Continuation
Period, he will not directly or indirectly solicit any employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies to join the employ of any
entity that competes with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
companies.

         9. Successors

                  (a) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in
form and substance satisfactory to the Executive to expressly assume and agree
to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
Failure of such successor entity to enter into such agreement prior to the
effective date of any such succession (or, if later, within three business days
after first receiving a written request for such agreement) shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to


                                       24
<PAGE>

terminate his employment pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii) and to receive the
payments and benefits provided under Section 4. As used in this Agreement,
"Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to

         11. Governing Law

         THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

         12. Miscellaneous

         No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged
unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by
the Executive and the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of
any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or
provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or any
prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by
either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement (or in any
employment or other written agreement relating to the Executive).
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties'
respective rights and obligations under Sections 4, 5 and 7 will survive any
termination or expiration of this Agreement or the termination of the
Executive's employment following a Change in Control for any reason whatsoever.
Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on
the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the
employment of the Company or any subsidiary prior to or following any Change in
Control. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement
all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is required to withhold
pursuant to any law or government regulation or ruling. In the event that the
Company refuses or otherwise fails to make a payment when due and it is
ultimately decided that the Executive is entitled to such


                                       26
<PAGE>

payment, such payment shall be increased to reflect an interest factor,
compounded annually, equal to the prime rate in effect as of the date the
payment was first due plus two points. For this purpose, the prime rate shall be
based on the rate identified by Chase Manhattan Bank as its prime rate.

         13. Separability

         The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

         14. Non-assignability

         This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto
shall, without the consent of the other, assign or transfer this Agreement or
any rights or obligations hereunder, except as provided in Section 9. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder
shall not be assignable or transferable, whether by pledge, creation of a
security interest or otherwise, other than a transfer by his will or by the laws
of descent or distribution, and in the event of any attempted assignment or
transfer by Executive contrary to this Section 14 the Company shall have no
liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned or transferred to any
person other than the Executive or, in the event of his death, his designated
beneficiary or, in the absence of an effective beneficiary designation, the
Executive's estate.

         15. Effectiveness; Term

         This Agreement will be effective and binding as of the date first above
written immediately upon its execution, but, anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement will not be operative unless and until
a Change in Control occurs. Upon the


                                       27
<PAGE>

occurrence of a Change in Control at any time during the Term (as defined
below), without further action, this Agreement shall become immediately
operative. For purposes of this Agreement, "Term" means the period commencing as
of the date first above written and expiring as of the later of (i) the fifth
anniversary of the date first above written or (ii) the second anniversary of
the first occurrence of a Change in Control; provided, however, that (A)
commencing on the fifth anniversary of the date first above written and each
fifth anniversary date thereafter, the Term of this Agreement will automatically
be extended for an additional five years unless, not later than 180 days
preceding each such fifth anniversary date, the Company or the Executive shall
have given notice that it or the Executive, as the case may be, does not wish to
have the Term extended and (B) subject to Section 2(e), if, prior to a Change in
Control, the Executive ceases for any reason to be an employee of the Company
and any subsidiary, thereupon without further action the Term shall be deemed to
have expired and this Agreement will immediately terminate and be of no further
effect. For purposes of this Section 15, the Executive shall not be deemed to
have ceased to be an employee of the Company and any subsidiary by reason of the
transfer of Executive's employment between the Company and any subsidiary, or
among any subsidiaries.

         16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same agreement.

         17 Prior Agreement. This Agreement supersedes and terminates any and
all prior Executive Termination Benefits Agreements by and among Company and the
Executive.

                                       28
<PAGE>

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be
executed and delivered as of the day and year first above set forth, thereby
mutually and voluntarily agreeing that this Agreement supersedes and replaces
any prior similar agreements for such termination benefits.

         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary

         such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
         information included in this report, fairly present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
         of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
         defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the
         registrant and have:

         (a)      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
                  report based on such evaluation; and

         (c)      Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's
                  fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
                  has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
                  affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
                  reporting; and

5.       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed,
         based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
         reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
         registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
         functions):

         (a)      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
                  financial information; and

         (b)      Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
