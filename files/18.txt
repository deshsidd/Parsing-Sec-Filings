PART III - NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Forms 10-K, 20-F, 
11-K, 10-Q, N-SAR, or the Transition report or portion thereof,
could not be filed within the prescribed time period.

          The Registrant's Form 10-K for the year ended October 31,
          1995 cannot be timely filed for the following reasons:

          (1)  In early January 1996 the registrant determined that
               previously reported sales and results of operations 
               for the first, second and third fiscal quarters of 
               1995 as well as for the fiscal years ended 
               October 31, 1994 and 1993 will require restatement 
               because certain previously reported sales were 
               recognized prematurely as criteria for revenue 
               recognition had not been met.  Such restatement has 
               not been completed as detailed below.

          (2)  At the time the registrant determined to restate its
               reported sales and results of operations it also 
               determined to review other accounting related matters 
               with its independent auditors and to engage an 
               independent consultant to advise the registrant in 
               connection with its financial status.  At such time 
               the registrant's corporate controller was relieved 
               of his duties and a principal of the independent 
               consultant was appointed chief executive officer of 
               the registrant's two operating subsidiaries.

          (3)  At such time the registrant also faced a severe 
               liquidity crisis and was working with, and 
               continues to work with, on a daily basis, its 
               senior lenders and major customers to reach
               a financial accommodation.  On January 26, 1996, 
               the registrant announced it had reached an 
               agreement in principal with its senior lenders 
               and certain major customers for a 90-day 
               financing arrangement which is expected to 
               allow the registrant sufficient time to pursue 
               the previously announced sale of its businesses.

          (4)  In connection with the foregoing, the registrant 
               is currently reviewing financial and accounting 
               matters with its independent consultant and 
               independent auditors and has neither completed 
               the restatement of its reported sales and 
               results of operations referred to in clause (i) 
               above nor closed its books for fiscal 1995.  
               The registrant's review of such matters is 
               ongoing and the registrant will complete the
               restatement and the audit of its fiscal year 
               ended October 31, 1995 as soon as reasonably 
               practical.

          The registrant does not expect to complete such 
          financial information prior to the time period 
          contemplated by paragraph (b) of Part II of this 
          Form 12b-25.

PART IV - OTHER INFORMATION

(1)  Name and telephone number of persons to contact in regard 
     to this notification

     WILLIAM J. MCCARTHY         (216)            946-2274
     (Name)                   (Area Code)    (Telephone Number)

(2)  Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 
     or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or 
     Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 during 
     the preceding 12 months or for such shorter period that 
     the registrant was required to file such report(s) been
     filed?  If answer is no, identify report(s). 
                                                /X/ Yes  / / No

(3)  Is it anticipated that any significant change in results 
     of operations from the corresponding period for the 
     last fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings 
     statements to be included in the subject report or 
     portion thereof?                           /X/ Yes / / No

     If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, 
     both narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, 
     state the reasons why a reasonable estimate of the results 
     cannot be made.

          Due to the restatement of the registrant's reported 
          sales and results of operations indicated above, 
          reported results of operations will be adjusted 
          downward.  In addition, as a result of such 
          restatement and in light of other matters currently 
          under review by the registrant it is anticipated 
          that the registrant's loss of its fourth fiscal 
          quarter of 1995 will be greater than the previously 
          announced estimate of $2.5 million.  Because neither 
          the restatement of the registrant's  financial 
          statements nor the 1995 audit have been completed, 
          a reasonable estimate of such loss cannot be 
          quantified at this time.  However, the registrant 
          does anticipate that the downward adjustment for 
          the fourth fiscal quarter of 1995 will be material.
